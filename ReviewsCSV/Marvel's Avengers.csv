Eurogamer,"True believer?For every one thing to love about Marvel's Avengers, there's something to cancel it out, as though it's a shiny machine that's been meticulously crafted by clever people in white coats and clipboards to neutralise every last drop of enjoyment. It doesn't matter what great ingredients you feed into the mouth of the machine - a loveable lead, perhaps, or a stellar voice cast - because by the end of it, the device works to counter every one of those positives with something irritating or frustrating. The result is a curiously bland, neutral experience that's neither terrific nor terrible but masterfully straddles both in a way that's quite frankly astonishing.To make matters worse, there are many times - usually within the mostly satisfying single-player campaign - when Marvel's Avengers isn't bland at all. Kamala Khan - aka Ms Marvel - is adorable, and her story, if a little predictable, hits all the beats you'd expect from a tale set in such an iconic universe. The combat is fine, if unrefined. The visuals are fine, if unremarkable. The looting is fine, if a bit useless. The environments are fine, if a bit repetitive. The gentle loot puzzles are fine, if shockingly simple. But fine isn't going to keep you here, is it? Fine isn't enough to make more demands of your time and money. And that's the problem. The single-player campaign is easily the game's strongest draw, offering an enjoyable, if rote set of missions that follow Ms Marvel's transformation from nerdy fangirl to bonafide superhero as she works to unite the posse after they disband, having been unfairly blamed for a catastrophic event. She joins the fight to clear their name and rescue the unsuspecting Inhumans snatched from the city streets, working to take down the villainous AIM organisation and its hordes of murderous robots along the way.Mechanically and visually the adventure is perfunctory. It's a tad rough around the edges, as though a lack of time or money - maybe both - prevented that final glossy spit-shine of polish. That's not to say I didn't enjoy myself because I very much did at times, but the Marvel's Avengers machine is too bloody good at counteracting the good bits by serving up something that will annoy or frustrate, too.Take, for example, the mission ""Starktech Outfits"". You're rocketing towards the exhilarating climax of the single-player campaign. It's been tense and exciting, and while the places you visit typically vary in name only - the AIM architects seemingly hail from the IKEA school of identikit design - there's no denying that you're getting close to a final showdown with the Ultimate Super-Villain antagonist... and then you're thrown into a tedious resource-gathering mission. It's not even that you've had these missions before - you haven't. But it's now, when you're around 90 per cent done and itching to take on the big bad - this is when Marvel's Avengers throws in a fetch-quest to gather electronic components from robotic corpses. While the enemies concerned aren't hard to find or destroy, there's currently no way to replay story missions, either, so there's no way to revisit an area where you've encountered them previously. Instead, you have to hop onto the War Table, pick a stray side quest you've yet to complete, and hope you'll find them. All momentum is shattered, leaving you frustrated and uncertain on what the hell you're meant to do next.Worse still, it's about as stable as a one-legged stool. I've had times where the dialogue is wrong, overlapping, or not playing at all. I once played half a mission seeing only the outline of Black Widow's skull and the backs of her camo-cloaked eyes. I was forced to buy gear from a new vendor - using up all my resources in the process - only for the item to never make it to my inventory. I didn't notice much stuttering and slowdown at the beginning, but the further into the story you go - and the more enemies that swarm on-screen - the more problematic it becomes. I've also had two hard crashes that forced me to reboot my PS4 Pro, and several occasions where loading hung indefinitely - an issue made all the more unbearable given how long Marvel's Avengers loading screens are anyway. Once, my co-op partner was stuck in the loading screen's helicarrier for a protracted period, yet could hear Hulk grunt and stomp around if he hit ""X"". That said, when I do get the right dialogue in the right places, good grief, does the diamond-tier voice cast show. It can't have been easy for them to come into a franchise as well-known and beloved as Marvel's cinematic universe and perform as such established characters, but even with the cheesy script, the voice work is impeccable. Troy Baker's contemplative, softly-spoken Bruce Banner is a particularly memorable performance, and one that's possibly my favourite of his to date. But while the game quite rightly ensures you spend time with every hero on the roster - and successfully unifies a single control scheme for multiple characters, which can't be easy to pull off - I came to loathe missions that forced me to play as Iron Man or Thor. Aerial combat is clunky to the point of frustration, while vaulting and parrying, too, are a little hit and miss. Combat is melee-based with a handful of ranged and special skills thrown in, and it's okay - even enjoyable at times - but the extensive skill trees don't add as much to the mix as you might hope despite each hero's bespoke abilities.Levelling up gear is useless to the point of disbelief - there is so much of it, there's little point boosting the power of anything until well after you've completed the campaign. Unlike Destiny - from which Marvel's Avengers' seems to draw much of its looter-shooter inspirations - there's no cosmetic benefit, and barely a tactical advantage, either, which makes you wonder why there are vendors or factions in the first place. Mission objectives are recycled to the point of tedium, and while upping the difficulty boosts the challenge and rewards, this leaves some encounters feeling peculiarly imbalanced. My favourite moments have been with a co-op partner at my side, times when we've synchronised attacks to wail on the same bad guy simultaneously, but the game fights at every turn to prevent me from doing that, too. You'll need to get through a couple of hours of the solo campaign before you even open up the War Table mission-select screen, and despite the fact your single-player missions are often populated with AI companions, you can't replace one with a friend. It's such an antiquated approach, and an odd design choice for a game seemingly so well-suited for co-op.Similarly, I don't understand why you're forced into a simulated HARM combat tutorial when you start the multiplayer mode, Avengers' Initiative, given the game all but insists you complete the solo campaign first. Why would anyone need another basic combat tutorial after finishing the 12-ish hour single-player content? It doesn't make sense. As for the microtransactions? I know there's a disingenuous trend of publishers deactivating the most egregious offerings until several weeks post-launch when people like me have already scribbled up our thoughts, but right now the offerings on Marvel's Avengers' marketplace truly are ""just"" cosmetic, and... well, dull, quite frankly. I don't particularly like the Hero Pass system - the individual battle passes locked to each hero - and like many of the game's live-service aspects, they feel inelegant and obtrusive, stapled onto a frame that didn't need it and can't properly support it. But the passes do offer some additional hero-specific missions, which are pretty enjoyable, so... I don't know. They're inoffensive right now - all six starting heroes boast ""free"" hero passes - but it'll be much harder to recommend future ones that want your real-life money (I know that completing a pass essentially ""refunds"" you the cost of it, but I'm not sure how feasible that is for most. We'll see, I guess.) As a live-service game, you can expect lots of tweaks and changes as the weeks morph into months, but having magpied so much from those kinds of games it's left with little identity of its own. Despite the promise of its campaign, its endearing cast and impressive voice work, Marvel's Avengers is an unoriginal and uninspired affair that falls sadly short of what it could have been - what it should have been.

Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.As the Marvel’s Avengers campaign ends, to be replaced by samey missions, it reminds me of the dual identity of so many superheroes. Avengers straps on its tightest, glossiest spandex for the campaign and dazzles with its moves, but once that adventure ends and it returns to the daily grind of a multiplayer-oriented endgame, it blurs into the crowd. Inoffensive, yet indistinguishable but for its famous superhero superstars.The frustrating thing about Marvel’s Avengers is that for the first few hours, you see hints of what it could have been—a visually spectacular and satisfying adventure—but then a functional, unoriginal loop of missions takes over, and you realise that that’s the actual game you’ll be spending most of your time with.The campaign offers a simple story, following future Ms. Marvel Kamala Khan as she seeks to reassemble the Avengers following a disaster that creates a wave of new superheroes labelled as ‘Inhumans’. You’re pitted against floating-head-with-tiny-limbs, MODOK, who’s intent on wiping out all Inhumans with the help of AIM’s Scientist Supreme Monica Rappaccini and her army of robots.A pretty regular Marvel setup then, and beautifully written, animated, and voice-acted throughout. I found myself actively looking forward to the cutscenes and snippets of in-game banter.The relationship between Bruce Banner and Kamala Khan unfolds beautifully. Banner’s unsure body language and mix of irritation and avuncular care he shows towards Khan—whose chirpy teenage optimism is just what 2020 needs—is a masterclass of voicework and mocap. It also elegantly addresses the fact that, to a 30-plus curmudgeon like me, the fresh-faced Khan can be kind of annoying, but her convincing character arc soon gets me completely onboard.Given the amount of big names the campaign has to introduce, it’s understandable that not all the relationships get the same level of attention, but each character still entertains as you bring the Avengers’ floating command centre back to life. The villain MODOK, with his pustulent, hypertrophic head that seems to swell up with every scene, is brilliantly brought to life. The performance turns one of Marvel’s goofiest-looking heroes into a memorable, eerily soft-spoken villain.However, once you’re aboard the Avengers’ Chimera ship, it becomes a little too obvious that you’re being roped into the publisher’s long game. You walk around on deck as your Avenger of choice, picking up time-limited challenges from vendors, buying gear using real or in-game currency, and using a map to freely drop into missions set across several biomes around the world. Some you do solo, others you do alongside up to three other Avengers, who can be controlled by AI or online players. I’d play with others where possible, and it speaks to the simplicity of the missions and combat that there’s not too much need for communication or a balanced squad.I did get to play online alongside Hulk wearing a Hawaiian shirt and fedora though.I’ve been reading a a little bit about performance problems on PC, but can say that my experience has been mostly stable. There were a couple of odd bugs during the campaign that forced me to restart the game, and multiplayer matchmaking has been very slow from my experience, forcing me to give up after minutes of waiting multiple times.The combat is a curious mix of classic brawler moves like juggling, suspended aerial attacks and light-heavy combos with the counter-and-dodge-based style of the Arkham games (there’s even a move where you jump over a shielded enemy’s head to break their shield). Little icons on the edges of the screen tell you how close a missile or laser is to blasting you away, while enemy melee attacks are telegraphed by coloured circles, which let you know whether to dodge or parry them. Get enough attacks together, and your rage meter fills, letting you unlock spectacular special moves like Iron Man summoning his Hulkbuster mech, or Ms. Marvel turning into a long-limbed giantess resembling a wacky waving inflatable tube girl.The icons give you a lot to think about while filling your screen with a confetti of mechanised enemies and special moves executed by your fellow Avengers, and it doesn’t always feel like you—or even the game itself—can keep up. A couple of dozen hours in, I’ll still often dodge instead of parrying when the enemy attack circle is white (dodge for red, dammit!), and that all-important telegraphing of enemy moves isn’t entirely consistent, and the camera’s a little too close for comfort - great for ogling Hulk’s slabs of back muscle, not so great for managing space in a scuffle.Playing as the speedsters of the group, Ms. Marvel and Black Widow, feels much better than Hulk, whose lumbering style doesn’t sync well with the already slowish animations and floaty jumping physics. High-flyers Iron Man and Thor, meanwhile, definitely offer a buzz as you can freely swoop into battle from way overhead of your buddies. Unfortunately finer aerial maneuvering and attacks are fiddly and much weaker than melee. It may be fun to fly, but the action’s really on the ground.But in a game so much about fan service, there’s something to be said for making each superhero feel unique, even if that is at the expense of balance. The characters move and attack just like you remember from the movies or imagine from the comics, right down to the disinterested way Hulk toe-pokes chests open. During these little moments, and amidst the on-screen muddle when you string together a bunch of counters and executions before letting rip with a hero’s special move, the superhero fantasy successfully shines.The bigger problems come later. Missions may be set all over the world, but levels themselves are sparse expanses of snow/forests/city where you hunt for crates hidden in metal bunkers guarded by faceless robots, before proceeding to complete a main objective—destroying a few structures, or holding onto some control points, Battlefield-style. The game tries to spruce things up with awkward platforming segments and hunts for SHIELD stashes (essentially a slightly better stash among endless stashes), but they’re visually ugly and unvaried, in stark contrast to the elegantly animated and designed superheroes that run around them.Also, for some reason the ‘Power’ level required for various missions is all over the place, greatly restricting the amount of missions you can tackle. I was quite up for a boss-fight mission that SHIELD offered for their daily challenge (which improves your faction rank with SHIELD, which lets you buy locked-off gear yada-yada), only to find that I was dozens of levels below being able to do it. These are the kinds of things that can be smoothed out over the coming months, but as things stand a good chunk of the endgame remains level-gated.Back aboard the Chimera, the metagame of daily challenges, endless gear upgrades (with daily ‘specialty’ items) and missions becomes particularly noticeable post-campaign. Without the more bespoke campaign-specific missions and story to break them up, the monotony begins to set in, and while there is an obsessive feedback loop to repeating missions, upgrading your gear, and improving your character in perpetuity, you don’t even get to see these gear upgrades. The only aesthetic changes are different costumes, which are a hard to find, and otherwise locked behind higher levels and real-world currency.There’s nothing too egregious about the microtransactions, which are purely cosmetic and also include emotes, nameplates and execution animations, but there’s nothing particularly satisfying to work towards in the endgame either.Perhaps a fleshed-out single-player campaign will never be enough to satisfy Avenger's marketing aims. The story is worthy of Marvel’s movie canon, but it’s too short and ends up being a shiny wrapper for what’s currently a rudimentary game-as-service.  This comes with the caveat that it’s just getting started, and there have been plenty of online-oriented games that started slowly. There’s enough button-mashy mileage in the combat system, especially as new heroes get introduced as DLC, but it’s the mission design and loot loop that let it down. It's just not strong or varied enough to justify the long-term investment the game wants from you.Not that justification beyond a 14-hour campaign and 'it’s your favourite superheroes and they look amazing' is needed for a day one purchase, based on the game’s early sales. But if Marvel’s Avengers wants to keep loyalists sweet and expand its player-base, it needs a lot more flesh on its vibranium skeletal armature. If only the game could carry some of its narrative prowess from the campaign over into the endgame.A well-told campaign and story do their best to mask a rather scrawny service game beneath.Robert is a freelance writer and chronic game tinkerer who spends many hours modding games then not playing them, and hiding behind doors with a shotgun in Hunt: Showdown.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The Marvel's Avengers marketing campaign and its multi-weekend beta buried the lede, guys. At the core of this loot-based, cosmetic-heavy, live-service game is a fantastic, roughly 12-hour campaign full of pathos, personality, and yes, a lot of punching. If you're surprised by that, you're not alone - I was shocked to complete the now all-too-familiar opening scene and dive into a captivating campaign centered around the perfect protagonist. So shocked, I didn't want it to end.If Marvel's Avengers is an Iron Man suit, Kamala Khan is its arc reactor, propelling the story forward and providing necessary emotional torque. She should have been featured in the marketing materials far more than she was, because she really is *the* Avenger in this game. Her story and the simultaneous story of the Avengers we know and love overcoming failure and crippling self-doubt in order to reassemble is a rock-solid one (and I dare say better than one or two of the Avengers films). Check out our review video below:But it's what comes after the campaign that causes Marvel's Avengers to stretch at the seams until it bursts. There’s simply just too much - too much insignificant gear and confusing numbers, too many rinse-and-repeat multiplayer missions that are full of too much punching and kicking enveloped in too many pulsing, over-saturated colors. Each side mission is like a souped-up Honda street racer that went overboard with extras - neon lights, glowing gauges, explosions, reflective metal, and pithy catchphrases slapping against your ears like a surplus of bumper stickers on a rear window. With Marvel's Avengers, there's a tight, emotionally resonant campaign… and then there's everything else. Like Kamala Khan struggling with her new Inhuman identity after exposure to Terrigen mist, this game can't figure out what the hell it is.In Kamala Khan, Marvel's Avengers gives us a beloved character not yet seen outside of the comics - that she's a Pakistani-American teenage girl dealing with social ostracization because of her Inhuman status only makes her story more relevant and poignant. Using her as the hub from which the plot spokes extend works well.Kamala opens the game at an Avengers event, where she takes a stand against some gatekeeping assholes, meets a few Avengers In the flesh, and shows off her pure and plucky nature. It's immediately after this warm, tingly opening that you're thrust into the A-Day tragedy - the same part from the beta. Once the ""Test Drive the Avengers"" portion is over, you're back in Kamala's world - let it wrap around you like a warm blanket that will be abruptly ripped off of you in your sleep. It's a shame that this isn't a standalone Kamala Khan game with fun (playable) cameos from other Avengers. While the rest of the team is played to uncanny valley perfection by a veritable who's-who of iconic VO actors, it's their interactions with Kamala that humanize them and make them unique characters outside of - but still tangential to - the MCU. Bruce Banner (Troy Baker) sees Kamala (Sandra Saad) as a problem to offload on someone else before seeing her as a peer with more courage than him. Tony (Nolan North) relishes her willingness to laugh at his one-liners, and gives her an early superhero costume pep talk that involves a promise to jazz up her burkini. Natasha (Laura Bailey) openly hates kids, but ends up giving Kamala her own version of a stunted, broken approval speech. And Thor (Travis Willingham), well, he remembers her from A-Day, which is honestly quite touching. Each one of these heroes has a moment where they need reassurance and validation, and Kamala rises to the occasion, reassembling the Avengers both physically and emotionally in a surprisingly good campaign - surprising not only because it's great, but because no one really knew it existed in the first place.Once you wrap up the core campaign, Marvel's Avengers' cracks begin to show - and those cracks become chasms faster than you can say ""assemble"". As someone who doesn't play live-service loot games or min-max until I’m blue in the face, I chose to focus on the initial story first before returning to the myriad side missions, HARM room training options, and the daunting task of navigating menus with bad UI. This proved to be an issue, as my endgame was a confusing one.Marvel's Avengers' post-game content is convoluted, to say the least. After completing the story, I couldn’t figure out how to get back to the Avengers’ ship because of the confusing UI and was stuck at the War Table until I reset the game. But upon getting back to the War Table, I'm greeted with (brace yourself) a few locations from which to choose, within which several mission options pop up for various types of missions for me to select (including faction quests, Drop Zones, Iconic Missions, Villain Sectors, and more). Then I'm thrust into a pre-match menu with various heroes and their various gear to pick from, upon which I'm dropped into a mission and immediately told that I have unequipped higher-level gear available. Are you exhausted? I am. And while Marvel's Avengers was certainly marketed as comic book Destiny, it wrongfully assumes half of its player base understands the myriad numbers thrust at them, or cares to pick through the heaps of gear trash they discover during the samey post-game missions. There's no justifiable reason for making an Avengers game centered around gear, except that the live-service, battle-pass friendly game with legs beyond its launch date is trendy right now. Which Avengers other than Iron Man and Black Widow are known for being sluts for gadgets? The fact that you craft in order to level up Hulk's muscle fibers to make an insignificant upgrade to his power level (which, BTW, is different from his hero level) means nothing to me, and I'm sure it means nothing to his angry green ass. Even when I tried to get on the loot treadmill and tediously break down my lower-level gear to make one of nine different crafting currencies that would enhance my higher-level gear, there was no discernible difference between the old gear I broke down and the gear I had just tinkered with. There's not even any aesthetic change (that's saved for cosmetics only), so you're just squinting at slightly different Black Widow belt buckles that each have convoluted cards touting their abilities. These are then presumably equipped under her existing uniform. What is the point?But what is it actually like to step into the Lycra of your favorite superheroes? Marvel's Avengers' button-mashing combat can feel fun and sometimes it can even feel like you can master that button-mashing to make certain heroes OP - with other heroes, however, it's an unenjoyable beat-em-up. Black Widow and Iron Man are two standouts, with extensive skill trees that let you stack cool new moves as you progress. Iron Man's flight feels just as good - if not better than - the Javelins in Anthem, and as I levelled him further I was able to add some seriously sick moves to his arsenal, including one where holding triangle while flying sends him shooting forward, criss-crossing lasers out of his hands. Black Widow is especially fun and fast and her skill tree evolves to a point that you feel like you're playing her in an MCU scene: Widow dashes forward and drop-kicks a mech, quickly gets to her feet and fires a grappling hook at a hovering droid that sends her careening towards it, whereupon she lands a front flip kick on the droid, drops to the ground, and fires a pistol at a mounted turret. Sick.Both Widow and Iron Man's ranged abilities make the endless mounted turrets that Crystal Dynamics jams into every mission a bit less irritating - if you're playing Hulk during a turret section, you'll be forced to rip up concrete from the ground and huck it at them individually, which gets old when there are six or so mounted to a damn building. Speaking of Hulk - his lumbering gameplay style doesn't jive well with the game's combat speed or its noticeably floaty physics. He feels nailed to the ground in almost every mission, and is largely unfun. Thor has a similar problem for me, in which his weightiness doesn't feel properly ironed out, while Kamala Khan is light and fun to play as, even though her moves do get stale. With the promise of DLC heroes down the pipe, it's easy to imagine how characters like Spider-Man and Kate Bishop will keep the combat feeling somewhat fresh - even if the post-campaign missions are staler than day-old shawarma pita. Does the promise of new heroes on the horizon mean this game has long-term legs? Unless there are some serious changes made to jazz up the post-game missions, it's hard to imagine anyone except for the gear-obsessed playing this in six months. There are also quite a few bugs skittering about Marvel's Avengers that Crystal Dynamics can and should address in future updates. Hulk seems perpetually buggy whenever he's an AI teammate - he froze while hanging from a wall in the HARM room twice, and there were several times when he flat-out refused to be revived no matter how long I stood in the little ring around him. I encountered several audio bugs, including one that had Kamala loudly shouting ""WOO"" in perpetuum until I triggered a cutscene, and one in which the Gear menu remained glued to my screen during a SHIELD faction mission. Sometimes it feels like the game is struggling to keep up with itself, like a Terrigen reactor on the brink of exploding.Marvel's Avengers has a glittery and joyous core campaign that manages to stack up to modern-day Avengers stories. Its gameplay is varied enough between heroes that there are shining stand-outs and ones that belong in the bin. But its chintzy game-as-service portion takes up too much time and bandwidth, ultimately crippling its chances of being a great game.Reviewed on PS4, code provided by the publisher. Alyssa Mercante is an editor and features writer at GamesRadar based out of Brooklyn, NY.

Metro GameCentral,"GameCentral gives its final verdict on Square Enix’s would-be blockbuster and finds a game with a secret identity crisis.The one benefit of reviewing a game after it’s launched – which is all you can ever do with games as a service titles – is that you get an early indication of how well it has been received by the general public. Not especially well seems to be the implication of the first week’s physical sales, with suggestions that the generously sized beta put off more people than it managed to attract. Which means the main question for this review is whether the beta undersold the final game or if the real problem is that it gave an all too accurate impression.One thing you certainly wouldn’t have guessed from the beta is that the main character is Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel, and that the story campaign is both primarily single-player and – relatively – good. We use that qualifier carefully as there are an awful lot of problems with Marvel’s Avengers, many of them on conceptual level. Most of them, though, stem from the fact that this is both a single-player action adventure in the style of Marvel’s Spider-Man and a live service looter shooter (well, looter puncher most of the time), inspired by Destiny.If that seems like an odd mix to you then you wouldn’t be wrong, as not only does the combination not work but the loot elements drag down everything else good about the game. However, things definitely start well, as the story focuses on Kamala coming to terms with her superpowers in a world where the Avengers have disbanded and an evil organisation called AIM has taken over. And yet by the time you reach the multiplayer-only end game everything has devolved into Destiny with punching… only somehow even more repetitive.The good news is that the first few hours with Kamala are great. She’s enthusiastic, charismatic, and empathetic in a way that most video game characters – even when they’re superheroes – rarely are. She’s also a Muslim, whose parents were originally from Pakistan, but her presence in the game’s roster is important in many ways beyond just improving diversity. As the only one out of the five heroes (Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America) that hasn’t been in the movies yet she’s also the only one that doesn’t look like a cheap knock-off of their cinematic counterpart.Although the game is ostensibly set in its own universe most of the character and vehicle designs are near identical to the movies, except never quite as good. The voice actors are all doing vague impressions of their filmic equivalents and the dialogue often tries to be quippy and funny (except when it comes to the tiresomely dour Bruce Banner and Hank Pym) but without ever raising a laugh.The game’s choice to copy the films – except not really because they haven’t got that part of the Marvel licence – rather than create its own style means it suffers in every comparison, from the instantly forgettable music to the generic dialogue and plot (the story steals liberally from X-Men 3, of all things).For a game that has more than 80 years’ worth of comic book history, and 12 years’ worth of movies, to pull on for inspiration this makes bizarrely little use of it. We mentioned in our review in progress that Taskmaster and Abomination are two of the supervillains in the game but what we didn’t realise at the time is that apart from the final boss they’re the ONLY supervillains, even though they both turn up in the first couple of hours and then play no further role in the story campaign.You can fight them again in various post-game multiplayer missions but for the rest of the game your only opponents are robots and nameless grunts in hazmat suits. The robots never talk or show any intelligence (even though it’s implied that head bad guy MODOK is controlling them with his mind), which makes for one of the least interesting line-up of enemies in any game ever – let alone one based on a licence that is filled with hundreds of bizarre and variously powered villains.The complete lack of characterisation for any of the enemies you fight is bizarre and really takes the edge off what is otherwise an enjoyable and relatively nuanced combat system. The lead designer worked on God Of War and there’s a similar sense of heft and impact no matter what character you’re playing as, but with a more complex array of moves and abilities that begins to creep into Devil May Cry and Bayonetta territory.However, since you can beat most opponents on normal difficulty just by button mashing the combat system never really gets the chance to shine, especially if you’re playing in co-op. Having multiplayer options in an Avengers game makes sense, obviously, but the way it’s implemented the screen just becomes an unreadable mess of colour and movement, with enemies constantly teleporting in or initiating unblockable attacks you never saw coming because the camera, including the useless lock-on, are so unhelpful.Your team-mates get in the way just as much as they help and the game offers no tools to aid communication or encourage tactical play. And for the obvious reason that neither are necessary: just keep punching and if you’re levelled up enough you’ll win eventually. If you’re not levelled up enough you have almost no chance, no matter how skilled you are, and so you’ll just have to go off and level grind in an easier mission (thankfully this is not really an issue for the story campaign, just everything afterwards).The entire game can be played in single-player if you want, with computer allies filling in if matchmaking can’t find a partner – or you don’t want one. Relatively few of the story missions involve co-op though, and even then rarely more than one team-mate. It’s the end game where the focus is squarely on four-player co-op, although by that time you’ve probably already had enough.There’s only the most basic puzzle-solving and platforming in Avengers, especially after Kamala stops being the main focus, with most missions quickly conforming to one of a disappointingly small number of templates. The one where you have to defend a small area, a bit like King of the Hill, while JARVIS hacks a computer, seems like half the game at times, but whether you’re destroying lab equipment or just beating up everyone in the room the actual objective doesn’t really matter.The location is irrelevant too, as you explore small open world areas in various outdoor locations, and a couple of cities, all of which are completely devoid of civilians and inevitably end with fighting indoors, in some kind of non-descript science lab. Avengers is another superhero game that fails to let you do anything actively heroic. A lot of bad guys get their faces punched in, but you rarely rescue anyone and never help foil a bank robbery or any of the fun stuff that actually happens in the comics and movies.The levelling up and impressively complex skill trees make sense in the context of superheroes but collecting loot certainly doesn’t. You might have a favourite gun or helmet in Destiny but here all the cosmetic changes are obtained purely through skins, so what you’re collecting are entirely abstract upgrades that exist only as a stat on your inventory page. Many only have a half-life of a few minutes before they’re replaced with another equally meaningless piece of loot, with the whole cycle quickly becoming a chore to deal with.The strangest thing is while this may have been originally designed to fleece you with microtransactions, the furore over Star Wars: Battlefront 2 seems to have caused a redesign mid-development and there’s actually relatively little to buy and almost all of it is purely cosmetic (each hero has what is essentially a battle pass, which includes resources to upgrade loot – which you can unlock by spending real money rather than earning it in-game, but that’s only of minor benefit).If Marvel’s Avengers is supposed to be a means to trick people out of their virtual small change it does very a poor job of it. The only thing it gets right is the combat and those parts of the story campaign that feel most like a handcrafted adventure and not just random multiplayer missions with a cut scene before you start – which accounts for roughly half of the 10-hour running time.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepFrom a technology point of view the graphics are decent, with some nice destruction effects, and while there are some problems with bugs and glitches, including crash bugs and broken matchmaking, we’ve certainly seen worse from an online game at launch. Although the mammoth load times are certainly an unpleasant comedown from recent Sony first party titles.It’s not the tech we’re worried about though but the basic design. With the right focus this could have been a great story-driven superhero game but instead it’s a muddled mess of incompatible gameplay ideas that bury enjoyable combat and a charismatic lead beneath a never-ending slurry of banal mission design. Marvel’s Avengers isn’t even very good at being a cynical cash grab, in a game that tries to do far too much and yet never wholly succeeds at anything.In Short: A jumbled mess that’s trying to be at least three different types of game at once, drowning out the enjoyable combat with a tsunami of repetition and meaningless loot.Pros: The combat system is good, with just the right amount of variety between heroes and their expansive skill trees. Kamala is great and deserves her own game.Cons: Insanely repetitive, with the worst loot system this side of Anthem. Unengaging plot and unambitious takes on the movie heroes and their world. No supervillains of note and lots of bugs.Score: 5/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, PC, and StadiaPrice: £59.99Publisher: Square EnixDeveloper: Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-MontréalRelease Date: 4th September 2020Age Rating: 16Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Game Informer,"Like the rampaging Hulk and his transformation into the brainy Bruce Banner, Marvel’s Avengers is a game of shifting personas and experiences. Developer Crystal Dynamics delivers a powerful superhero showcase that taps into each Avenger’s unique abilities to light up the battlefield in thrilling ways, but when the dust settles, it slows down to show a softer, human side that is every bit as engaging, placing a character you wouldn’t expect in the central role.Crystal Dynamics makes a huge gamble right out of the gate, delivering the message that even though the name Avengers is on the box, this is actually a story about a young girl named Kamala Khan – a huge fan of the super team.The opening moments show Kamala at an Avengers convention, geeking out when she meets the likes of Captain America and Black Widow. Kamala’s viewpoint as a little kid is a refreshing change of pace, and her excitement is likely in line with the player’s, showing an appreciation for these awesome heroes. It’s a fun way to kick off this story, but I was shocked by just how little screen time the Avengers get in early parts of the campaign. They are hardly featured within the first three to four hours of play, but it oddly works.The focus this time is instead on Kamala’s origin story and her growing into the role of Ms. Marvel. This coming-of-age tale is beautifully penned with some legitimately touching moments along the way. Even as she is learning about her powers, Kamala shows us she’s no slouch in combat, using a wild set of fun shapeshifting moves to pummel foes. While combat is the central hook, a good portion of Kamala’s gameplay is distinct and consists of frantic platforming.Ms. Marvel grabs onto ledges, tumbles when platforms crumble under her feet, and barely survives every big leap – all elements that recall Crystal Dynamics’ previous work on the Tomb Raider series. Kamala is even pushed to use stealth in a few sequences to sneak past AIM robots that serve MODOK, another character that is realized in awesome ways and is developed thoroughly from start to finish.The platforming action is differentiated by a superhuman element, allowing players to use Ms. Marvel’s stretching abilities to propel her great distances and feel like a hero. These sequences, while impressing with the level destruction often on display, are repetitive in their steps, and fail to deliver a true sense of danger. They do, however, aid the narrative and help Kamala further develop into the game’s most dynamic character. It’ a game about the Avengers, yet the true star isn’t part of their ranks. I love that the story takes chances to keep you off-kilter, all with a satisfying amount of narrative pay-off.When Ms. Marvel meets the Hulk in her attempt to reunite the team, the entire game structure transforms. It moves from linear, story-driven sequences to a hub format filled with deep RPG systems and a world map with a dizzying array of single-player and cooperative missions. I didn’t like hoofing it in the hub world to talk to various vendors, but the map is nicely designed and gives you all of the info you need before jumping into new critical-path missions or side activities.At this point in the game, Kamala Khan’s story remains strong, and is joined by mini-arcs for each of the Avengers. Crystal Dynamics did a nice job creating scenarios tailored to these heroes’ unique abilities.The Hulk is the unstoppable monstrosity you’d hope, smashing enemies and environments to bits. Thor’s Mjölnir absolutely wallops enemies, and each swing feels like it is delivered by a god. I also enjoyed the shield antics of Captain America (who doesn’t get much screen time for good narrative reasons), and the acrobatics of Black Widow. All of these heroes have great cinematic moments backed by huge gameplay setpieces. I don’t want to spoil any of them, but one cool sequence has you frantically running as the environment rotates around you. Crystal Dynamics also keeps you on your toes by challenging the norm for many of the heroes, putting them in situations where they may not have their gear or are wounded.Iron Man is the only character that I didn’t find enthralling. His gameplay isn’t bad, but it’s tedious; his ranged attacks aren’t much fun, and his close-quarters melee isn’t as impressive as the other heroes’. Nolan North’s performance as Tony Stark is good – his voice and delivery work – but the jokes are overdone, sounding like a one-liner machine on the fritz.All of the characters share similarities in button mapping, but feel distinct when it comes to combat and moves. Light and heavy combos abound for each hero, and are a blast to use. Each character also has a nice solution for ranged or airborne targets. The dodge, block, and parry systems are put to good use against almost every AIM enemy type, though your foes don’t have much variety.Every encounter and success feeds into an experience point system that allows you to level up and earn new abilities. Avengers offers a surprising amount of depth in this field. You can’t really spec out a hero differently than their base potential, but you can add extra moves to combos, speed up cooldowns on ranged attacks, and make each character more lethal in certain ways. There are over 100 abilities for each character. It’s a rewarding system that will keep you playing for a long time.Most of the critical-path missions are nicely designed and offer up plenty of rewards, but the same cannot be said of some of the side activities. For example, some assignments consist of destroying a just few things, so the mission is over almost as quickly as it began; I think I spent more time in the pre-match lobby (which can take time to load and find other players) than actually playing. You also get some odd control-point missions, which push you to stand on a spot to claim it, almost like Crystal Dynamics was thinking about competitive multiplayer ideas and just decided to use them here instead. The control missions are easy with other players at your side, but can be maddening with A.I., which rarely try to claim spaces.The heroes are better when they are united on the battlefield. The cooperative play is exceptionally good. Most environments are wide-open spaces that allow a full team of four to clobber enemies in style, and you can also up the difficulty with your friends to get better rewards and make the battles more dynamic.You are pushed to earn better gear to raise each of the heroes’ overall power ratings, which you need to tackle harder missions. You may have a power rating of 12, yet need 50 to stand a chance in a particular side mission. Crystal Dynamics clearly has played some Destiny, since the loot system, various currencies, factions, and hub world are nearly identical in concept.Most of the gear you gain isn’t shown cosmetically, and the influx of items makes the experience drag. Getting a +1 spinal cord for Hulk is just weird, and does +1 really make a difference? Sure, the loot makes heroes more potent, but it just isn’t fun to collect.Outside of legendary items, the one category of loot that is instantly satisfying is costumes. Crystal Dynamics loaded up on different outfits for each hero, and a lot of them are great nods to Marvel’s comic books. Getting the costumes either requires grinding to earn currency (of which there is an unnecessarily confusing variety), making progress on the Challenge Card (Avengers’ equivalent of a battle pass system), or getting a blueprint to fabricate.Nothing really comes quick in Avengers. I wouldn’t call the process a slog, as I had a good time playing missions with friends. However, it goes slowly, making it seem like the structure is designed for you to spend real money to progress faster.Crystal Dynamics wants you to play this game for years to come, and Avengers has plenty of content to keep you engaged at launch, but replaying missions on higher difficulties to get better gear won’t be enough down the road. It doesn’t have the competitive hooks of similarly designed games like Destiny. A steady drip of new stories and missions will be needed along with the announced heroes. Avengers is in great shape right now, dazzling with its story and action. I’m hooked on the end-game content that is available now, and I want to see just how powerful these heroes can become after leveling them completely.Avengers, assemble! You have a great game to play!

   on March 19, 2021 at 3:55PM PDTEditor's note: In March 2021, Publisher Square Enix released PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X ports of Marvel's Avengers. Like many “next-gen” ports, the new versions offer technical enhancements, including improved graphics and a higher frame rate. The PS5 version also features DualSense-enabled haptic feedback. Alongside those improvements, there's a new character--Clint Barton, the original Hawkeye--and a new set of story missions to match. Here are our impressions on Avengers' technical enhancements and latest content, written by Mike Epstein. Please continue after the break for our original review of Marvel's Avengers by Phil Hornshaw, first published in September 2020.Like so many games of the last few years, Marvel's Avengers gets a quick and easy technical bump when optimized for the current gen. On PS5, you get two choices: higher performance, at 60 frames per second with a dynamically upscaled 4K resolution, or to lock in 4K resolution and play at 30 frames per second. The larger, more tangible improvement comes from picking up the frame rate. Like other boosted ports, the smoother animation at 60fps makes the game better to watch and to play. Combos flow together more smoothly as you pummel robots into shiny, little pieces. And, while I could see some slight differences when I realy scrutinized both versions, you aren't losing any significant detail in performance mode.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Marvel's Avengers Video ReviewEither way, the technical upgrade just makes the game run better. Cutscenes that struggle and stutter on PS4 run smoothly on PS5. Some of the game's previously long load times have been cut to virtually nothing. A few spots, like the pre-mission character select screen, still take a little time to work through, but the time to get in and out of missions has improved substantially.On PlayStation 5 specifically, you also get a healthy helping of contextually creative DualSense haptics. Playing as Clint, you get a small amount of resistance in the triggers as you draw and fire his bow. It doesn't quite recreate that feeling of pulling a bowstring taut, but it serves as an okay tactile reference. The DualSense also amplifies the many controller rumblings sprinkled throughout the game, like when you highlight an option on the main menu or start sprinting. It's overused, but easy to ignore.None of these things drastically alter the repetitive brawling experience of Marvel's Avengers. The same can be said of Future Imperfect, the new set of Hawkeye-focused missions. The missions, which took me just over an hour to complete solo, aren't especially inventive. You get a couple of classic post-apocalyptic looks for a couple of characters, which is neat, but it isn't going to change your mind on the game or bring a lapsed player back into the fold long-term. All in all, Marvel's Avengers remains a game that shows flashes of greatness, but has yet to reach its heroic potential. - Mike Epstein, March 19, 2021. The original review, first published in September 2020, continues below.Marvel's Avengers is the Incredible Hulk of video games. The rage-filled Avenger and his scientist alter-ego are the same person and yet wholly different from one another, and Avengers is similarly split between two, sometimes diametrically opposed, personalities. One is a single-player story campaign that can be emotional and thoughtful, tuned to bring you into the shoes of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, while also spending time with them as people. The other is a multiplayer-focused live game full of huge levels where you punch all manner of enemies, without many worries as to why. Both sides work in their own way, but they never quite mesh, leaving Marvel's Avengers a somewhat confused, haphazard game--but a fun one, despite all its inner turmoil.Like the Hulk's mild-mannered counterpart, Bruce Banner, the single-player story campaign of Marvel's Avengers makes a strong first impression with its more thoughtful approach. It's set in its own alternate Marvel Comics universe where the superheroes that make up the Avengers--Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Thor--are famous and beloved. You start the game as Kamala Khan, a young girl who's a huge fan of the heroes, when she attends an Avengers celebration called A-Day in San Francisco. Soon, Kamala will become a superhero in her own right, following a terrorist attack and a tragedy that causes the Avengers to disband and spreads superpowers throughout a segment of the population. And while you'll spend time as each of the titular team, the single-player portion of Marvel's Avengers is really Kamala's story, and it works because she provides it a moral and emotional heart.But this is a superhero game, and that means there are supervillains--and they need punching. The core of Marvel's Avengers is an action-RPG brawler, with you playing a range of characters that deliver beat-downs to Marvel creeps such as Abomination, Taskmaster, and MODOK, as well as their many robotic and human minions. You're treated to a host of moves, which include light and heavy melee strikes, ranged attacks, hero-specific special abilities that have cooldown timers, and extra abilities triggered by using Intrinsic Energy, a resource that generally builds up over time and allows you to activate boosts for damage or defense. Combat in Marvel's Avengers is about stringing together combos and abilities based on the enemies you're facing, with various threats demanding that you kick them into the air to juggle them, break their shields with heavy attacks, or dodge and parry their incoming blows to defeat them.The fighting feels akin to Marvel's Spider-Man or the Batman: Arkham games, although the fighting in Marvel's Avengers adds spins of its own. The longer you play and the more moves you unlock by leveling up a hero, the more options you get in a fight. Avengers has a large and varied roster of enemies, and the further you get into the game, the more often you're made to consider how best to use your combos and superpowers to take down baddies, instead of relying on random button-mashing. You start as Kamala on her journey to become Ms. Marvel, while she works to find and reunite the Avengers. The heroes are needed to take on the threat of AIM--a technology company that produces killer robots and seeks to imprison and ""cure"" anyone who displays superhuman abilities. Before long, you're playing as each of the characters in turn as the story explores the Avengers' emotional turmoil from their failure on A-Day and the five years that have passed since. The strength of Marvel's Avengers is that while every character is stamped out of the same template--melee attacks, a ranged option, special abilities, and Intrinsic Energy--they all play very differently from one another. Iron Man is more of a ranged sniper than a melee brawler, for instance, and is easily laid low if the fighting gets too hot around him. Hulk, meanwhile, gains his Intrinsic Energy from dealing and receiving damage, so you're incentivized to wade straight into combat and smash as much as possible. Kamala gets a damage boost from using her Intrinsic Energy and unlocks additional moves that excel at knocking back and controlling groups of enemies, while Black Widow is a juggler who focuses on dishing out damage and is best at moving quickly around the battlefield to put down specific threats. The Avengers are all different enough from one another that playing each of them can feel like hopping into a separate game, and it's this variety that helps keep Marvel's Avengers interesting--especially as you get into its multiplayer-focused live game portion. In the campaign, all those characters allow you to explore different thematic levels that play to each of the Avengers' strengths, but it also causes the story to feel more disjointed. There's enough difference in the characters that jumping from Kamala to Hulk to Iron Man over the course of a few levels is less empowering than it is disorienting. There's a lot to know about each character, and handling each effectively takes practice and effort. Though the game dishes out character-specific tutorials, they pop up late and are optional. There's not really an elegant way for the game to onboard you with each of the characters, so the single-player campaign starts to feel like more of an extended tutorial to get you ready for the live game. However, the story is an engaging one, with Marvel's Avengers digging into the character-specific conflicts that added depth to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's take on the Avengers. It largely focuses on the relationship between the exuberant Kamala and the reluctant Banner, who's fallen into depression and despair in the years after A-Day. In Banner, Kamala finds a superhero mentor who helps her come to grips with who she is becoming thanks to her new powers, while Kamala helps give Banner the strength to step off the sidelines when he has the ability to change the world. The relationship between Kamala and Banner, and its twisted reflection in villains George Tarleton and Monica Rappaccini, is what makes the campaign of Marvel's Avengers work, and the time spent developing its characters makes them worth investing in.Not everybody in the story gets an equal amount of attention, though. Iron Man's conflict with Banner and how it affects Kamala are key elements, but Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America (who is killed during the events of A-Day) are largely ignored. In practice, the 10- to 14-hour campaign feels like it shortchanges some of the heroes to make room to cram in the Hulk side of Marvel's Avengers: the expansive, multiplayer-focused live game.While many of the missions you play in the single-player campaign are focused on a single hero or maybe a pair of them, by about the halfway point, they start to get combined with forays into the multiplayer offerings of Marvel's Avengers. These are missions of various sizes that you usually take on with a team of four superheroes, either controlled by other players or filled in with AI-controlled versions of the Avengers you've been ranking up and customizing throughout the game. Some of these missions are single encounters in locales like AIM facilities, where you do the sorts of activities you see in other live games--fighting off waves of enemies, defending a specific spot for a set amount of time, destroying a bunch of objects such as power generators, and taking down boss characters. In the bigger, more expansive levels, missions often have multiple steps as well as optional side objectives, such as solving simple puzzles to unlock doors or locating and killing a tough enemy.Playing with other humans especially, it's possible to find synergies between the characters' capabilities and their strengths and weaknesses. Iron Man and Black Widow are great at tangling up a tough enemy while Ms. Marvel and Hulk clear the crowds that fill in around them, for instance. Working together in a fight makes for some cool moments, and even with a team of AI characters, the bigger, tougher battles of Marvel's Avengers get pretty exciting as you smartly deploy your superpowers or get assistance from one of the other heroes.The trouble is, couched within the story campaign, these missions stand out as being a lot less focused. All the levels, even the biggest ones, are pretty homogeneous since they need to support all different characters equally. That turns them into little more than big fighting arenas that don't play to any particular strengths. They also do a lot to kill the pace of the campaign, cutting back on character moments so you can run around big chunks of the Utah Badlands or the Pacific Northwest forest, opening up chests and fighting random battles. Marvel's Avengers has all the trappings of a live game like Destiny 2 or The Division, with its social spaces, shopkeepers, faction vendors, and daily activities. The explanations for all these things are wedged in the middle of the campaign and, like the multiplayer missions, feel at odds with what the story is trying to deliver in its exploration of its characters.Once the campaign wraps up, you're left with just the multiplayer-focused side, which runs on continually throwing more challenging missions at you and gating those missions with gear requirements. All those treasure chests you open throughout Marvel's Avengers provide items for a loot system, in which you outfit your characters with equipment that has various stats on it. The overall average of your stats determines your Power Level, which has more granular stats that determine the damage you dish out or absorb. Power also dictates which missions you can handle and how tough they are.Like other live games, the loot chase is supposed to be the engine that drives your continued engagement--the chance at better, more powerful stuff is the reason to tune in every day or every week with your friends. On this front, Marvel's Avengers flounders a bit. Just about every piece of gear you'll find has interesting perks that can change the way you fight, offering advantages like defense against enemies with freeze weapons or allowing you to shrink or poison enemies as you pummel them. But it's only at the very top of the loot grind, as you near the cap of 150 Power, that you might actually start to bother looking at the gear you're using and what it does. Up until then, even items with good perks will get replaced in short order, since you'll continually pick up new gear with higher Power numbers as you play. Gear also doesn't affect how your character looks, which makes it feel even less consequential.The good news is that the loot chase isn't much of a loot grind. You can tear through levels at a pretty consistent clip, which keeps you from ever feeling like you're gated from content you want to play and forced to play stuff you don't. In the end, there's a fairly huge swathe of activities you can take on, with varying lengths, objective types, and difficulty levels. If you want a quick 10-minute experience, you'll have that option; if you'd rather dig in for 30 minutes or an hour, there are larger levels that can keep you busy. And the tougher they are, the more skill they demand from you in combat, and tapping into that depth is where the game excels.But like the Hulk himself, it all feels a bit chaotic and unfocused. The loot grind is ever-present but largely not something you really need to pay much attention to. Despite a lot of objective options, all the levels are relatively similar and pretty repetitive, sending you to a lot of copied locations like AIM labs or taking place on the same couple of big chunks of desert or forest. And when four heroes are wailing on the same big boss or giant robot, you lose a lot of the nuance of dodging, parrying, and constantly considering your attack options because it's hard to see through the confusion.Still, Marvel's Avengers does manage to scratch that live game itch, just like it scratches the itch for an emotional superhero story, and when its combat comes together, it can be very fun. Adventuring through the game with the different characters creates a ton of variety, which helps keep fighting a lot of the same enemies in a lot of the same environments feeling fresh. There's a lot to master for any given character, and with six on offer in the base game and more coming, experimenting with each one is a solid draw.The endgame does a great job of drip-feeding you additional activities as well, with each new level unlocking a newer, tougher one to go with a bunch of character-specific challenges to wrap up. The late-game Hive levels are essentially just five or six smaller missions stacked together and yet make for some very tough and varied fights and activities, especially at high difficulties. Fighting with human teammates especially can be a very good time. Whether you're on voice chat with friends or just picking up random teammates through the game's matchmaking, it feels good to find opportunities to help each other and work together to defeat tough foes you'd struggle facing alone. But the AI is good enough, on the whole, that you can play Avengers by yourself and stay engaged.After 50 hours with Avengers, I'm still interested in taking on tougher combat challenges and leveling up the rest of the characters--and I'm excited to see what developer Crystal Dynamics has in store with its take on four-player ""raid"" content, which is coming to the game later. There's also a lot of potential for expansions on the story side with additional characters coming to the game post-launch. They represent an opportunity for more intimate, character-driven episodes that tap into the best stuff in Marvel's Avengers, which would be a lot more enticing than just new characters to take through the same multiplayer missions.That interest has been marred along the way by technical snafus, though, especially of late. There were points throughout Marvel's Avengers when bugs popped up to break dialogue, disable interaction prompts, or load in too many copies of heroes for a mission. I've had issues where no enemies spawn during battles, or where a checkpoint doesn't trigger and a mission can't advance. Most of the problems are minor inconveniences, and some seem to have lessened since a patch was released with the wide launch of Marvel's Avengers.In the last few days, however, my game has suffered crashes and freezes often when I've played, seemingly with no cause. Though other GameSpot staff aren't reporting the same problems, posts on Reddit and Steam forums suggest I'm not alone in having major problems with the game. Sometimes I can play through a whole mission or two and even get a couple hours out of a play session, but other times, I'll get trapped on the start menu or see the game seize up repeatedly over a short period. Usually, the solution is a full restart of my computer, and attempting to fix the issue by downgrading graphics settings and hunting down new GPU drivers haven't alleviated the problem at all. I've managed to put in a lot of hours into Marvel's Avengers over the last week or so, but in the last few days as I've worked through the endgame, these problems have rendered the game unplayable at times.On the whole, I've enjoyed my time with Marvel's Avengers, and if Crystal Dynamics can deal with the technical issues plaguing the game, I'm looking forward to spending time mastering the combat styles of all the characters and exploring the expansions of its story the live game has set up. At times, Marvel's Avengers struggles to unify a thoughtful story focus with a more momentum-based, action-heavy live game system--but both have their good qualities. As with Bruce Banner and the Hulk, it'll be worth sticking with Marvel's Avengers to see how it might reconcile the two halves of its personality in the future to make something even better.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:A game trying to be many things at onceMarvel’s Avengers isn’t the game I expected.  Marvel’s Avengers is a big budget, Ms. Marvel-focused single-player game that just so happens to have the main cast of the Avengers along for the ride. It eventually pivots to try and become a Destiny competitor after the story is finished, but that story-focused campaign is a much larger part of the overall experience than I had imagined. The game’s latter, live-service portions do show promise, but the road between the game’s two halves is currently very rocky.Players are given two choices on the game’s main menu: campaign and Avengers Initiative. The Avengers Initiative option allows players to skip the game’s plot missions entirely and jump straight to the multiplayer, loot-grinding content. The game warns against doing this, however, and I agree.Besides, the single-player campaign is where I had the most fun with the game, by far.  Kamala Khan’s Ms. Marvel is the protagonist of Marvel’s Avengers, contrary to the game’s marketing, demos shown at trade shows, and even the game’s beta last month. The single-player campaign is her story. Khan is basically an over-excited, nerdy teenage fangirl with a bit of an Avengers obsession. Khan is our audience surrogate, someone just really excited to see the Avengers doing cool stuff, and who wishes she could be involved too. She’s a fanfiction-writing teenager who jumps and squeals with joy at seeing her heroes in person. She’s also a Pakistani-American Muslim, with a dorky, overprotective father and her own culturally relevant perspective on moral duty.What makes Ms. Marvel work as this game’s main character is that she hasn’t really been explored in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet, and has space to have her own narrative arc here that doesn’t feel like it’s treading on the toes of those movies. While the rest of the Avengers all have roles to play in the game’s story mode, most of them are stuck on the periphery. It’s assumed that you already know who these heroes are, and what they’re all about. She’s only the character who gets to have an arc, and grow, and develop as the game progresses, outside of the game’s villain.The plot set up for Marvel’s Avengers is basically a take on the Inhumans story from the comics. Due to a disastrous event seemingly caused by the Avengers, a bunch of regular humans unexpectedly develop super powers all across the American West Coast. Some of these are beneficial, and some of them are people catching on fire uncontrollably. The Avengers are blamed, these new “inhumans” are treated as inherently dangerous, and the AIM corporation takes on the task of tracking down these newly created super-powered individuals. It’s not a matter of if AIM will come for an Inhuman, but when.

  The single-player campaign is largely a simplistic power fantasy. Some missions have you play as specific characters, but you’ll often be able to pick from any characters currently present in the story to play as. Here are a few waves of robots, so smash them apart with a mix of light and heavy attacks mixed with dodges. Maybe an occasional enemy will have a shield, you might have to do a ranged attack on a turret, or you will on occasion have a boss fight that requires more thoughtful combat, but the single-player encounters are about feeling like a cool, powerful superhero. It feels a lot like playing a Marvel-themed Dynasty Warriors game at its best moments; you’re powerful as hell and are let loose to mow down waves of enemies that don’t stand a chance against you. Get in, let nothing stop you, get out.A big part of this simplicity is due to the fact that even by the end of the single-player campaign, you’ll have barely scratched the surface of most characters’ upgrade skill trees. As you play through the campaign or post-game missions, you gain experience in the background, occasionally earning skill points to spend on new abilities. While some abilities are locked behind leveling progression, you’ve usually got multiple upgrade options available at a given time, spread across different aspects of your character. There are separate upgrade trees for light attacks, heavy attacks, ranged attack, and special abilities, with upgrades ranging from new combos, to attacks that break through new kinds of defenses.Kamala Khan is basically our window into life as an inhuman. Very early in the game she’s on the run, judged as being dangerous simply for who she is, despite not having actually done anything wrong. Considering her character is a Muslim living in modern day America, she makes for an interesting window into the struggles of the Inhumans, with a perfect motivation to want to try and change things when even the Avengers have given up. She knows what it’s like to be seen as dangerous just for being herself, but she’s also idealistic and optimistic, and that really helps keep the core “the Avengers disbanded” narrative from getting too hopeless. The single-player campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is occasionally a little bit predictable, but the story managed to keep me on my toes even in the moments I could see a plot twist was on the way. Even when I knew something was coming, I never quite knew what it would be. I don’t want to spoil who the game’s main villain is, for those who have avoided spoilers thus far, but I will say I very much enjoyed that the game made use of one of Marvel’s more ridiculous and over-the-top characters for this story. They went with a villain who the MCU has not yet touched, and did a great job bringing them to life.The campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is around 12 hours long, and I was honestly surprised by how separated it felt from the game’s eventual live service content. If you are only interested in picking up Marvel’s Avengers as a single-player, action-adventure and dropping it as soon as that’s done, you can totally do that. Sure, you will have to put up with the game constantly reminding you with on-screen prompts that you’re not using the highest level gear for your character, but that’s about it. While some plot-based missions take place in environments I would revisit in the post-game content, a decent percentage of missions are crafted experiences, designed for specific characters and integrated into the plot in meaningful ways. Missions like sneaking through a memorial park to outrun the shadowy organization AIM, putting Iron Man’s suit together while under attack, or outrunning the Hulk in a crowded and unfamiliar space delivered compelling action, especially in the context of the wider narrative. The story mode isn’t simply plot painted over multiplayer maps, in other words.

  By the end of my time with the single-player campaign, most of my characters were level 10, out of a current level cap of 50, with probably two-thirds of their combat abilities not yet unlocked. Most of your coolest attacks, and most of the attacks designed to deal with more complex enemy patterns, are likely to elude you during the single-player campaign, and it feels like enemy difficulty is set to match that experience. The story mode is more about putting you in cool situations, rather than giving you a glimpse of the mechanically coolest things each character can do.But the most notable issue during my playthrough was a series of technical bugs, glitches, and performance issues. From multiple cutscenes where a hero’s hair or face failed to render, to a level where voice clips were stuck playing on loop, a game-breaking crash when walking through a door, to a faction rewards alert filling up my screen during an emotional late-game cutscene, I was frequently shocked by the number of unpolished edges in the game. Most of these issues were manageable, they just felt at odds with the game’s ambition. But overall, I thought the single-player campaign was enjoyable. From watching Kamala wrestle with feeling inadequate when suddenly thrust into working beside her idols, to the way the designers slowly reveal how bad things are getting for the Inhumans, and the small, joyous road trip interactions to the dramatic action set-pieces, it feels like a very human experience. Considering how much of the plot is centered on reducing the humanity of the Inhumans, it feels important that endearing human interactions are at the core of the story.So, once you’ve finished playing through the single-player campaign, how is the endgame  content? Well, the game has promise, even if the transition between single-player and live service is off-putting. When you initially finish up the game’s campaign, players are given a variety of missions to tackle, some more plot-based than others. While there is a continued story to explore once the credits have rolled, it is a far less guided affair, with a much less urgent sense of pace. A new villain is introduced without much fanfare, the reasons you’re sent on missions become more generic, and everything feels noticeably less structured. My first few hours after the credits rolled felt like I had been taken from the power fantasy and thrown into content I was under-leveled for. It was weird seeing The Hulk suddenly being taken out by a handful of basic enemies because their stats were higher than mine. I hadn’t yet unlocked the new moves and attacks I needed to make the transition into the post-game’s higher-challenge missions, and the first few hours soured me on the experience until I had time to adjust.Many of the post-game missions take place in identical buildings, placed into differing overworld locations. Every underground vault where I have to hack terminals to access resources has an identical interior. Every AIM base I infiltrate features the same three corridors leading to a large encounter space. You’ll be expected to visit the same location in two back-to-back missions and believe it’s actually two separate locations, because that’s what your mission briefing told you. Missions in the post-game all feature a fairly similar structure. Get dropped into a big overworld map, go find some optional loot chests if you feel up to it, defeat a wave of enemies guarding either a door or a mechanism that needs to be destroyed, maybe stand on some glowing squares to hack a computer, beat up some more enemies, repeat. It’s formulaic, and the kind of experience that lives or dies by you having fun with the moment-to-moment combat, outside of any plot motivation you might have for being there. When it’s working well, the fun is in seeing how quickly and effectively you can steamroll a room full of enemies. Then you get rewarded with some upgrade resources, or a new piece of gear, or some credits toward a new outfit, and continue.

  I stuck with a single character for a while, tackling the same handful of plotless missions over and over, focused on unlocking more of their skill tree, and eventually the post-game difficulty settled down a little. I don’t tend to picture third-person brawling games this way, but I had to level grind a little, and unlock some more moves, before playing the new story content felt manageable. New gear for all your heroes is plentiful, but ultimately feels a bit meaningless in the early post-game missions. Sure, I can get a new ribcage for The Hulk (yes, the Hulk gets new bones as mission rewards for some reason), break down any hulk ribs that have a smaller level than my current gear, then use resources from those broken down ribs to raise the level of my best set of ribs, but the act never feels like it’s making me more powerful. Moving from a level-22 belt for Thor, to a level-28 belt rarely makes any impact I can notice in the heat of battle. Some gear has specific bonuses, such as resistance to certain damage types or buffs to some attacks, but the bonus amounts are so small in the early post-game it’s tough to feel their impact.The gear system seems bolted onto the experience, without much care for how it connects to the narrative, or these characters. Beyond leveling up to get new moves, which does make me feel more powerful, I don’t feel any great excitement yet when stumbling on rare, high-level loot.Marvel’s Avengers works well as a flashy single-player action-adventure if that’s all you’re looking for, particularly if you’re already a fan of Ms. Marvel, and I can see value in picking it up for that alone. I’m a bit skeptical of the live service aspect’s ability to keep me grinding for loot once I hit the level cap, or finish the story-themed post-game missions, but now I’m over that initial hurdle, it is kind of fun to bash waves of enemies with friends.On a good day, Marvel’s Avengers is a multiplayer Marvel-themed Dynasty Warriors game, and if you’re in the right mood, that’s a decent way to spend some hours, and we don’t know where the team will take it from here. On a great day, it’s a strong single-player outing for one of my favorite under-appreciated superheroes. Whichever of the two you’re hoping for, there’s fun to be found here, if you set your expectations right. While the multiplayer may not have come out the gate swinging, there’s room for it to level grind a little over the coming weeks, and hopefully become more impressive at some point down the line.Marvel’s Avengers is out now on Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

Kotaku," There are many things I do not like about Marvel’s Avengers, one of the best comic book video games I’ve played. I don’t like grinding missions to earn more powerful equipment so I can take on more difficult missions. I don’t like my heroes’ inventories slowly filling with junk until I have to pause the game and spend 30 seconds dismantling useless garbage. I don’t like having to pick up faction missions in two different social spaces separated by minutes of loading. I don’t like spending five minutes traveling to a mission location only to have the game lock up completely, forcing me to restart. I don’t like endlessly repeating the same handful of boss battles against foes a full team of seasoned Avengers should be able to make short work of. But none of that can top the feeling of Thor’s hammer slamming into a robot’s metal body, Captain America’s shield flying true, Iron Man’s rockets hitting home, the Hulk’s Earth-shaking rage, Black Widow’s sting, and Ms. Marvel’s shapeshifting fists and feet. In the heat of battle, even a battle I’ve fought a dozen times, the sheer joy of being one of Earth’s mightiest heroes drowns out all of those little irritations. When I play Marvel’s Avengers I am a superhero. That’s exactly what I wanted out of Crystal Dynamics’ third-person comic book adventure. It helps that the game’s story campaign is basically a 10-12 hour superhero onboarding process led by one of the best new comic characters in decades, Kamala “Ms. Marvel” Khan. The Inhuman teen with her stretchy powers and boundless optimism is the perfect bridge between fans and heroes, being both herself. Without Kamala, there’d be no Avengers. The game opens on A-Day, a special event celebrating the esteemed super team. A young Kamala Khan is there, hoping to win an award for her Avengers fan-fiction, when disaster strikes. While the Avengers are distracted by an attack on San Francisco’s Golden Gate bridge, the experimental Terrigen reactor powering the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier serving as a fairground for A-Day overloads. The resulting explosion takes up a large portion of the city and seemingly causes the death of Captain America. Losing their leader and blamed for the disaster by the public, the Avengers disband. Five years later, teenage Kamala Khan stumbles across information suggesting the A-Day disaster was a setup. Transformed by the Terrigen mists into the shapeshifting Ms. Marvel, Kamala sets off on an adventure to bring her heroes back together to face the ever-growing threat of evil science organization A.I.M.Kamala is the heart of Marvel’s Avengers. Her enthusiasm and dauntless spirit are what drive the player as they slowly re-assemble the disassembled super team. I wasn’t as excited to unlock Iron Man or Black Widow as playable characters in the campaign as I was to see how Kamala reacted to them. The narrative isn’t quite as charming when the focus shifts to the more established heroes toward the second half of the campaign. As entertaining as Stark and Banner’s bickering is, I miss having my stretchy young hero by my side, providing her newbie hero perspective. Fortunately, the main narrative sticks the landing perfectly. I’d explain how, but that would be telling. The campaign is broken up into a series of missions. Kamala and the growing roster of the restored Avengers set out from their helicarrier base, attempting to thwart A.I.M.’s evil plan to harvest Inhuman powers to create an army of super androids. They’re dispatched to either high-tech A.I.M. bases, free-roaming wilderness areas dotted with A.I.M. installations, or the odd cityscape crawling with A.I.M. goons. There’s generally a main objective, like infiltrating a specific base, with a bunch of optional objectives achievable along the way. It’s up to the player to either make a beeline for their goal or wander about hunting for more powerful gear and other rewards before each mission’s main event. There’s a lot of re-use of terrain and locations going on, but that’s not painful until the post-campaign mission grind kicks in.During the campaign, I was too busy embiggening, smashing, thwacking, bashing, shooting, swinging, and flying to care too much about repetitive scenery. Fighting in Marvel’s Avengers is delightfully brutal. Punches and kicks have tangible impact. One can almost feel the recoil from Iron Man’s missile launchers. Being a third-person game and not an overhead affair like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, the action here is intimate and immediate. I haven’t felt as cool playing Captain America since 2011’s Captain America: Super-Soldier, the Sega game everyone forgets. And while I wish this version of the Hulk had the wall-scaling ability of the brute from 2005’s The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, I understand some sacrifices have been made to balance this team-based adventure. It wouldn’t be nearly as fun if every mission started off with Iron Man rocketing directly to the objective, so he has to fly slowly. It bugs me a little as a comic book nerd, but I get it. ""Some Assembly Required""Squad Goals SimulatorBeing the Avengers. Fighting as the Avengers. My new best friend, Kamala Khan. Endgame grindy bits, the odd lock up. Crystal DynamicsPlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC, StadiaSeptember 4, 2020Played campaign to the end of the main story and beyond, 69 percent complete. Played dozens of multiplayer missions. Leveled up Thor because Ari Notis wouldn't stop talking about that one Thor mission. What I really love is the different play styles within each individual character. In co-op, I have teamed up with players who charge into battle with Iron Man, flailing away with their fists and the odd laser blasts. My Iron Man is specced for missiles, so I like to hang back and rain down destruction. Were I more of a team player, I could spec my Ms. Marvel to have multiple charges of her heroic healing ability. I am not, so instead she kicks a lot more ass. Were Marvel’s Avengers just the campaign with a little co-op play and some character-specific side missions thrown in for good measure, I’d be perfectly satisfied. Crystal Dynamics could have stopped right there, maybe thrown in a bit of story DLC, and I would be the happiest Avengers fan ever. I’m still pretty damn happy, but I’m not a huge fan of the Destiny/Anthem-style multiplayer endgame. Once the campaign is over, you’re left with the “Avengers Initiative” post-campaign. It’s here I have to start travelling between the game’s two social spaces to pick up faction missions, grinding reputation so I can earn more powerful gear. Both the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the hidden base of the Inhuman resistance host faction coordinators who offer daily missions and assignments players can complete to earn faction reputation. The interface for accepting these missions gives me serious Destiny vibes. Meanwhile, missions are doled out via the war table. It’s a holographic map table filled with mission icons that would feel right-at-home in Anthem’s Fort Tarsis.See the icons with check marks beneath them on the map? Those are missions I’ve already completed. They are also missions the game would like me to repeat at higher difficulty levels for greater rewards. I understand there are folks out there who crave these sorts of grindy service games, but that’s not me. I’m almost jealous of my more games-as-service loving coworkers for getting more out of the game than I do.But I have gotten plenty out of Marvel’s Avengers. I’m still playing on a regular basis, not to level up my characters, but to enjoy the thrill of cutting loose as my favorite heroes. I’m looking forward to future character additions and the narrative missions they will bring. Some of the game’s character-specific side stories plant seeds that I’m really hoping come to fruition in future downloadable content. I’m also a huge fan of collecting alternate costumes, though not so much that I’d pay real money to do so. Even without its occasional glitches and hiccups, Marvel’s Avengers is no Spider-Man PS4. But Spider-Man PS4 only gives players the experience of playing as one superhero. That’s relatively easy. Avengers does a damn good job of bringing six wildly diverse superheroes to life, somehow making wielding the power of a literal god as satisfying as being a normal human shooting robots in the face with a pair of pistols. And there are more heroes on the way, including not one but two bow-and-arrow-sporting Hawkeyes. I can’t wait to take down a robotic tank with a piece of wood propelled by a taut string.Marvel’s Avengers isn’t the best comic book game out there, but it’s certainly the best team-based comic book game I’ve played. It’s not simply that it gathers iconic heroes together and lets me become them, but that each one of them is equally enjoyable. When the first couple of minutes of any session is spent picking out which character I want to play as, something has gone wonderfully right, which makes overlooking all the little things I don’t like that much easier. Marvel’s Avengers becomes a different game once you wrap up the campaign. Though the…When you think of the Avengers, you think Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and Black Widow,…Marvel’s Avengers, officially out today for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, send players directly…There’s a cloud hanging over Marvel’s Avengers.

MARVEL’S AVENGERS REVIEW FOR PC, PS4, XBOX ONE, AND GOOGLE STADIA. Following the sensational Endgame movie, the excitement surrounding the Avengers is surely at an all-time high. It seems like the perfect opportunity for this new Marvel’s Avengers game to swoop in and capitalize on the hype. Give the players Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Black Widow, throw in Ms. Marvel to keep things fresh, and let them play superheroes together. Sounds like a damn good time to me!Unfortunately, Marvel’s Avengers goes too far off-track to be saved by its heroes, resulting in a mostly functional, yet disappointing loot-based brawler. After 10 hours of campaign gameplay and 10 more hours of multiplayer, it’s time to get into it.Marvel’s Avengers’ campaign starts strong, with the fun introduction of superhero fan Kamala Khan attending an Avengers event in San Francisco. Our protagonist is a finalist in a fanfiction competition, which leads to her meeting the Avengers. She awkwardly interacts with the different heroes and it’s easy to fall in love with her wide-eyed enthusiasm. It’s also great how the heroes are aware of their comic book presence and influence, though this unique element is quickly dropped.After an optimistic beginning, chaos soon strikes San Francisco which spells disaster for superpowered beings, pejoratively referred to as “Inhumans,”  including the Avengers who end up broken and separated. Soon after, the player regains control of the now-stretchy Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) as she works to find the Avengers and fight back against a new enemy. Sadly, this new enemy is pretty boring by Marvel supervillain standards, backed up by lieutenants who aren’t much better.It’s unfortunate that, after 2-3 hours of promising content, where the focus is on a single or pair of characters, the game takes a jarring turn with its four-player missions that are filled with repetitive objectives. You have to endure 5-6 hours of clearing rooms and defending points with little in the way of exciting context before the final mission eventually pops up. This finale thankfully pulls things back to the more linear, focused mission design with cool set pieces, acting as a reminder of the game’s strong start, but it’s too little, too late.It’s as though another developer took over the reins partway through creation — which may have actually happened, given the “five core studios” working on this title — before giving them back for the story’s ending.Visually, the game looks serviceable. There are moments when you do want to stop and use the included photo mode, mainly during combat where the particle effects can get wild, but these are few and far between. It’s the environments that ultimately let the presentation down with the limited mix of barren wastelands and science lab corridors blurring together and rarely looking interesting.Animations can also get a little funky and bug out at times, to the point of evoking memories of jankier, pre-Arkham superhero games. It should look and feel like a step forward, but it doesn’t. Iffy animations paired with samey enemies and outrageously contrived objectives make Marvel’s Avengers feel behind where a 2020 game should be.Navigating the messy menus is a chore made worse by poor loading times. Even between tabs, there’s a hiccup while everything gets ready. Those poor loading times extend to the load screens, where you have to wait for an age for missions to get started. This is made worse when searching for players or trying to successfully invite friends.Using the “4K” option on my PS4 Pro, I found the 30 FPS limit to be more preferable to the inconsistent “Performance” mode. While the game was largely stable for the most part, there were moments of clear slowdown when large groups of enemies appeared onscreen. I fear for those playing on lesser hardware like the base PS4 and Xbox One, and look forward to the more stable performance on the next-gen versions.Despite the outrage aimed at the Marvel’s Avengers cast of heroes not looking like the Marvel Cinematic Universe actors, I found it pretty easy to get used to the character models and the voice actors. Sure, it’s initially jarring to see Iron Man replaced with a Robert Downey Jr. lookalike rather than the man himself, but that soon wears off. While they remain pretty flat personality-wise, in combat they all start to shine as you level them up and unlock new skills.Initially, combat feels like a step backward when compared to top-tier brawlers like the Batman: Arkham series or Marvel’s Spider-Man, which focus more on rhythm and timing. You don’t get that fluidity in Marvel’s Avengers and it can be frustrating to see your character going against your input. However, this game does lead to some satisfaction further down the line, as you learn more skills that can devastate the opposition and enhance your survivability. It’s just a shame that those initial levels are spent less like a hero and more like a coward, playing on the defensive and searching for health drops.While characters can feel a little samey at the start, the vast number of abilities to unlock eventually make them unique, with distinct roles. Playing as Iron Man, I know that I can fly around and take out pesky drones at the start of a fight. As the Hulk, I can deal big area-of-effect damage and juggle enemies in the air for the rest of my team to keep combos going. Once leveled up, Thor goes from being a God of War‘s Kratos wannabe to a big-damage thunder god with his own awesome combos and tricks.I’m sure Captain America, Black Widow, and Ms. Marvel can also dish out some tough love, as I’ve seen teammates use them to great effect. Of course, I’ll need to level them up myself to know for sure. Despite having 20 total hours played, I’m still far from getting everyone up to max level and a high Gear Score. The grind is pretty real and currently requires players to cycle through the same missions over and over again as the most efficient way to progress. Sure, other content is coming in the future, but it’s not here yet.Unfortunately, though the combat eventually becomes pleasing, there is little variety in the enemies you face or the areas you fight in. Mission modifiers can alter the challenge but rarely do they make the missions more enjoyable. In fact, they often make missions more frustrating, like the modifier that buffs incoming ranged attack damage! Combat in the tighter-focused story missions shines brightest, I feel, but it just doesn’t scale well when more friendlies and enemies are introduced.In a perfect scenario, matchmaking would work every time and you would get three other capable players whose heroes synergize well with your own choice. You’d combine efforts to stagger enemies and take them out in a coordinated assault. This rarely happens, however, with matchmaking often refusing to fill my party for one reason or another, and so A.I. characters take control. The friendly A.I. isn’t so bad and will revive you when you go down, but for an online co-op experience, there is bizarrely little in the way of actual online co-op.Quick Match can help you find other players, but you can only do that as a solo. My party of two couldn’t use this feature, which meant searching for players and usually only finding one person. This was tested during the launch weekend, but I still struggled to pull together full player parties.It also seems like the level scaling is a little out of wack. I had a low-level player join me and the game appeared to average out the mission level. So I would find the level very easy, while the other player found it incredibly difficult. That was a poor experience for both of us.So what about the loot in this loot-based brawler? The truth is that, until the extreme endgame, I rarely thought about it. I would just hold a button to automatically equip whichever items had the highest number assigned to them and then carry on playing. Gear drops don’t change your character’s appearance, either, making them even more forgettable.There are some interesting qualities to the loot in the buffs they provide and how they counter certain enemy types, but it means spending more time in the dreadful menus when I’d rather just be enjoying the combat. Of course, you can’t do that without equipping bigger-numbered Gear to do more damage, so you have to succumb to the notifications and interruptions.Gear Score is just so out of place in Marvel’s Avengers. It makes a bad first impression when it pops up in the Campaign and that stays with you until the true endgame grind, where you get Legendary Gear that can significantly shake up the way a character plays. A clone of the loot grind found in Destiny, The Division, and Anthem feels out of place here, resulting in convoluted systems that end up hindering the experience.What’s confusing is that there are also separate outfits that are purely cosmetic. In a perfect world where microtransactions haven’t influenced gameplay and overall player enjoyment, it would be these outfits that have different effects tied to them. Gear wouldn’t be a thing that players needed to worry about, as they could instead just equip Iron Man’s freeze-protection suit or Black Widow’s super stealth suit, or whatever. Then your teammates could identify your playstyle and skills by seeing what you’re wearing for a simpler, more streamlined experience.$60 gets you the base game. Then there’s a Marketplace where you can spend real money on expensive cosmetic items. Frankly, most of them look pretty generic and boring to me, to the point where it suggests a lack of creative freedom in regards to how developer Crystal Dynamics was able to use the Marvel license. Considering the number of different looks each character has had over the years, there are some incredibly plain additions here that don’t have fun with the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.There are some interesting skins and nameplates locked behind each character’s “Challenge Card,” which acts like a Battle Pass. These are free for the included six heroes, but future characters’ Challenge Cards will be $10 each. Then there are vendors that you can buy Gear and cosmetic items from, but their prices seem extortionate and I’ve mostly avoided them. Gear vendors are a waste until the very end when you’re more desperate for certain Gear types, while cosmetic vendors just seem to be waiting for whales with money to burn.At the time of writing, a week after launch, the promise of new characters just means an even bigger grind to me. Thanks to Reddit and YouTube, and certainly not the actual game itself, I’ve worked out how to level up quickly. This endgame gameplay loop is unfortunately just a case of replaying the same short missions over and over. Once you’re at the soft cap of 130 Gear score, you’ll then need to use vast amounts of resources earned from missions and dismantling to boost that Gear further. This is all to prepare yourself for content that isn’t out yet.Midway through this grind, I found myself wanting to revisit some of the more linear, story missions and grab some collectibles. I was surprised and saddened to find that you can’t do that. (Collectible hunters will still be able to find missed collectibles in boxes during co-op missions.)Marvel’s Avengers is an identity crisis of a game. Moving from some excellent linear missions that capture Marvel fandom from the point of view of the fantastic Ms. Marvel, to a sudden smattering of seriously generic co-op missions featuring the most boring of enemies defending the most tedious of objectives, made me feel like I was moving between two entirely different games. Throw in the ultimately forgettable story populated by a handful of B-tier named supervillains, and this superhero game quickly descends into monotonous mission grinding for lackluster loot.In another timeline, this would have been a wholly linear experience, tightly paced with a fun narrative that focused entirely on Ms. Marvel’s growth as she sought out the different Avengers in exciting locations, both on Earth and off-world. This could have been complemented with an entirely separate co-op experience.Despite my criticisms, I do feel that there is at least a foundation for something better here. The heroes themselves become much more fun to play as you level them up and you do feel superpowered as you land a bunch of combos. So the combat is solid enough, and if the developer can use post-launch patches and content drops to add a wider variety of multiplayer missions, with more interesting objectives to complete, as well as more enjoyable enemies to fight, and more exciting rewards to earn through less of a grind or offensively high price tags, then I think Marvel’s Avengers has a shot at being a “Games as a Service” title that I’d like to eventually revisit. That seems like a monumental, get-all-six-Infinity-Stones-and-defeat-Thanos size of a task, though.Marvel’s Avengers was reviewed on PS4 Pro with code provided by the publisher.6Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Destructoid,"darkAfter some time with the live version of Marvel’s Avengers, I realized that it had a lot to prove.Now that I’m finished with most of the content that the “1.0” edition has to offer, it still has plenty to prove.Marvel’s Avengers (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Crystal DynamicsPublisher: Square EnixReleased: September 4, 2020MSRP: $59.99So with the character factory that is Marvel, you might be wondering: “who’s in it?” Well, look directly above!Ms. Marvel is the charismatic star that leads back into the light, with Hulk, Iron Man, , Captain America, and Black Widow tagging along for the ride. Kate Bishop and Clint Barton are arriving after launch, with Spider-Man (exclusive to PlayStation) and more to follow. Straight-up, it needed another character at launch: not dangled as free eventual DLC. We’ll talk more about the homogenized cast later.As far as the narrative is concerned, Ms. Marvel does a decent job of trying to carry it on her shoulders with her wide-eyed approach to superheroism, but doesn’t manage to fully hold up all of the baggage involved. The voice acting, to put it mildly, is alright. There are some veteran actors in there, with Edmund Kingsley pulling off a spot-on JARVIS, but several (like the bro-ey Cap) simply do not work or allow you to be drawn into the characters in any meaningful way.The campaign, which is a roughly 10-hour separate component from the Destiny-like live service mode (more on that later too!), is all over the place. It’s a very linear and guided affair, that at times feels held back by the confines of the MCU or Marvel guidelines. No, it’s not directly based on the MCU (MODOK is in it after all), but it’s very clear that Square Enix, like other developers, is leaning hard into the appeal of the blockbuster film franchise.Part of the issue is that it’s almost solely focused on one faction that isn’t all that menacing. The Inhuman saga was always a polarizing aspect of the comics, and it’s front and center here, as are plenty of AIM robots. Putting Ms. Marvel at the focus was a smart move; Sandra Saad’s vocal performance serves as a proxy for the player, as we witness the nuances of each Avenger. Seeing her perspective (including the wonderful Avengers convention intro) is great. Walking in guided tunnels to slowly re-acquire classic comic book characters like currency, not so much.Even at 10+ hours, the campaign is slow-going. It might be ages until you get to play the hero you want, who may or may not actually meet the fantasy of said hero. The drama of the tired “outlawed superhero” angle is just not enough to justify this approach. For as many approval bodies as this likely had to go through at Marvel proper and Disney, it might be the best that Square Enix could do though, given the circumstances.When the game opens up a bit and allows you to embark on sandbox missions, it gets way more fun. There’s more room to screw around and strut your super stuff when you aren’t stopped every minute or so by dialogue or cutscenes that show cool confrontations but don’t actually let you play them outside of sparing QTEs. The Destiny comparison became more apparent the more I played it, as there’s even objectives like “protect the area” with restricted respawns and other action-centric goals tied to loot.Surprisingly, this is really where the game shines for me: where Marvel’s Avengers soars past its aggressively average presentation with the moment-to-moment slugfests. Loading up into a multiplayer mission, any mission, and seeing Hulk leap across your screen from one side while you fly around as Iron Man is a treat. Messy or not, this is some classic Marvel beat ’em up action come to life in the modern era.I don’t use the phrase “arcade-like” lightly, as the combat system could use more refinement. Breaking it down, everyone has a dial-a-combo with light and heavy attacks. Holding down the heavy button usually charges up some sort of smash that breaks shields, but you also have the option of dodging or triggering three specials (one of which is an ultimate ability). It’s very clear that the framework started as an homage to the Arkham Asylum series, but it never really blossomed from there.Heroes have some unique characteristics — especially when you level them up and gain skills — but the combo system for the most part remains constant and is the tie that binds them. Thor can throw his hammer and recall it. Iron Man can hover and shoot repulsor blasts. Hulk can grab people and fling them around. I can see where they were going with everything, as a few specials like Hulk’s Thunderclap look cool and feel true to the comics. But in-between those sessions where you’re beating up things and smiling, it can fall flat when everything you’re fighting is so homogenized.As enemies, AIM robots solve the “problem” of The Avengers straight-up murdering too many humans (you don’t have the “Spider-Man safely webs up all of the baddies after throwing them off a roof” solution here), but AIM never truly feels formidable. Whereas the Ultimate Alliance games weren’t afraid to get weird and throw all sorts of strange oddities at you at all turns, Marvel’s Avengers feels comparatively safe. Even in multiplayer, it can lead to a lot of “have I been here before?” gut feelings.I also dabbled in the endgame and I’m not exactly inspired to keep going. Battle passes, which are doled out for each individual character — free for the starting lineup but $10 for each DLC addition — are slow-going and feel like a grind. There are only a few vendors available in the endgame, and gear (which often lacks personality) and resource acquisition are similarly grindy. Several outfits are outrageously priced and low in quality.When Avengers isn’t getting in the way of itself with its tacked-on campaign, it’s a bit of silly arcade fun. If a lot of these concerns are answered via post-launch patches and the DLC characters are fun to play, there’s plenty of room for improvement with Avengers. At launch, it’s not going to wow everyone. Maybe Marvel wanted this out as soon as possible, but it could have used another delay.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Our Review.Thanks to the MCU, the Avengers have gone from being a really cool comic book team to one of the most beloved properties in the pop culture pantheon. With the rise in prominence of these characters, so have fan expectations risen when it comes to new adaptations. Developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, Marvel’s Avengers looks to take everything that fans love about Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and assemble it into something special. The story in Marvel’s Avengers is entirely new and unique, not deriving from any past films or graphic novels. Centering around Kamala Khan, Avengers superfan, we get an outside look at the beloved superhero team. Visiting the Avengers Helicarrier for A-Day, an event celebrating the opening of the Avengers’ west coast HQ, Kamala gets to meet the heroes that she idolizes dearly. In true comic book fashion, things quickly go awry.  An attack on the city sees several structures destroyed, as well as a large loss of civilian life, including that of a certain hero. During the attack, the Terrigen Crystal is destroyed, spreading an Inhuman infection across the population. Five years later, and the Avengers are now defunct. After being blamed for the tragic events of A-Day, the groups’ activities are outlawed. Many civilians across America have been infected with the Inhuman disease, granting them undesired powers. And the mysterious AIM organization has stepped forward, promising to develop a cure for the Terrigen mist disease.Five years older, we jump back into the life of Kamala Khan. A bit more mature and with some newly acquired powers (thanks to the events of A-Day), Kamala is obsessed with clearing the Avengers name. She goes on a journey to reassemble Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and uncovers some dark secrets along the way. The campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is a terrific adaptation of a beloved property. It’s packed with emotion, drama, and twists, without ever feeling like a ripoff of the MCU or one of many classic comic book runs. One of my greatest concerns going in was that Crystal Dynamics would nervously follow in the footsteps of something we’ve already seen, but they instead tell their own new and unique story.Kamala Khan is what really anchors the narrative in Marvel’s Avengers. Choosing Kamala as a protagonist, rather than Iron Man or Captain America, allows players to experience an Avengers story from a fresh perspective. In the game, Kamala is so filled with hope and determination in a world that’s completely given up on itself, which rings so true to the character. The role is taken to the next level thanks to an excellent performance from Sandra Saad.Kamala’s journey finding and recruiting members of the Avengers is a fun ride. The character interactions feel so accurately portrayed. Many of the Avengers are cold and standoffish to one another, but are considerably kinder and more understanding of Kamala. Working to clear the Avengers’ name while also discovering the truth behind the events of A-Day makes for a worthy addition to a long list of Avengers stories.The combat in Marvel’s Avengers feels like a highly-polished brawler. I often found myself spamming attacks and plunging into crowds of enemies and just wrecking shop. This would be a pretty standard, serviceable combat system, but the heroes themselves is what takes it above and beyond. Just like the story accurately adapts and represents the personalities of the Avengers, the combat is pinpoint accurate in depicting each of their independent fighting styles. Fighting 20 enemies as the Hulk is entirely different than battling the same group as Black Widow. Hulk can pick up enemies and repeatedly slam them into the ground, or use them as projectiles to stun and damage others. Black Widow, on the other hand, lights things up with dual-wielded pistols, able to quickly jump in and out of the action with her grappling hook.A personal favorite of mine was Thor. Swinging Mjölnir around and nailing enemies feels weighted, and incredibly satisfying. Thor also has the ability to throw and recall Mjölnir as he pleases. The combat in Marvel’s Avengers is able to work because each hero feels uniquely defined, with their own independent skills and abilities. Once the campaign is complete, players are urged to take their skills online and battle alongside others. Titled “Avengers Initiative,” this is where Marvel’s Avengers is meant to live on as a live service. Players can engage in a variety of missions that range in difficulty, rewarding the player with gear that they can equip and upgrade their heroes with. While the mode is alright in its current state, there is some work to do in order to make Avengers Initiative a must-play experience. Upon completing missions in both the campaign and multiplayer modes, players will receive gear that they can equip to their heroes. Gear provides statistical bonuses to attack and defense as well as other specific traits, such as increased damage for signature attacks. Gear comes in six qualities: common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and exotic. A character’s gear loadout will increase their power level, allowing them to properly take on tougher missions.The process of completing missions, earning gear, and leveling up is a satisfying gameplay loop, but it lacks that wow-factor of the campaign and combat. The UI feels extremely convoluted, with a seemingly countless number of menus and submenus to dig through. You’ll often realize that you’ve got gear that you didn’t know about, because it's over in an entirely different inventory menu because your current slots are filled. Or, that you haven’t upgraded your ultimate ability because you’ve got to flip through pages to find that skill tree. There’s a solid, much easier to understand experience in there, but it feels like Crystal Dynamics isn’t quite there yet.I also experienced issues trying to queue into matches and play with friends, as we would freeze standing around the War Table, or the game would tell players that a character is locked, that isn’t. Luckily for Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics, most of my issues with Avengers Initiative are entirely fixable. Once you’re actually in a mission, working alongside friends, you see the charm of Marvel’s Avengers’ multiplayer. Charging into a massive wave of enemies and dealing some damage as a unit just feels epic. It’s the exact level of over-the-top action that you want from an Avengers game. I did experience some framerate drops when playing on PS4, but luckily nothing that made the game feel unplayable. What really impressed me when playing online was the way that you can organically combine the unique abilities of a character with other heroes to work together. For example, when playing as Thor, I threw Mjölnir at an enemy flying around in a jetpack. He was immediately slammed to the ground, unable to move from beneath the godly hammer. My friend, who was playing as Captain America ran over and began to attack the defenseless enemy with his shield, making for an easy kill. When playing as Iron Man, you can call down the iconic Hulkbuster suit. However, Iron Man doesn’t necessarily have to be the one to enter the suit. In one instance, Iron Man called down the suit, and the Hulk jumped into the Hulkbuster, letting him take advantage of all the suit’s bonuses. It’s moments like these that will sell you the multiplayer in Marvel’s Avengers, as it did with me.Marvel’s Avengers impresses with a well-written, dramatic campaign. From a gameplay standpoint, the combat is as fun and satisfying as one could hope for in a title based on the superhero team. Though the online live service aspect is bogged down by overly complicated menus, systems, and matchmaking woes, there’s still a fun experience underneath. Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix deliver a perfectly adequate adaptation of an iconic property with Marvel’s Avengers.This review is based on a digital download code provided by the publisher.
