Link Official siteWhile I've never been a big superhero girlie, I've always had a soft spot for Miles Morales. He's my preferred Spider-Man—I find him a more interesting and personable character than Peter Parker's various iterations.That feeling extends to their respective games. Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a great mini sequel-slash-spinoff to Insomniac's 2018 web-slinging endeavour. In Rick Lane's Spider-Man review, he wrote that it was a mostly good port of a mostly good game. The bad news is Miles Morales's PC port is still just ""mostly good."" The good news is it's one of a far better game.Miles Morales is a more streamlined experience than its predecessor. There may be less to do, but almost all of it is in a way that benefits Miles and New York. Much of the bloat has been cut—there are fewer sidequests to distract and the story is far shorter than its predecessor. It's a perfect opportunity for a tighter, more intense storyline, and Miles Morales delivers.Things kick off with a quick recap, getting me up to speed on where Miles is at now. The narrative's focus splits between the teen balancing his family life—particularly in the wake of his father's death in the previous game—and performing his new spidey duties while the OG takes a cheeky winter vacay. Routine web-slinging shenanigans lead Miles to some serious beef between Roxxon Corporation and the Underground, a high-tech criminal gang led by the Tinkerer. It's got its fair share of superhero-level predictability in its various twists and turns. But the game does a great job of fleshing out its cast, giving those predictable moments an emotional charge that affords some forgiveness.A more engaging story is undoubtedly aided by the fact Insomniac has somehow managed to make being Spider-Man feel even cooler than it was before. It may be a snow-covered replica of Peter Parker's New York, but the developer has tweaked its near-perfect web-slinging to feel even more satisfying. I feel more in control of wallrunning and steering around buildings this time around. I defaulted to traversal via controller, but gave keyboard a shout and found port developer Nixxes has translated the inputs over surprisingly well. It took a bit of getting used to but eventually felt just as intuitive as using a Dualsense.Beating on bad guys is mostly the same between both Spideys, but Miles gets a few key additions that differentiate him. His Venom abilities shake up the combat a bit, allowing Miles to deal some burst electrical damage to enemies. The hits feel weighty and have some nice, snappy camera work to make the fights feel more dynamic. By and large though, the core moveset remains the same. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but those looking for drastic combat evolutions may feel disappointed.There's still an overabundance of stealth missions, requiring Miles to delicately balance on poles and beams while quietly webbing up enemies out of sight. They've never been my favourite, and I usually end up tired of repeatedly scanning each enemy to see if they're safe for a stealth takedown. Numerous times I gave up and threw myself into the fray, finding slamming down an entire group of Underground goons with my Venom Smash far more pleasing.""Insomniac has somehow managed to make being Spider-Man feel even cooler than it was before.""With Miles Morales zipping over to PC from the PlayStation 5, the game's already a graphical feast. For the most part, the port looks equally gorgeous, if not better. I did experience some aliasing issues, particularly during cutscenes. There were also a few graphical bugs throughout my few hours in New York, like textures not loading in properly and Miles missing altogether during loading screens, leaving some stray gappy web behind.I also had an absolute mare with frame drops and crashing. My rig didn't get on with the ray-tracing options too well, and even when switched off I found some pesky framerate issues during combat and traversal. It also crashed on me several times which, thanks to auto-saving, isn't a huge issue for the gameplay side of things. But having to boot the game up multiple times in one night began to become a tad frustrating. On the plus side, there are tons of graphical options to tinker around with. Knocking down traffic density and disabling ray tracing let me play on high settings with relatively few hiccups, bar the crashing problem.I still recommend playing Insomniac's first Spider-Man, purely because it compliments the strength of this game's story. But for those who just want to kick it around a wintry New York, sling past skyscrapers at breakneck speed, and kick bad-guy butt, Miles Morales should be your one true Spider-Man. It's easily the hero's best adventure to date, and it won't eat up a ton of your time either.An excellent evolution of its predecessor that, while carrying over some of its weaknesses, has further strengthened its high points.Mollie spent her early childhood deeply invested in games like Killer Instinct, Toontown and Audition Online, which continue to form the pillars of her personality today.

Eurogamer,"Amazing.If Astro's Playroom presents a look at some of the more novel appeals of the PlayStation 5, Miles Morales is a decent example of another draw of the new generation - it's about taking a game you know well and making it look better, run smoother and get you into the action as quick as you can load up a blockbuster movie on Netflix. It's about presenting a more seamless brand of entertainment, and if you want a breezy thrill there are few better candidates than Insomniac's take on Spider-Man.2018's Marvel's Spider-Man was a truly lovely thing, a superhero game that felt refreshingly different. Yes, it cribbed much of the fundamentals from the Arkham series, but just as Rocksteady's devotion to the Dark Knight lent those games a giddy edge, here Insomniac's affection for a different flavour of comic book classic shone through. A lightness of touch and a certain goofiness embodied Spider-Man's charm - here was something earnest and optimistic rather than dark and brooding. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales inherits all that - rather than a full-on sequel this is an expansion that's, well, expansive, with a run-time not too much shorter than the original - and adds a little more besides. Having nailed so many of the fundamentals last time round, Insomniac has been afforded the opportunity to build upon the original in ways that further explore the character of Spider-Man. And it really helps that the person under the mask is Miles Morales. Set a year after the original game, here we're seeing Miles take on the role under the tutelage of Peter Parker. Gangly and nervous - with a charming abundance of earnestness - Morales is an endearing student, and it's a joy to re-learn Spider-Man's systems through him (if you've not played the original, it makes this a seamless entry point to the story). Nadji Jeter's voice performance is pitch perfect, helped by an in-game realisation that nails the affable awkwardness of the character. The real pleasure, though, is seeing how Insomniac explores that character elsewhere in the game. The outstanding traversal of the original returns, but Miles gives it a whole new rhythm - stuttering and occasionally staccato as he stumbles out of the sky, through his clumsy arcs you can tell he's someone still learning the ropes. (Into the Spider-Verse's graceful animation appears to be an inspiration, and Insomniac is gracious enough to include a nod with an excellent easter egg - one of dozens of nerdy easter eggs in the game.) For returning players it's a neat little refresh of the original swinging, and elevates what was already one of the best open-world traversal systems around. There's a silkiness to it all that's just sublime, an effortlessness in the way you glide from rooftop to rooftop, and it's always engaging. Of course on PlayStation 5 that's improved when you can switch over to performance mode and play at 60fps (for more on the technical side of Miles Morales on PlayStation 5, check out Digital Foundry's in-depth report), but even when you halve the frame-rate it feels smoother than so much else out there: yes, it's an open world game where much of your time is spent scooting from one point to another, but when the simple act of motion is so intoxicating, it's never a chore. New York's got a makeover too, a fresh set of distractions and side missions laid atop a Manhattan that's dizzyingly detailed. Once again, it's the seamlessness of the action that really impresses here - as it was with the original, and obviously further enhanced when playing on a PlayStation 5 with the snappiness that its fast storage brings. There's a flow to Insomniac's brand of action, as you leap from building to building straight into combat then back out again, that's irresistible. Nowhere better is that flow displayed than in the combat - another area where we see Morales' different traits being explored. His unique abilities - a camouflage that renders him invisible and venom powers that charge through him like electricity - are layered on top of the original's lithe moveset, giving you a slightly broader palette to choose from. Stealth has some of the sting taken out of it, while Miles' burgeoning venom powers also give you a new tech tree to explore, unlocking new abilities by picking up activity tokens and tech parts squirrelled around the map. Guiding Miles from nervous apprentice to noble superhero is a tangible thing; by the game's climax you'll have seen him evolve into a brawler who can set the screen alight with his array of electricity-infused attacks, and who can soar through Manhattan's streets with an almighty leap. That journey's mirrored in a story that's inclusive, warm-hearted and optimistic - an absolute hug of a thing. Perhaps that's where Miles stands apart from Peter Parker for me - his spider sense might not be as strong as Parker's, but his sense of family feels stronger, something reflected in the extended cast here. Rio Morales brings maternal warmth, while the adorable nerd Ganke Lee is the perfect sidekick and voice in your ear through the campaign. There are other members of Miles Morales' world that... Well, I'll leave all that for you to explore. The stakes are certainly set a touch lower than last time, and the story runs out of ideas a little too quickly while the threads left dangling after the last game are left almost entirely untouched, but the finale is thrilling - and Insomniac's clearly only just getting started on a series that looks set to be Sony's centrepiece over the coming years. It's a little lumpy in places - as stuffed open-world games like this are wont to be - with a glitch or two more than I'd have liked (and while I don't have first-hand experience of the PlayStation 4 version, others here have and reported that some of there are a few more glitches present there). This is also certainly a thing of thrift rather than something entirely fresh, a retread of the original that, to its credit, knows exactly what needed nipping and what needed tucking. Given the trying global circumstances this was made under, I think that's more than okay. And given the circumstances that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales releases into, it's heartening to have a tale that's so eager to see the best in everyone, and that strives for diversity in a world divided. In that way, Spider-Man: Miles Morales' message of hope feels like the right sentiment for this very moment. It's escapism with a social conscience, a timely, tremendous thing right now. Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original, but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.

Fantastic superhero playgroundCharismatic lead Satisfying combat and web-swingingA very brief experienceOnly one mission threadWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.I'm slightly conflicted with Miles Morales' PS5 debut. It is great, looks incredible and packs in a satisfying story in its short time - but it is brief, to the point where placing it front and center of the PS5 launch lineup feels a little... dishonest. For all the visual spectacle and genuine joy of seeing Miles step up as a character, there's no getting away from the fact that you'll likely see the credits roll before your other launch games have finished downloading. There's nothing wrong with that, obviously - I'm all for short games - just be prepared to see the main campaign through in a couple of evenings. It's a little longer, obviously, if you take on more side activities but, nonetheless, there's days of content here at best, not weeks. And, while Sony did align it with other standalone expansions like The Last of Us' Left Behind and Uncharted's Lost Legacy, this has a much more DLC feel in comparison; an extension of the original game, rather than a companion.   It is good though, let me make that clear, as well as a great demonstration of what the PS5 can do. Even before the action starts, the intro - with Miles on a subway - introduces the new DualSense haptics with a 'holy shit that actually feels like a train!' moment. Throughout the game the pad physically pops and crackles with Miles' electrical Venom abilities, and recreates many recognizable sensations through some sort of vibrational voodoo. The load times, or lack of, are also amazing. Whether you fast travel across the map, or leave an interior to go outside, it's instantaneous, with the only noticeable delay being the second or two it takes to start from the PS5 menu. It also looks incredible, recreating a snowy New York at a near photorealistic level. There are moments in the latter half of the game, when gentle flurries set in and distant buildings fade into the weather, where the only thing that gives it away as a game is the little guy swinging past in an onesie.  That little guy, Miles, is a great character too: he's naive but keen, desperate to live up to his title but plagued with self-doubt and questions. He's already got his abilities but he's still learning the ropes, while feeling his way both as a young adult and a new superhero. The recent death of his father is just as life-changing as his new Spider-life and there's a great 'story so far' recap at the start that reframes the original 2018 game entirely from Miles' perspective - the focus obviously heavily on his loss, with Pete's story as a sidebar that leads into how he became a new Spider-Man. Throughout, the focus is on the human part of 'superhuman'. The original game did a good job of using Peter's relationships to add some heart and emotional weight when the story needed it. Here it is all about a kid dealing with his life, of which superheroing is just a part. The opening places a firm emphasis on community and family, making his responsibilities, relationships and hopes outside of Spider-Man clear - the latter just one more thing he has to deal with. It does a great job of conveying the pressures of youth: that inexperienced overload from experiencing everything for the first time and feeling like it has to all be dealt now or it's a disaster. Being young can be a lot to take in at the best of times and this somehow channels that in a believable way, even if it is about a kid from Brooklyn who can stick to walls. Full credit to actor Nadji Jeter here, who provided the voice, face and mocap, who's excellent as Miles, creating a character full of enthusiasm and charm as he navigates his hopes and fears for the future. Miles' life as a superhero plays out in a similar way to Peter Parker's, with a city to protect and crimes to fight. Again, like the last game, there's just an exhilarating freedom to being let loose with those powers. Diving from a skyscraper to swing at the last possible minute as street sounds rush up to meet you never gets old. Even here Miles' character comes through, with lovely animations as he occasionally flails through the air or overbalances as he lands, showing how new he still is to everything. Combat is the only mechanic that's really overhauled, with Miles' new Venom powers letting him unleash splashy area-of-effect ground pounds, or distance covering crackling dashes that can launch enemies into the air. There's a rhythm that builds around charging and unleashing the ability to maximum effect. It's also tactical, with opponents using equipment that can only be disabled or destroyed by Venom attacks. The new ability to turn invisible is fun as well, but feels under-explored in a game with an already heavy stealth emphasis. You spend much of your time unseen as it is, hopping between high spots searching out takedowns, so the idea of stealth camo never really feels meaningfully utilized as a mechanic.As enjoyable and satisfying as the combat is, it also underlines how short the game is. The skill tree is light and lacks any real game-changing upgrades while there are only four gadgets. They're all fun and functional but never capture the improvisational magic of things like the last game's trip mines or web bombs. The brevity of the story also means it sometimes feels like you're unlocking things faster than your ability to master the combinations and options. Even chasing street crimes and side challenges I don't think I really got a complete feel for some abilities and interplays until almost the end, as there isn't enough to practice with unless you rerun repeatable objectives. There aren't really any side mission threads either. There's one main storyline, some enemy bases to clear out, things to collect, repeating street crimes and slightly structured one-off events like knocking ice off a crane to stop it falling or finding a stolen car. There are a few side missions but they're mostly single hits unlocked by story progress - not because they're related to what's happening but more to space things out and make them last until the end. The main story does at least make what time it has count and it's impressive just how much it packs a full-size game feel into a barely double-digit run time. There are some good set pieces and even better narrative moments. One of my early concerns was that everything was moving too fast for you to really care much for the characters, but it pulls it off. When the game wants you to really feel something, it hits all the right buttons and I was genuinely affected by the ending on more than one level. There's also a moment that is very clearly trying to be PlayStation's version of the 'Leap of faith' from Into the Spider-Verse. It's not quite as good, but nails that 'hell yeah! surge of excitement of when the music and the mood comes together perfectly. It also ends its crescendo with you seamlessly in control, soaring above the city still buzzing from the build-up.Overall it's been a weird one to review. I really enjoyed it, but the brevity feels like something to warn you about given that this is presented as a launch title. Even if you were expecting a small 'full' game, this is smaller. It plays like great DLC, because it is great and also clearly DLC, rather than a stand-alone expansion. Things like Left Behind and Lost Legacy worked because they were linear and gave the developer precise control over the pace and punch of a single story lasting a few hours. Here you've got a great story but one that takes place in a huge open world with little else overly meaningful to fill it. The story, characters, and action are all enjoyable, but if you unboxed your shiny new PS5 on Friday night and settled in to play this over the weekend, you'd likely reach the 'hoovering up collectibles because it's all that's left' stage before Monday came around.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"The biggest PS5 launch game stars a brand new Spider-Man and some impressive next gen visuals but is it as good as the original?We weren’t really looking forward to playing this game. It may be the highest profile PlayStation 5 launch title, but we didn’t like the first one nearly as much as some people and found the shady way in which Sony slowly revealed that this isn’t a full-blown sequel, and sowed confusion over the PlayStation 4 version and Ultimate Edition, very distasteful. But surprise! It’s actually a fantastic launch game: an effective demonstration of the PlayStation 5’s capabilities and a tighter, more focused gameplay experience with considerably better storytelling than the original.As was eventually made plain, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is not Spider-Man 2. It does take place after the events of the first game but it’s only around eight hours long and casts you as Miles Morales rather than the older Peter Parker – who spends the majority of the game on a working holiday in Europe.We’re not very familiar with Miles from the comics, so we’re not sure if the game is adapting existing story elements, but the plot revolves around a feud between the obviously evil CEO of energy company Roxxon and a new female incarnation of the Tinkerer – who has a small army’s worth of followers and is desperate to steel Roxxon’s new, and predictably unstable, wonder-fuel.Although it’s a neat coming of age story there’s nothing exceptional about the plot, and in truth Miles himself is not particularly interesting either. Although this game is much better at portraying him as a neighbourhood Spider-Man, with a real feeling of community to his Harlem home.Like Peter Parker, Miles’ friend Ganke, and several others in the game, Miles is portrayed as incorruptibly virtuous, which is how we prefer our superheroes but it’s a difficult thing to get right without making the characters seem incredibly bland. Several movies have managed the trick, but the Spider-Man games have not.Instead, what makes this game interesting is the identity of the Tinkerer, which creates a far more compelling relationship between hero and villain than anything in the first game. There’s also a second character, who we won’t name, who’s equally engaging given his moral ambiguity and his existing relationship with Miles. The last few hours in particular are hugely compelling and conclude with one of the best endings to any game this/last generation (we’re not quite sure how to aim that compliment).If you’ve played the original – or indeed any Spider-Man game or Batman: Arkham – you know what you’re getting here in terms of gameplay, with the web-swinging being largely unchanged since last time. Miles himself does have some extra abilities that Peter Parker doesn’t though. We’re not quite sure why (or why he doesn’t have a separate superhero name) but in addition to web-shooting he also generates a bioelectric charge that can be released as a ‘Venom Punch’, as well as the ability to briefly turn invisible.You’d think this would completely unbalance the combat but the venom-related moves all rely on you building up energy by landing or avoiding blows, which adds an appreciable amount of extra depth to the combat, especially as you still have to cope with enemies with shields, various different weapons, and venom-dampening equipment. It’s not quite Devil May Cry but it’s getting there, even if the foundation is still very obviously based on the Batman: Arkham games.The stealth sections, which are so similar to the Predator sections in the Arkham games it seems almost criminal, were always too easy though and they’re even more so now thanks to being able to turn invisible. On the default difficulty the game is too easy in general, but the stealth gets old very quickly when you’re just dealing with cannon fodder grunts.There’s various unlockable moves and gadgets as you progress, but there’s also not enough variety in the enemies to keep you interested in the combat if it isn’t also mixed in with puzzle solving or story elements (which, to be fair, it often is). There’s surprisingly few boss battles though, with only one straight-up supervillain. But that’s fine, as the encounters which are included are all memorable and there’s less reliance on QTEs than the first game.Another reason we weren’t really looking forward to this game is that we knew that it was using largely the same map and gameplay as the original game. That is the case but it’s actually a bit of a masterstroke, as simply by virtue of all the skyscrapers using ray-tracing, so that they reflect everything else nearby, the game gains exactly the sort of, ‘Look! This is next gen!’ moment that we criticised the Xbox Series X for lacking.The reflection effect is fairly low resolution, but it completely transforms some areas and can also be seen in everything from puddles to reflective floors. There’s also the near instant loading to marvel at, which means that death is never more than a two second inconvenience, and while the DualSense adaptive triggers and force feedback aren’t used as much as Astro’s Playroom there’s still some neat effects, such as the rumbling of a subway train.It’s unfortunate though that you have to choose between either having ray-tracing and all the trimmings at 30fps or 60fps with no ray-tracing and only upscaled 4K. We’re still disappointed that neither next gen console can manage both at the same time but given this is a launch game that reuses so many last gen assets this is still a surprisingly impressive technical showcase.Things like facial animation still look very last gen, even if they are good by those standards, but what impresses the most is just how slick and confident the game is with its presentation. It’s full of little cinematic flourishes, and great use of non-orchestral music, without ever indulging in overly long cut scenes – just effective mood setters that don’t spoil the pacing.Eight or so hours might not sound like much but considering how drawn-out the original was we were absolutely fine with the running time. The story fits the length of the game perfectly and there is a significant amount of optional side quests, some of which are so long we kept forgetting they weren’t story missions. There’s also a substantial New Game+ which is the only way to unlock some special abilities.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepIt’s not been an epidemic, but one unwelcome trend of the current generation is that many single-player games have become very bloated and over-long in their attempts to justify their asking price, often obscuring the story they’re trying to tell. As far as we’re concerned Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the perfect way to avoid such problems, with its lower than normal price tag (compared to other first party PlayStation 5 games) and much more manageable running time.We doubt it’s intended to have that kind of influence – its length is almost certainly just a case of making sure it was ready for launch – but we really hope that Sony and others recognise the much more sustainable template it lays out. But they probably won’t and Spider-Man 2 will end up being another 20 to 30 hour epic that doesn’t know to quit while it’s ahead.That’s not a problem Spider-Man: Miles Morales suffers from though and this is not only one of the most satisfying story experiences we’ve had in an action game all year but a highly encouraging glimpse at the future of PlayStation 5 games, and next gen gaming in general.In Short: A far better advert for the PS5 than its short length and last gen assets might have suggested, with superior storytelling and more compelling characters than the original.Pros: Highly assured storytelling and presentation, with a great villain and spectacular final act. Ray-tracing works very well amongst the skyscrapers, as does fast-loading and other next gen tricks.Cons: The combat and stealth elements remain very repetitive and overly easy. The amount the game steals from Batman: Arkham is still outrageous.Score: 8/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed) and PlayStation 4Price: £49.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: Insomniac GamesRelease Date: 12th November 2020Age Rating: 16Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Game Informer,"Electricity surges through Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, delivering a powerful charge to the web-slinging action, and a warmth to the family-focused story. Even though this sequel runs at roughly half the length of Peter Parker’s 2018 adventure, it is consistently engaging and powerful, only coming up short in the impact the villains have on the entire experience.
 
Miles is Peter’s understudy, and while he’s just learning what it means to be a hero, he embraces the opportunity and stands tall on his own. His actions are not as refined as Peter’s, but he spins a more complex web on the battlefield, intertwining fisticuffs and stealth in glorious ways to decimate his foes. Miles is brilliantly brought to life by actor Nadji Jeter, who gives him an innocence that anchors most scenes and makes him a character you can root for. Miles is just getting to know his new home of Harlem, a beautifully realized location with a wide variety of cultures, languages, and festive holiday decorations to soak in.By having Miles’ first days as Spider-Man unfold offscreen through the first game’s DLC, Insomniac sidesteps some of the awkward growing pains of a new hero. From the moment you take control of him, he feels like a skilled Spider-Man; he swings dangerously across crowded city streets, shoots webbing to stop speeding cars, and uses his spider sense to slip through streams of bullets. In these opening moments, Miles’ moveset feels a bit like a carbon copy of Peter’s, but that changes quickly once he gains access to his new powers.Miles is differentiated from his mentor in two huge ways. The biggest is his ability to camouflage and disappear completely from the sight. This technique not only makes stealth easier and more satisfying, it also creates the opportunity to reset encounters. Enemies can lose sight of Miles and return to their patterns, so you can try picking them off silently again. This reduces some of the difficulty, but camo augments these conflicts nicely, and also makes Miles feel like an entirely different kind of hero than Peter.His second unique power is called Venom, which he can use to electrify punches, dashes, and jumps. The Venom maneuvers are incredibly fun to use, and push you to think differently during combat, as you’re always looking to clump enemies together so the Venom’s electrical jolt immobilizes numerous targets at once. Insomniac also zooms the camera in to give these devastating strikes a more satisfying wallop, but this also creates the problem of the player’s vision being more limited, which causes some issues with enemies recognition. The tighter view is not a huge setback, but I felt like I had better visibility and awareness while controlling Peter in the first game.Additionally, combat scenarios never escalate to the crazy levels that Peter had to deal with. You won’t see any aerial units or truly massive waves of enemies. Most encounters end quickly, yet are always exciting, and are nicely sewn into missions. The open-world activities are better designed this time around, with a strong focus on limiting repetition. You don’t have to engage many crimes at all, and just need to complete the missions and find all collectibles to reach 100-percent completion. Having all nearby activities on the handy phone app designed by Miles’ friend Ganke Lee also helps streamline the process, reducing your need to spend time on the menu screen. You still need to go there for the meaningful skill tree upgrades upon leveling up and to purchase new mods for your suits, but the focus is now more on pure gameplay, which is great.As you explore the open world, Miles’ bio-electrical abilities also enhance his web-swinging. A burst of Venom sends him higher into the air or into a quick dash, and both add a bit more superhero might to exploration. Using these abilities pushes the player to do aerial tricks to fill their Venom meter, which again makes your time in the air more active and all the more fun.Everything you do branches beautifully off of the central narrative arc, which focuses intimately on Miles and his family. The slower moments are easily the game’s best, some are even delivered as fun musical montages. Insomniac put a lot of heart and care into these sequences, and they go a long way in making the big reveals and dramatic moments click.All of the story-focused missions and side activities are nicely designed, and often lead to great set-piece moments (the introductory Rhino battle is jaw-droppingly awesome) and rewarding payoffs along the lines of new suits or additional activities coming online.I thoroughly enjoyed how Miles’ story unfolds, but it hangs its mask on some clichéd coming-of-age hooks; outside of his personal and familial turmoil, he doesn’t face much of a defined threat. Roxxon is billed as the evil presence, but you won’t see many villains at all – a huge change of pace from the first game. Rhino is the most pronounced, and he’s the first one you see. Some others are teased, but they never materialize into anything other than cameos. Roxxon and The Underground fall a bit flat, but the emotional strings they link to Miles pay off in satisfying ways.For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.The PlayStation 5 DifferenceNo load times. Beautiful raytracing. The PlayStation 5 version of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a technical juggernaut that continually impresses. It is the ideal way to play the game if you can. Feeling the Venom flow through the controller is quite cool. That’s not to say the PlayStation 4 version is far behind, however. Marvel’s Spider-Man from 2018 remains one of the generation’s best-looking and playing games, and this game’s performance is in lockstep with it. Fast travel and restarts bring up short subway rides and loading screens (they are instant on PS5), and the visuals may not have that next-gen sheen, but the PS4 version is still a beautiful and worthy way to experience this excellent game.

   on November 18, 2022 at 9:43AM PSTEditor's note: Spider-Man: Miles Morales is releasing on November 12 for both PS5 and PS4. For this review, Jordan played on a PS4 Pro. Other GameSpot staff tested the game on PS5 and found it to be a largely comparable experience, with the PS5 version benefiting from improved visual flourishes and load times. For a technical-focused discussion of the PS5, and how Miles Morales benefits, check out our PS5 review. This review has also been updated by Alessandro Barbosa to reflect our experiences on PC.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales feels like the second half to The City That Never Sleeps, a three-part follow-up expansion to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man--the game even begins with the option to watch a short recap of the first game and its DLC in order to bring you up to speed on Miles' origins, reinforcing the notion that this is an extension of what's come before.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Video ReviewAnd, unfortunately, the gameplay in Spider-Man: Miles Morales (which I will hereafter refer to as SM:MM because I'll be damned if I try to write a full review that cleverly tries to make a distinction between Spider-Man/Miles Morales the game and Spider-Man/Miles Morales the character; I won't do it) never quite manages to break free of that feeling. That isn't necessarily a bad thing--I like 2018's Spider-Man for its engaging combat loop, so I'm glad SM:MM emulates it. It's just that sometimes SM:MM can feel too similar to what's come before, which can get in the way of establishing Miles as his own brand of superhero. Regardless, the familiar trappings of SM:MM are used to tell an entirely fresh story with a few brand-new faces. And it's that narrative and those characters that manage to distinguish SM:MM as an open-world action game that's compelling to play.Like its predecessor, SM:MM throws you right into the action. After a short intro, Miles suits up and joins Peter Parker in escorting a convoy transporting supervillain Rhino, who's being taken back to prison after his escape in the previous game. Things don't go according to plan, but Miles manages to step up in a big way during the mission, proving to his mentor that he's capable of watching over New York City on his own for two weeks while Peter goes on a vacation with Mary Jane.I love this opening. There's a frantic pace to it; the game tosses you straight into its combat and traversal mechanics, immediately having you fight some escaped convicts before sticking you to the back of a rampaging Rhino. You need to steer the hulking brute around obstacles and pedestrians in a crowded shopping mall, and then you're flung into the open world to chase after the villain through the twists and turns of the city streets. And that's just the first 10 minutes. So even though the first few mechanics you learn are fairly straightforward--despite his inexperience, Miles controls just like Peter in the first game so web-slinging is practically effortless and combat isn't much harder--the sheer whiplash of needing to constantly adapt to different types of gameplay in such a short time puts you right into Miles' headspace. You can complete the level in one go because it's the prologue and it's easy, but it feels like Miles is just getting by and that Peter is doing most of the work anyway (he even covers for you when you make a mistake, like missing a quick-time prompt).In moderation, I think this would have been a great way to convey to the player how stressful Miles' newfound responsibility is. But SM:MM never lets up. It's high-key set piece after high-key set piece for most of its 11-hour runtime, with very little time reserved for quiet moments of reflection. Miles acquires a series of gadgets and abilities at a fairly steady pace as well (including his trademark venom sting and camouflage superpowers, which I'll get to in a bit), several of which emerge in unsatisfying ways as seemingly random bouts of deus ex machina. At times, it can feel like SM:MM is almost rushing towards its conclusion, desperate to deliver on the promise that Miles ends the game as a seasoned Spider-Man without really slowing down to show you how he manages to earn the respect and appreciation of a city that already knows and loves a Spider-Man.The main plot of SM:MM sees Miles simultaneously try to garner the favor of New York by fulfilling requests left by random New Yorkers on a smartphone app and stop the escalating conflict between Roxxon Energy Corporation and a gang called the Underground. Roxxon is buying up bits and pieces of Harlem to make room for reactors that will run on a brand-new energy source. Meanwhile, the Underground want to make a name for themselves, and thanks to the advanced arsenal of weapons they now have thanks to their new boss, the Tinkerer, the gang is setting its sights on destroying the prominent Roxxon.The story is your standard superhero affair with betrayals and ramifications that are familiar to the genre but still exciting to watch unfold. If anything, it's the characters who manage to keep SM:MM from feeling formulaic--the Tinkerer, especially. It's difficult to hype up how good of a villain they are without spoiling the best moments from SM:MM's campaign outright. When pressed, I've just been telling people that SM:MM does for the Tinkerer what the movie Spider-Man: Homecoming does for the Vulture. The game humanizes a classic but somewhat bland member of Spidey's rogues' gallery and gives them a compelling reason for why they turned to a life of crime, reinventing the character into more of a tragic figure. In a certain light, the Tinkerer's actions could be construed to be almost heroic (in an anti-hero sort of way), allowing the character to exist as a dark foil to Miles' Spider-Man. And at the center of that comparison between Miles and the Tinkerer is the two's shared life experiences.Prior to Miles' regular interactions with the Tinkerer, his evolution as a hero is primarily seen through his closest friends and confidants. Miles is surrounded by heroes, so a small but significant part of SM:MM is his musings about who he should be taking inspiration from. His friends serve as two sides of a coin, playing the roles of angels and devils in the debates that will define Miles. Ganke, for example, knows that Miles is Spider-Man and understands what Miles wants to get out of the role, but can't really empathize with Miles' Black or Puerto Rican heritage. Other friends and allies, however, more closely relate to Miles' cultural identities and struggles but don't understand the extent of his secret identity. Miles regularly talks to key members of the supporting cast throughout the first half of the campaign, and you get to see him coming to an understanding of what type of hero he wants to be through these conversations. It's awesome, and so when he dons his traditional black-and-red suit and emerges as a brand-new Spider-Man for the first time, one similar to but also altogether different from Peter Parker's Spider-Man, you can understand how he's grown to this point. You got to see it; you got to live through that internal turmoil with him.The child of a Black father and Puerto Rican mother, Miles is a wonderful mixture of cultures and languages. His building is adorned with the Puerto Rican flag, his family has an old collection of jazz and R&B vinyl records, and he seamlessly transitions between standard English, African-American Vernacular English, Spanish, and American Sign Language based on who he's talking to (occasionally even mixing together one or two of them). The way he leaps off of rooftops and flips backwards to face the camera before falling into a headfirst dive is just full of the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen--it gives me goosebumps every time he does it, especially as the music begins to swell.Speaking of, we've got to talk about the music in SM:MM. When Miles begins swinging, the orchestral score grows louder, but there's a nice synthetic hip-hop undercurrent to the whole thing. The music isn't as bombastic as that heard in 2018's Spider-Man. It instead crackles with a soft percussion--it reverberates in your ears with a steady crescendo that stops just short of overtaking the sounds of the city. It allows Miles (and to an extent, the player) to remain clued into New York even while soaring through the air at breakneck speeds to the sound of bomb-ass beats. I also need to shoutout SM:MM's use of Jaden Smith and Kid Cudi's ""On My Own,"" which is used perfectly in an introductory scene--it fits as well into the game as Post Malone and Swae Lee's ""Sunflower"" did in the movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Unfortunately, SM:MM can't slow down enough for you to really immerse yourself in the music that plays in the open world. If Ganke isn't calling to direct Miles to his next objective, then it's Miles' mother checking in or his uncle offering some advice or J. Jonah Jameson ranting about the new web-swinging menace or someone else. The game is constantly cutting off the music to deliver a new waypoint for you to follow or a conversation to listen to before the new waypoint appears. And thankfully, you can turn some of these voices off, but many are tied to the story--so you'll have someone almost always yapping in your ear. I'm enjoying traversal in the game far more now having finished the campaign, as I can just appreciate the rhythmic beat of the music while marveling at the beautiful murals, busy parks, and other aspects of New York culture that are on display in Harlem.The game does look better on PS5, but the difference isn't drastic enough to fundamentally change the experience.Speaking of, outside of Harlem (which has gotten a little bit of extra aesthetic love in order to better capture the culture of the area), SM:MM's New York is largely the same as the one in 2018's Spider-Man; the city is now just covered in snow and holiday decorations. I played the game on PS4 Pro and found SM:MM's graphics to look a lot like 2018's Spider-Man. A few of my coworkers have played SM:MM on PS5 and report that the game does look better on next-gen, but the difference isn't drastic enough to fundamentally change the experience--the game is sharper, reflections of characters in windows are far more clear, and load times are faster. The technical features provided by PS5's DualSense controller don't add anything essential to the gameplay either; there's trigger resistance to represent the effort Miles need to put in to shooting webs when soaring through the air, and subtle vibrations in the controller for whenever a phone vibrates or a train moves along a track. They're cool bells and whistles, but you're getting a similar experience whether you're playing on PS4 or PS5. You can read our PS5 review for a more detailed breakdown.Regardless of where you're playing, SM:MM's buildings are a lot more stunning while in motion--really, the whole city is. Taking a break from web-swinging or fighting crime to walk on the city streets and high-five pedestrians reveals somewhat drab NPC designs and no meaningful way for Miles to interact with his fellow citizens. Given that one of Miles' biggest motivations in the game is to connect with the people of his city, it's disappointing that there's no way to do so--the only choice you have when trying to help the people of New York is how exactly you want to beat up the problem they're facing.There are a few side missions that aren't about Miles fighting crime, though; these are found in the new app request side activities. Between chapters, Miles typically muses aloud that he should take a moment to respond to requests for help on his app. And it's in these bite-sized stories that you get to see Miles interacting with his community, albeit with shallow, forgettable characters save for a man who needs you to rescue his cat and a girl who's deaf and might have a crush on Miles. And honestly, I think it says a lot that I can only remember the cat's name, and that's only because it's ""Spider-Man,"" which is very memorable. But you have to purposely keep selecting these missions, otherwise Ganke calls after you complete one to let you know where to go next for the main campaign. Sometimes he doesn't even wait that long. He's called me on the way to responding to app requests to tell me about the very important story thing that Miles needs to do next. So you can either disrupt the overall flow of the main campaign to do side activities or keep up with the pace of the main story, which largely means rushing forward from chapter to chapter. It's a rather annoying pacing issue--I felt like Miles wouldn't do things like take a picture with a fan, track down lost toys, or break icicles off a crane when he has a lead on the Tinkerer.Gameplay-wise, SM:MM is built on the already solid foundation of 2018's Spider-Man, relying on a straightforward but still compelling timing system for both traversal and combat. Web-swinging through the air and catapulting off of rooftops is effortless to pick up, and combat and stealth sections aren't that much harder. However, despite how approachable the game is, SM:MM still pushes you to get better by rewarding you for pulling off more advanced timing on the tempo of Miles' web-swinging and combat abilities. Do you need to use these harder-to-time abilities to beat the game? No. But getting the timing down produces a flow-like rhythm to both traversal and combat, allowing them to more seamlessly mold together in an ever more satisfying way over time.Though Miles controls pretty much exactly like Peter did in 2018's Spider-Man, he has a few unique superpowers: venom strikes and camouflage. Miles' venom strikes offer him area-of-effect attacks, stunning and damaging groups of enemies. Meanwhile, his camouflage allows him to fairly easily reset a stealth encounter or perform silent takedowns that Peter couldn't do in the first game. But even without these abilities, Miles is as powerful as his mentor. I'd sometimes go entire fights without using any of the venom attacks because I forgot that they were there. The same goes for invisibility in some of the stealth sections.Miles' unique powers are his own, but they simply fit into Peter's already established moveset. So, despite being a new Spider-Man, Miles doesn't actually play like a new Spider-Man--which feels like a missed opportunity to use the gameplay to reinforce that Miles brings his own creative spin to his mentor's abilities. There are moments where using Miles' unique powers would be beneficial, but they're rare, relegating the venom strikes and camouflage to very specific situations. And since Miles is more than competent without venom or camouflage, the introduction of new enemy types that can temporarily disable his venom attacks or see him when he's invisible don't actually force you to get creative and tackle challenges in new ways.And so the difficulty of SM:MM remains fairly flat throughout the campaign, only spiking for boss battles--one of which I do really like because it forces you to constantly switch up between Miles' normal and venom attacks to chip away at the boss and use web-swinging or Miles' camouflage to safely maneuver around the small arena. But you can't just spam Miles' abilities because venom strikes, gadgets, and camouflage are necessary for controlling the crowd of normal enemies that are also present. It's such a cool battle of attrition and crowd management, one that encourages you to embrace Miles' powers and fight in a wholly different way to most of the campaign. The whole fight is very representative of how SM:MM could have benefited from more combat encounters that incorporate Miles' unique powers and highlight how his fighting style is different from Peter's.Like I said at the top of this review, SM:MM feels a lot like a missing chapter to 2018's Spider-Man. The gameplay is so similar, and the environment is largely the same. It's in the characters (especially Ganke and the Tinkerer) and the story that it tells that SM:MM manages to break free of what's been done already to deliver something that you'll want to see all the way through.It's a bit of a bummer to see Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales trip up at certain points, but thankfully, that doesn't happen often. The game wastes little time jumping you into Miles' story and rarely lets up on the brakes, packing the young wall crawler's first solo outing with more super powers and radio chatter than the game needs. And yet, despite its frantic pace, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a compelling open-world action game that helps highlight why Miles is so special: his culture. It's Miles' unique differences and earnest attempts at figuring out how to protect his community that make him into such a wonderful hero, not the mask he wears and superpowers he wields.Like Spider-Man Remastered before it, Nixxes has delivered a PC port for Spider-Man: Miles Morales that improves upon the visual features offered by the console version, allowing you to put your additional processing power to use while also supporting a wide range of PC-specific features that cater to all brands of GPUs out there. It also shows off some of the work Nixxes has done since the release of Spider-Man Remastered just a few months ago, with performance and hardware utilization noticeably better but not without room for further improvement.Spider-Man Miles Morales supports all of the features that Remastered does, including ultrawide displays, ray tracing, Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), AMD FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), and Insomniac's own upscaler, ITGI. New to Remastered, and by extension Miles Morales, is support for DLSS 3, which requires a new RTX 4090 or 4080 from Nvidia to make use of its AI-generated frame insertion. This creates a completely new frame after every traditionally rendered one to help boost framerates, with several caveats (strange visual abnormalities during repeated animations or poorly reconstructed frames, for example)that numerous deep dives have explored in exhaustive detail. It's not the star of the port given its reliance on cutting-edge new hardware, but it's good to see support here at launch.Ray tracing has previously been confined to reflections for Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but the PC version extends that to ray traced shadows. The difference this makes to overall image quality is far more subtle than that of reflections, but there's no question that it's an improvement when you stop to observe shadows being cast during a golden sunset, or along a snow-slick street bathed in lightning at night. There's a performance cost associated with having them on, so it should be one of the first things you toggle off if you're looking for more frames, but it's a nice addition for those with the hardware to support it to further accentuate this game's eye-catching visual details.In many ways, Miles Morales acts as a much better visual showpiece on PC than the previous Remastered entry does. Its winter setting allows for more wet puddles to populate streets and rooftops, bouncing light in all directions with blissful detail if you're dialing up the settings. The neon purple attacks of enemies and the way they reflect off the glossy coating of Miles' suit looks better here than it does on PS5 and leaves a greater lasting impression than the majority of the visual splendor of Peter's own adventure.Nixxes has done a lot of work since the original release to alleviate some of the issues with CPU bottlenecks, and if you haven't checked in since that launch, you might be surprised to see how far it's come. Swinging through the streets of New York, this time with ray-traced shadows added to the mix of the high preset and using the same hardware, I was able to maintain a frame rate consistently between 60-70fps. That's still relatively low for a game running at 1440p on an RTX 3080 Ti, but it's around the same average that I achieved in Spider-Man: Remastered just a few months ago without the additional strain of ray-traced shadows. With this setting off, performance was noticeably higher, while utilizing DLSS at its Balanced preset allowed me to enjoy the action without a dip below 80fps. These were scenarios around the game's open world, with indoor sections exhibiting the same jumps in performance as last time.This means that Spider-Man: Miles Morales is still quite CPU-limited when you're swinging around the city, but it's a noticeable improvement all around nonetheless. With that said, GPU and CPU utilization were still lower than desired, with the CPU (the same AMD 5600X as before) quickly standing out as the limiting factor. It's an improvement, but Miles Morales would benefit from more work here to run better with slower CPUs. In spite of that, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is as fantastic a port as Spider-Man: Remastered while also benefiting from the additional time Nixxes has had since the original release. If you've been waiting to play this since its debut nearly two years ago, there's no reason to wait any longer.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:A smaller game for a hero who cares about the little things while never forgetting the bigUnlike other heroes, Spider-Man’s identity expands rather than contracts. The costume is something anyone could theoretically wear. In Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Stan Lee has a cameo as a shopkeeper selling the Spider-Man suit: “It always fits. Eventually,” he says. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, the character’s creators, often spoke about Spider-Man being an “ordinary” person, rather than a billionaire playboy or godlike alien. Miles Morales, a Black and Latinx Spider-Man created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, has become the new “ordinary” face of the hero. He has his own current Marvel Comics series; he starred in Into the Spider-Verse; and now, he’s the protagonist of Insomniac Games’ new PlayStation exclusive.After finishing it, I was left with a sense of belonging, of intimacy with characters and relationships, in this scaled-down version of an open-world game. Miles Morales is a character who was created to make others feel like they belonged and were welcomed. And now, that’s accomplished off the back of one of the best action-adventure games I’ve ever played. Insomniac Games has said that Miles Morales is a follow-up but not a full sequel to its massively popular 2018 open-world web-’em-up, Marvel’s Spider-Man. This is a more self-contained spinoff, à la Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. The story is set in the same world and involves the same characters as the original game — including the newly redesigned Peter Parker, who was its main character. There are other notable cameos and larger roles I won’t spoil here. Miles has a moveset similar to Peter’s, but it’s not entirely the same; Insomniac has created unique animations and abilities just for Miles. He’s less graceful, yet he always tries to show off, even if it’s for no one in particular. He’s scrawnier and smaller, too. He can punch, kick, dive, and perform a range of Spider-Man maneuvers that are easy enough to pull off, but make the player “feel” like a superhero.Players don’t need to know the full details of the first game’s plot, let alone its three-chapter expansion, to appreciate Miles Morales. The previous game did show Miles gaining his powers after a genetically enhanced spider, numbered 42, bites him. This game recaps those events, along with the rest of Miles’ backstory, in a short catch-up video showing the trauma he experienced in losing his father, as well as him learning to tap into his inner strength, and eventually, master his powers. To be honest, the Miles sections of the first game were so short that they’re better off as cutscenes than as the boring insta-fail stealth sections they were. After the recap, Miles Morales shows us that Peter has been training Miles since the end of the first game’s campaign.Like in the first game, players will play as a Spider-Man who is somewhat experienced. He can already fight and utilize his basic powers, with further abilities revealing themselves over the course of the game. Anyone who has seen Into the Spider-Verse or read the comics can take a good guess at what Miles’ other gifts turn out to be.And what wonders they are to witness! Because this game is a visual spectacle. I have not been sent a PlayStation 5 at the time of writing, so I cannot speak to the next-generation console’s ability to do ray tracing and so forth, but, even on my base PS4, this is without a doubt the most beautiful game I’ve ever seen. The colors, textures, contrasts, animations, variety, and motion left me feeling constantly breathless, agape at the amount of incredible attention to detail that Insomniac’s artists and engineers managed to crank out of my nearly 7-year-old machine. The opening of the game is a showcase in making players truly feel like a superhero. Miles and Peter give chase to an angry Rhino (the longtime Spider-Man antagonist, not the animal), who is charging through Manhattan, destroying everything and everyone in his path. You see debris and cars, sparks and rocks, all flying past Miles’ head as he tries to rein in Rhino and save helpless bystanders. Not even Marvel films have managed such a visceral moment: Rhino leaps into a large shopping mall, and you see chunks of concrete burst with dust and debris — all without a load screen. Miles is then inside the shiny mall, with shop windows and patrons flying past, some diving out of the way, their bags collapsing at their feet. When the chase finally stopped, I literally swore aloud. Nothing from even the first game comes close to this and the other incredible set-pieces in Miles Morales. Insomniac has clearly learned from its previous work about how to extract synthesized superhero action with surgical precision. With Peter in another country, Miles finds himself as the Big Apple’s only Spider-Man. He’s caught between two warring factions: a strange, technology-obsessed underground movement called, er, The Underground, and a large, untouchable corporation called — sexily — Roxxon. While these appear at first to be two distant entities to Miles, the connections soon emerge, as Miles learns how close he actually is to people in both of these groups. The story allows for incredible visual spectacle: Underground members are draped in vibrant purples, while the heavily armored Roxxon uniforms are a piercing, menacing red. Combat with either group makes for a striking visual feast — but when it’s both groups against each other, the colors are wild. Each side also contains unique enemy types requiring different interventions, much like the first game. One type might be immune to frontal attacks, while others use firearms or brute strength.This requires players to adjust their response to the battlefield and utilize all of Miles’ moves and abilities. These are upgraded and acquired through a variety of differing and often confusing currencies: One type of mission will reward you with gadgets and tools, but not “tokens,” of which there are, in themselves, various types. I don’t like having to learn economics to figure out what I have to do to upgrade. It’s an annoying trend I’m sad to see here. I should note that this was in-game currency, not microtransactions — easily rewarded, just confusingly assigned.Aside from the initial loading and fast travel, I saw no loading screens; when Miles enters or exits a building or underground base, the game doesn’t cut away from the action. While I’m sure the PS5 will negate basically all loading screens, there won’t be a difference during the game itself unless you fast travel.Miles Morales also offers side quests about solving individual people’s problems. These are some of the game’s most fun and intimate missions. While they all eventually end up in punching people, there are sometimes puzzle elements. But the combat is exceptionally fun, joyous to watch and perform, just as it was in the first game; I never grew bored of it. Unique settings and locales mean that Miles won’t ever be performing the same combat against the same enemies — but, yes, at its base, it is almost always about punching something.As in the first game, Miles can also approach missions using stealth. And he’s much better at stealth than his mentor! Miles can grab enemies with his web silently, then tie them up or stick them to the wall. And he can ledge-grab enemies while stuck to the side of a wall or the ceiling, which Peter frustratingly could not do in the first game. At the end of it all, you can hear enemies’ struggles and see them fight against their cocoons — a sticky memorial to your success.As indicated, Miles Morales is smaller than the previous title: There are fewer missions, fewer objectives, fewer activities. This plays out in the story too, with Miles’ central focus being Harlem, as compared to almost the entirety of Manhattan in the first game. (Harlem is also a focal point for African American history, a place with a community that, in the words of Langston Hughes, fostered the “expression of our individual dark-skinned selves.”) Miles’ mother, Rio Morales, has moved the family into his grandmother’s apartment, and it is from here that Rio begins running for city council. The game creates a smaller, more intimate connection between Miles and the other people he meets, especially in his neighborhood — from his best friend and computer whiz Ganke to his uncle Aaron, from the local store owner with an adorable cat called Spider-Man to an older woman who refuses to be bullied by capitalist criminals. These relationships build to a wonderful payoff at the end. Adding to the emphasis on community is that the game does away with the police scanner and cop alerts that were a focus of the original Spider-Man. Instead, Ganke builds an app lets individual people report suspicious activity, allowing Miles to investigate without relying on the police.There’s something about a young Black American hero not trusting the police that hits pretty hard this year. Miles not relying on the cops to improve his predominantly BIPOC community is a notable turnaround from the white Peter Parker, who is aligned with the police in the original game. The cops here are also dismissive, rather than thankful, when they encounter Miles; their cheery familiarity with Peter Parker’s Spider-Man has been replaced with snark and distrust for Miles. Of course, the cops don’t know that Miles is a young Black man beneath the suit, but it’s almost fitting. There’s also no police ally character like the first game’s Yuri Watanabe. Overall, the police seem remarkably — and to my mind, thankfully — rather absent from this game.Despite Miles Morales being smaller, I found its size far more manageable and enjoyable. Side missions have more weight, as they tie back into recurring themes and characters Miles encounters even outside the suit. Those who use Ganke’s app are more likely to operate out of Harlem or know Miles, so Miles gets to relish alongside them in his civilian clothes after Spider-Man has helped them. The people Miles engages with are a diverse and important crowd: a queer couple, whose relationship no one comments on, that cares for the homeless; a talented artist who communicates with ASL (which Miles speaks fluently); and Miles’ mother, who seamlessly communicates with him in both Spanish and English.  Miles’ personality comes through far more than Peter’s did in the first Spider-Man. One time, while I had him sit on a wall surveying the city, Miles suddenly started bouncing on his haunches. Then I heard him mutter, and I realized he was humming a song he had made up. His hands flailing, he was clearly enjoying this tune. But this fits: When you return to his apartment, you see his music setup, and he is often trying to get people to listen to his beats. One of the side missions even involves Miles learning to make music out of the city’s sounds.  Again, it’s all connected. In other large open-world games, you can have many self-contained but ultimately limp subplots. Here, there are no side missions that just sit there in isolation. Due to the smaller size of the game, everyone touches everyone else. Stories intertwine, themes mingle; they are all, as it were, part of a web of relationships. And it is Miles who sits in the center of it all. His juvenile and naïve attempts to rectify one part of the web send tremors somewhere else. This net of responsibility is pulled taut, and Miles always feels like he’s failing. And, well, don’t we all feel that? In this chaotic year, I found inspiration in Miles’ ability to rise above challenges, to meet the face of catastrophe, to look darkness in the eyes. And not because he succeeds — indeed, he often fails. But it is his willingness to try, and also how other characters recognize his resilience and, despite his failures, remain by his side. What makes Miles an important hero for the world of 2020 is not his successes, his abilities, his fighting moves, or even his moral compass to do good: It’s his belief in himself and others that we can rise above this. That’s also his mother’s central focus for her political campaign. Miles has a relentless, if sometimes naïve, belief in others’ goodness. He wants to help the city and neighborhood he loves. And watching him try, watching his small victories, and playing through it with such beautiful animations — with nods to Into the Spider-Verse — became one of my few joys in this dark-as-shit year.  Miles does almost all of this not as a powerful superhero, but as an ordinary person. He just happens to be wearing the suit.And the suit always fits. Eventually.

   on November 18, 2022 at 9:43AM PSTEditor's note: Spider-Man: Miles Morales is releasing on November 12 for both PS5 and PS4. For this review, Jordan played on a PS4 Pro. Other GameSpot staff tested the game on PS5 and found it to be a largely comparable experience, with the PS5 version benefiting from improved visual flourishes and load times. For a technical-focused discussion of the PS5, and how Miles Morales benefits, check out our PS5 review. This review has also been updated by Alessandro Barbosa to reflect our experiences on PC.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales feels like the second half to The City That Never Sleeps, a three-part follow-up expansion to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man--the game even begins with the option to watch a short recap of the first game and its DLC in order to bring you up to speed on Miles' origins, reinforcing the notion that this is an extension of what's come before.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing--I like 2018's Spider-Man for its engaging combat loop, so I'm glad SM:MM emulates it. It's just that sometimes SM:MM can feel too similar to what's come before, which can get in the way of establishing Miles as his own brand of superhero. Regardless, the familiar trappings of SM:MM are used to tell an entirely fresh story with a few brand-new faces. And it's that narrative and those characters that manage to distinguish SM:MM as an open-world action game that's compelling to play.Like its predecessor, SM:MM throws you right into the action. After a short intro, Miles suits up and joins Peter Parker in escorting a convoy transporting supervillain Rhino, who's being taken back to prison after his escape in the previous game. Things don't go according to plan, but Miles manages to step up in a big way during the mission, proving to his mentor that he's capable of watching over New York City on his own for two weeks while Peter goes on a vacation with Mary Jane.I love this opening. There's a frantic pace to it; the game tosses you straight into its combat and traversal mechanics, immediately having you fight some escaped convicts before sticking you to the back of a rampaging Rhino. You need to steer the hulking brute around obstacles and pedestrians in a crowded shopping mall, and then you're flung into the open world to chase after the villain through the twists and turns of the city streets. And that's just the first 10 minutes. So even though the first few mechanics you learn are fairly straightforward--despite his inexperience, Miles controls just like Peter in the first game so web-slinging is practically effortless and combat isn't much harder--the sheer whiplash of needing to constantly adapt to different types of gameplay in such a short time puts you right into Miles' headspace. You can complete the level in one go because it's the prologue and it's easy, but it feels like Miles is just getting by and that Peter is doing most of the work anyway (he even covers for you when you make a mistake, like missing a quick-time prompt).In moderation, I think this would have been a great way to convey to the player how stressful Miles' newfound responsibility is. But SM:MM never lets up. It's high-key set piece after high-key set piece for most of its 11-hour runtime, with very little time reserved for quiet moments of reflection. Miles acquires a series of gadgets and abilities at a fairly steady pace as well (including his trademark venom sting and camouflage superpowers, which I'll get to in a bit), several of which emerge in unsatisfying ways as seemingly random bouts of deus ex machina. At times, it can feel like SM:MM is almost rushing towards its conclusion, desperate to deliver on the promise that Miles ends the game as a seasoned Spider-Man without really slowing down to show you how he manages to earn the respect and appreciation of a city that already knows and loves a Spider-Man.The main plot of SM:MM sees Miles simultaneously try to garner the favor of New York by fulfilling requests left by random New Yorkers on a smartphone app and stop the escalating conflict between Roxxon Energy Corporation and a gang called the Underground. Roxxon is buying up bits and pieces of Harlem to make room for reactors that will run on a brand-new energy source. Meanwhile, the Underground want to make a name for themselves, and thanks to the advanced arsenal of weapons they now have thanks to their new boss, the Tinkerer, the gang is setting its sights on destroying the prominent Roxxon.The story is your standard superhero affair with betrayals and ramifications that are familiar to the genre but still exciting to watch unfold. If anything, it's the characters who manage to keep SM:MM from feeling formulaic--the Tinkerer, especially. It's difficult to hype up how good of a villain they are without spoiling the best moments from SM:MM's campaign outright. When pressed, I've just been telling people that SM:MM does for the Tinkerer what the movie Spider-Man: Homecoming does for the Vulture. The game humanizes a classic but somewhat bland member of Spidey's rogues' gallery and gives them a compelling reason for why they turned to a life of crime, reinventing the character into more of a tragic figure. In a certain light, the Tinkerer's actions could be construed to be almost heroic (in an anti-hero sort of way), allowing the character to exist as a dark foil to Miles' Spider-Man. And at the center of that comparison between Miles and the Tinkerer is the two's shared life experiences.Prior to Miles' regular interactions with the Tinkerer, his evolution as a hero is primarily seen through his closest friends and confidants. Miles is surrounded by heroes, so a small but significant part of SM:MM is his musings about who he should be taking inspiration from. His friends serve as two sides of a coin, playing the roles of angels and devils in the debates that will define Miles. Ganke, for example, knows that Miles is Spider-Man and understands what Miles wants to get out of the role, but can't really empathize with Miles' Black or Puerto Rican heritage. Other friends and allies, however, more closely relate to Miles' cultural identities and struggles but don't understand the extent of his secret identity. Miles regularly talks to key members of the supporting cast throughout the first half of the campaign, and you get to see him coming to an understanding of what type of hero he wants to be through these conversations. It's awesome, and so when he dons his traditional black-and-red suit and emerges as a brand-new Spider-Man for the first time, one similar to but also altogether different from Peter Parker's Spider-Man, you can understand how he's grown to this point. You got to see it; you got to live through that internal turmoil with him.The child of a Black father and Puerto Rican mother, Miles is a wonderful mixture of cultures and languages. His building is adorned with the Puerto Rican flag, his family has an old collection of jazz and R&B vinyl records, and he seamlessly transitions between standard English, African-American Vernacular English, Spanish, and American Sign Language based on who he's talking to (occasionally even mixing together one or two of them). The way he leaps off of rooftops and flips backwards to face the camera before falling into a headfirst dive is just full of the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen--it gives me goosebumps every time he does it, especially as the music begins to swell.Speaking of, we've got to talk about the music in SM:MM. When Miles begins swinging, the orchestral score grows louder, but there's a nice synthetic hip-hop undercurrent to the whole thing. The music isn't as bombastic as that heard in 2018's Spider-Man. It instead crackles with a soft percussion--it reverberates in your ears with a steady crescendo that stops just short of overtaking the sounds of the city. It allows Miles (and to an extent, the player) to remain clued into New York even while soaring through the air at breakneck speeds to the sound of bomb-ass beats. I also need to shoutout SM:MM's use of Jaden Smith and Kid Cudi's ""On My Own,"" which is used perfectly in an introductory scene--it fits as well into the game as Post Malone and Swae Lee's ""Sunflower"" did in the movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Unfortunately, SM:MM can't slow down enough for you to really immerse yourself in the music that plays in the open world. If Ganke isn't calling to direct Miles to his next objective, then it's Miles' mother checking in or his uncle offering some advice or J. Jonah Jameson ranting about the new web-swinging menace or someone else. The game is constantly cutting off the music to deliver a new waypoint for you to follow or a conversation to listen to before the new waypoint appears. And thankfully, you can turn some of these voices off, but many are tied to the story--so you'll have someone almost always yapping in your ear. I'm enjoying traversal in the game far more now having finished the campaign, as I can just appreciate the rhythmic beat of the music while marveling at the beautiful murals, busy parks, and other aspects of New York culture that are on display in Harlem.The game does look better on PS5, but the difference isn't drastic enough to fundamentally change the experience.Speaking of, outside of Harlem (which has gotten a little bit of extra aesthetic love in order to better capture the culture of the area), SM:MM's New York is largely the same as the one in 2018's Spider-Man; the city is now just covered in snow and holiday decorations. I played the game on PS4 Pro and found SM:MM's graphics to look a lot like 2018's Spider-Man. A few of my coworkers have played SM:MM on PS5 and report that the game does look better on next-gen, but the difference isn't drastic enough to fundamentally change the experience--the game is sharper, reflections of characters in windows are far more clear, and load times are faster. The technical features provided by PS5's DualSense controller don't add anything essential to the gameplay either; there's trigger resistance to represent the effort Miles need to put in to shooting webs when soaring through the air, and subtle vibrations in the controller for whenever a phone vibrates or a train moves along a track. They're cool bells and whistles, but you're getting a similar experience whether you're playing on PS4 or PS5. You can read our PS5 review for a more detailed breakdown.Regardless of where you're playing, SM:MM's buildings are a lot more stunning while in motion--really, the whole city is. Taking a break from web-swinging or fighting crime to walk on the city streets and high-five pedestrians reveals somewhat drab NPC designs and no meaningful way for Miles to interact with his fellow citizens. Given that one of Miles' biggest motivations in the game is to connect with the people of his city, it's disappointing that there's no way to do so--the only choice you have when trying to help the people of New York is how exactly you want to beat up the problem they're facing.There are a few side missions that aren't about Miles fighting crime, though; these are found in the new app request side activities. Between chapters, Miles typically muses aloud that he should take a moment to respond to requests for help on his app. And it's in these bite-sized stories that you get to see Miles interacting with his community, albeit with shallow, forgettable characters save for a man who needs you to rescue his cat and a girl who's deaf and might have a crush on Miles. And honestly, I think it says a lot that I can only remember the cat's name, and that's only because it's ""Spider-Man,"" which is very memorable. But you have to purposely keep selecting these missions, otherwise Ganke calls after you complete one to let you know where to go next for the main campaign. Sometimes he doesn't even wait that long. He's called me on the way to responding to app requests to tell me about the very important story thing that Miles needs to do next. So you can either disrupt the overall flow of the main campaign to do side activities or keep up with the pace of the main story, which largely means rushing forward from chapter to chapter. It's a rather annoying pacing issue--I felt like Miles wouldn't do things like take a picture with a fan, track down lost toys, or break icicles off a crane when he has a lead on the Tinkerer.Gameplay-wise, SM:MM is built on the already solid foundation of 2018's Spider-Man, relying on a straightforward but still compelling timing system for both traversal and combat. Web-swinging through the air and catapulting off of rooftops is effortless to pick up, and combat and stealth sections aren't that much harder. However, despite how approachable the game is, SM:MM still pushes you to get better by rewarding you for pulling off more advanced timing on the tempo of Miles' web-swinging and combat abilities. Do you need to use these harder-to-time abilities to beat the game? No. But getting the timing down produces a flow-like rhythm to both traversal and combat, allowing them to more seamlessly mold together in an ever more satisfying way over time.Though Miles controls pretty much exactly like Peter did in 2018's Spider-Man, he has a few unique superpowers: venom strikes and camouflage. Miles' venom strikes offer him area-of-effect attacks, stunning and damaging groups of enemies. Meanwhile, his camouflage allows him to fairly easily reset a stealth encounter or perform silent takedowns that Peter couldn't do in the first game. But even without these abilities, Miles is as powerful as his mentor. I'd sometimes go entire fights without using any of the venom attacks because I forgot that they were there. The same goes for invisibility in some of the stealth sections.Miles' unique powers are his own, but they simply fit into Peter's already established moveset. So, despite being a new Spider-Man, Miles doesn't actually play like a new Spider-Man--which feels like a missed opportunity to use the gameplay to reinforce that Miles brings his own creative spin to his mentor's abilities. There are moments where using Miles' unique powers would be beneficial, but they're rare, relegating the venom strikes and camouflage to very specific situations. And since Miles is more than competent without venom or camouflage, the introduction of new enemy types that can temporarily disable his venom attacks or see him when he's invisible don't actually force you to get creative and tackle challenges in new ways.And so the difficulty of SM:MM remains fairly flat throughout the campaign, only spiking for boss battles--one of which I do really like because it forces you to constantly switch up between Miles' normal and venom attacks to chip away at the boss and use web-swinging or Miles' camouflage to safely maneuver around the small arena. But you can't just spam Miles' abilities because venom strikes, gadgets, and camouflage are necessary for controlling the crowd of normal enemies that are also present. It's such a cool battle of attrition and crowd management, one that encourages you to embrace Miles' powers and fight in a wholly different way to most of the campaign. The whole fight is very representative of how SM:MM could have benefited from more combat encounters that incorporate Miles' unique powers and highlight how his fighting style is different from Peter's.Like I said at the top of this review, SM:MM feels a lot like a missing chapter to 2018's Spider-Man. The gameplay is so similar, and the environment is largely the same. It's in the characters (especially Ganke and the Tinkerer) and the story that it tells that SM:MM manages to break free of what's been done already to deliver something that you'll want to see all the way through.It's a bit of a bummer to see Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales trip up at certain points, but thankfully, that doesn't happen often. The game wastes little time jumping you into Miles' story and rarely lets up on the brakes, packing the young wall crawler's first solo outing with more super powers and radio chatter than the game needs. And yet, despite its frantic pace, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a compelling open-world action game that helps highlight why Miles is so special: his culture. It's Miles' unique differences and earnest attempts at figuring out how to protect his community that make him into such a wonderful hero, not the mask he wears and superpowers he wields.Like Spider-Man Remastered before it, Nixxes has delivered a PC port for Spider-Man: Miles Morales that improves upon the visual features offered by the console version, allowing you to put your additional processing power to use while also supporting a wide range of PC-specific features that cater to all brands of GPUs out there. It also shows off some of the work Nixxes has done since the release of Spider-Man Remastered just a few months ago, with performance and hardware utilization noticeably better but not without room for further improvement.Spider-Man Miles Morales supports all of the features that Remastered does, including ultrawide displays, ray tracing, Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), AMD FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), and Insomniac's own upscaler, ITGI. New to Remastered, and by extension Miles Morales, is support for DLSS 3, which requires a new RTX 4090 or 4080 from Nvidia to make use of its AI-generated frame insertion. This creates a completely new frame after every traditionally rendered one to help boost framerates, with several caveats (strange visual abnormalities during repeated animations or poorly reconstructed frames, for example)that numerous deep dives have explored in exhaustive detail. It's not the star of the port given its reliance on cutting-edge new hardware, but it's good to see support here at launch.Ray tracing has previously been confined to reflections for Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but the PC version extends that to ray traced shadows. The difference this makes to overall image quality is far more subtle than that of reflections, but there's no question that it's an improvement when you stop to observe shadows being cast during a golden sunset, or along a snow-slick street bathed in lightning at night. There's a performance cost associated with having them on, so it should be one of the first things you toggle off if you're looking for more frames, but it's a nice addition for those with the hardware to support it to further accentuate this game's eye-catching visual details.In many ways, Miles Morales acts as a much better visual showpiece on PC than the previous Remastered entry does. Its winter setting allows for more wet puddles to populate streets and rooftops, bouncing light in all directions with blissful detail if you're dialing up the settings. The neon purple attacks of enemies and the way they reflect off the glossy coating of Miles' suit looks better here than it does on PS5 and leaves a greater lasting impression than the majority of the visual splendor of Peter's own adventure.Nixxes has done a lot of work since the original release to alleviate some of the issues with CPU bottlenecks, and if you haven't checked in since that launch, you might be surprised to see how far it's come. Swinging through the streets of New York, this time with ray-traced shadows added to the mix of the high preset and using the same hardware, I was able to maintain a frame rate consistently between 60-70fps. That's still relatively low for a game running at 1440p on an RTX 3080 Ti, but it's around the same average that I achieved in Spider-Man: Remastered just a few months ago without the additional strain of ray-traced shadows. With this setting off, performance was noticeably higher, while utilizing DLSS at its Balanced preset allowed me to enjoy the action without a dip below 80fps. These were scenarios around the game's open world, with indoor sections exhibiting the same jumps in performance as last time.This means that Spider-Man: Miles Morales is still quite CPU-limited when you're swinging around the city, but it's a noticeable improvement all around nonetheless. With that said, GPU and CPU utilization were still lower than desired, with the CPU (the same AMD 5600X as before) quickly standing out as the limiting factor. It's an improvement, but Miles Morales would benefit from more work here to run better with slower CPUs. In spite of that, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is as fantastic a port as Spider-Man: Remastered while also benefiting from the additional time Nixxes has had since the original release. If you've been waiting to play this since its debut nearly two years ago, there's no reason to wait any longer.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"The title screen of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales hit me like a subway train. It shows the title character, in a fur-lined winter coat and salt-speckled Timbs, as he taps away on his phone and listens to music while riding public transit. From the coat to the boots, I have been that kid. And for the first time in my gaming career, I looked like him, too. But the déjà vu doesn’t end there. Start playing the game, and you’ll feel like you’ve done much of this before, too.You most likely did it two years ago, when Insomniac Games first released Marvel’s Spider-Man and established a refreshing take on the world of the eponymous wall-crawler. Just like their heroic protagonists, both games are working from the same genetic blueprint. When so much between these two titles is the same, the differences become even more crucial. And that’s where things get complicated.Let’s get this out of the way: in terms of scope, size, and basic time to complete, Miles Morales is a shorter game than the original. Insomniac’s latest version of New York City is functionally identical to how it was before, which makes sense given that’s how cities work. But locations of major setpieces in the original, like offshore supermax prison The Raft (located in the East River for plot-convenient Spider-access) and Oscorp Tower, are entirely absent in this game. Even with some newly-added locations sewn into the fabric of NYC, most of them fail to feel like substantial additions. I cleared the game with 100% completion in under 20 hours, and I probably could have finished the main story in about 10-12 hours.Miles Morales is also a more narrowly-focused game than the original, and I’m not saying that in a negative way. The best moments in this game are in its specificity, in how it shows the player what it would feel like not to just be Spider-Man, but to be a Spider-Man frequently compared to the original. You’ll see the same things from new perspectives, and in that way they’re almost brand new. It quickly becomes a game about how people can live in the same city and have entirely different experiences within it. From its story beats to its character arcs, it succeeds when it lingers on the small differences that fill our lives. I wish it did that more; in a way, despite its shorter playtime, I wish it went even smaller.The core gameplay iterates heavily on the original game; players will once again guide their Spider-Man through an open-world New York City, taking on cinematic story-based missions and procedurally-generated random crimes in equal measure. Web swinging still feels intuitive and joyous like nothing else in gaming, and combat is still a frantic mix of strategic pre-brawl planning and chaotic mid-fight calibrations to address new threats. Miles’ new powers add a dose of stealth and risk-reward mechanics to fights, but no one has reinvented the Big Wheel here. Old fans can sink right back into the flow like a warm bath after a hard day (or a hard year, let’s be real), and newcomers will jump right into an opening half hour that condenses everything I love about Spider-Man into a prologue filled with action, comedy, and heart.Set roughly a year after the conclusion of Spider-Man (complete with a “Previously On” recap option to set the tone), the story introduces us to a Miles Morales deep into his superhero training alongside Peter Parker. It’s the night before Christmas, and after thwarting an escape attempt from Rhino and discovering a new, electricity-based quirk to his Spider-Powers, Miles is thrown for an even bigger loop: Peter and MJ are taking a long-overdue work vacation to Europe, and the newbie Spider-Man will now be the only one in New York City over the holiday season.To love Spider-Man, as a character and as a concept, is to love Peter Parker. But that built-in love from the audience is always a sticking point for Miles Morales stories, which need to find a way (usually, a tragic one) to remove Peter so another Spidey can get the chance to shine. Sending Pete overseas to Symkaria is a smart way to reach this same outcome, and within the first hour the player (and Miles) truly feels alone. Naturally, super-crimes follow. But this time, they feel like digressions from the best parts of the game’s story. I slowly found myself wanting to punch less and talk more.At the start of the game, Miles and his mother, Rio, have moved into his abuela’s old apartment in Harlem to recover from their family’s tragic losses the year before. Ganke Lee, Miles’ best friend from high school, is staying with them over winter break, turning them into a makeshift family unit. These dynamics are perfectly sketched out during a Christmas Dinner scene where the player helps Miles navigate family time and covert wall-crawling to restore power to their building. Rio is running for City Councillor; Ganke is developing a video game. Every single character in Miles Morales has something they believe in and are fighting for. Spider-Man stories don’t work if the interior lives of their characters aren’t acknowledged; the gut punch of missing dinner with a friend needs to land just as hard as a closed fist from a supervillain to sell the struggle of a web-slinger’s double life. But inevitably, the game gives you someone to punch.The main storyline of Miles Morales involves yet another formerly-obscure gang, The Underground, and their violent campaign to wage war against the monolithic energy conglomerate, Roxxon. A new supervillain, The Tinkerer, drives much of the story as their influence over The Underground (and hatred of Roxxon) leads to plot twists and explosions in equal measure. Miles doesn’t face off against as many villains as Peter did in the previous game, but every rogue in his gallery makes a strong impression and serves a purpose in his path to becoming a superhero on his own terms. Earning the respect of your community doesn’t come from your ability to tie violent offenders up in webbing, it comes from being a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. So I guess it’s time to talk about cops.The problems and criticisms of the original game’s relationship with policing are well-publicized, and I felt them personally during my initial playthrough two years ago. They felt tone-deaf back then, a strangely stubborn declaration that in The Marvel Universe, the problems raised by institutional racism and the role police can play in upholding it were practically non-existent. In 2020, that position would be incoherent for a game set in contemporary New York City. So Miles Morales, unintentionally or not, goes in a different direction..Despite his father’s (who is never portrayed as anything less than a saint) career as an officer in the PDNY (a change to the real-world acronym that feels purposeful), cops don’t play a major part in Miles’ life. He’s a mixed-race Black and Latinx teenager, and the game never asks us to do the mental gymnastics to justify why he would be exceedingly pro-police. Instead, early in the game, Ganke finishes the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (FNSM) App, which feels like a mix between Nextdoor and Postmates. New Yorkers share problems they’re having, or crimes they’ve witnessed, and Spider-Miles swings by to see if he can help. It feels just right for how a brilliant, tech-fluent teenager would want to communicate with his city today, and it shows us Insomniac’s solution to the Spider-Cop Problem: Community Service.After thwarting a random bodega robbery, I heard Miles insisting he should leave before the cops show up, because they “weren’t big Spider-fans.” Later in the game, a character reveals that Miles’ father, Jefferson Davis, joined the police to try to change it from within, and “probably died trying.” This is a game that realized it could not ask players to feel like Miles Morales without considering how he would feel about the police.Or how the police would feel about him.It’s a truism to the point of parody that a superhero video game “Makes You Feel Just Like X.” And yes, obviously releasing your web at the top of your parabola, doing a double backflip, landing on a streetlight, and then webbing a gun-toting gang member to a wall makes me feel like Spider-Man.But read the title. This game wants you to feel like Miles Morales. In its absolute best moments it succeeds like few games I’ve ever played.In that same early-game Christmas dinner scene, Rio asks Miles to select an album from his dad’s record collection to play during the party. After digging through three boxes, the player can choose from three records: “Moanin’” by Miles Davis, “Esta Navidad” by Willie Colón, and “Merry Christmas Baby” by Otis Redding. There’s no wrong answer here, but it felt like each record spoke to a key family member in Miles’ life, and the player was given the choice to code switch between those different worlds. Once again, I have been that mixed-race teen leaning into different sides of his heritage. I went with Otis Redding. Later on in the game, you can put on another track as you hang around at home. I sampled Willie Colón that time. No wrong answers.The game’s best side quests are equally intimate, showing us how Miles and the people he loves have left their mark on the city. From geocaching for old time capsules, to an audio scavenger hunt to stitch together an unfinished hip hop beat, these missions are similar to Peter Parker’s lost backpacks in the original game. But while those backpacks mostly served as an easter egg delivery device for tons of sly Spidey references, Miles’ collect-a-thons feel like love letters. While the usual rewards for finding them all are still here (I can confirm the two dozen suits to collect completely rule), by the end of each quest I felt far more satisfaction from how I came to better understand Miles, the people in his life, or the relationships between them. It helped me see the city through his eyes, and my other senses followed.Early in the game, Miles catches half of a predictably-furious rant from J. Jonah Jameson before he does something Peter Parker never could: he changes the channel to Danika Hart, a teenage podcaster whose mix of bubbly self-care tips and sincere citizen journalism are a far cry from the conservative ragefest of JJJ’s show. When swinging around the city and webbing up bad guys, the soaring adaptive orchestral soundtrack from the first game has been chopped and screwed into a perpetual beat. Strings roar to life alongside snare hits when Miles lays a punch or jumps off another building. Throughout the story, we are continually shown that beats and music are truly a part of his world. It makes sense that they’re the core of his superhero theme, too.Since it’s technically a next-gen launch title, Miles Morales seems like it was purpose-driven to showcase graphical flourishes as much as possible. (I played on a standard PS4, but this is very much the star of the PS5 launch lineup as well.) Multiple missions in the game take place during light snowfall or heavy blizzards, and the on-screen action was smooth as butter. When you select a gadget or open your App menu, the game slows down enough to let you count individual snowflakes. Miles’ unique Spider-powers take the form of orange electricity, adding another layer of pyrotechnics to every battle. And make no mistake: you’ll be using those electricity powers a lot.Miles feels weaker than Peter Parker, and I’m not sure if that’s by design or due to my own average action-gaming skills. His powers (turning temporarily invisible and unleashing powerful electric strikes once he’s built up enough meter) are integral to every puzzle and enemy engagement past the start of the game. Your main enemies share the gimmick of being able to change their weapons on the fly, which means you can find yourself surrounded and defeated in a matter of seconds if you don’t plan your moves right.I died at least once in every major story mission, and eventually defaulted to taking out a few enemies while invisible, retreating to the rafters to recharge, and repeating the cycle until a room was cleared. Your mileage may vary, but I’ve always felt that Insomniac’s approach to stealth gaming works better in theory than it feels practice. But even those powers help me feel more like Miles Morales; he first gains the ability to turn invisible while standing with his hands up asking a half-dozen gunmen not to shoot.Because of Sony’s restrictions tied to being able to review the game in advance of release, I’m not allowed to discuss the main characters and villains of Miles Morales, but most of the game revolves around how Miles struggles to connect with and understand both groups respectively. The voice cast is uniformly fantastic; Yuri Lowenthal does a lot with a little in his repeat performance as Peter Parker, and Nadji Jeter brings warmth and heart to Miles, a role he’s held since 2017’s Spider-Man animated series.Some of those unnameable characters are portrayed with nuance and power by Jasmin Savoy Brown (The Leftovers), Ike Amadi (Knack), and Todd Williams (The Chicago Code), and all of the game’s most emotionally resonant moments land because of them. At the same time, industry heavyweights like Troy Baker and Ashly Burch bring side characters like Simon Krieger and Danika Hart to life with smarm and charm, respectively.Miles’ voice lines were recorded twice, and are switched out depending on whether the player is resting or web-swinging while he speaks. Every single time you shoot webs, a tiny “thwip” sound comes out of the controller/your wrists. As reported, Miles is wearing Adidas in his starter outfit, but to their credit, they look exactly like a pair of track-worn Adidas. This is a game that wants you to care about the tiniest details and moments, because its ultimate thesis is that Miles isn’t just Spider-Man; he’s the Spider-Man that looks and sounds like New York City in a way Peter Parker doesn’t.Just as Miles’ amateur style of web swinging leads to much more spinning and flailing than Peter’s polished form, this is where Miles Morales slips and falls at the height of its arc. Because I was so impressed with the tiny details, the missing pieces stood out even more.Miles’ bedroom looks exactly like you would expect, until you look at the posters on his wall. Near his door, a legally-distinct-from-Michael-Jordan basketball player leaps towards the net surrounded by the words “FIGHT WELL STAY STRONG.” As an avid hip hop fan, it makes sense that you’d find some rapper’s poster in his room; instead, there’s just a monochromatic shot of a nonspecific rapper above the words “New York HIP HOP.” The shape is there, but the texture has been filed off, probably for licensing reasons.But what happens when you similarly sand down the texture of the entire neighborhood that Miles is ostensibly fighting for? (Note: I’m not from Harlem; I’m a Canadian who has visited NYC twice as a tourist and hit up Harlem for waffles.) Miles Morales wants to tell the story of how its main character comes into his own as a superhero by embracing what makes him different, and finding the people he can fight for. It wants to show us how he grows to love and respect his new neighborhood (and how his neighbors do the same for him in turn) by helping them with problems big and small. The best moments of the game are when supervillains and dramatic reveals are sidelined for moments of human decency and an obscenely-lovable cast of bodega owners, barbers, and people looking out for each other.However, it all happens too fast and too infrequently. Within a handful of hours (and an even smaller number of missions) I went from meeting these people for the first time to watching Miles declare he would do anything for them. I got the impression that certain local landmarks (a park, a bodega) were supposed to burn themselves in my mind forever, but I always had to resort to the mini-map to find my way around. I was told I was playing as the Spider-Man of Harlem, but I spent most of my time in the skies and rooftops of the borough as a whole. I wanted to slow down and build the relationships the game was all too quick to sketch out in shorthand. But this is a superhero story, and superhero things had to happen. “There are no good optics for destroying a child.”Spider-gig economy simulatorA refinement of the mechanics and gameplay loops of 2018’s game, excellent and genuinely touching sidequests and plot moments, web swinging is so fun it feels wrong in 2020.Combat can become a hectic trial-and-error situation, the main storyline ends up feeling generic and safe compared to other moments, not enough Harlem.Insomniac GamesPlayStation 4 (played), PlayStation 5November 1220 hours, completing 100% of missions on Amazing difficulty and getting the Bodega Cat outfitBasically, I wish Miles Morales’ Harlem was like the Yakuza franchise’s Kamurocho. I would vastly prefer more lowkey interactions to build my understanding and affection for this neighborhood over the dozen-or-so sidequests and action setpieces I was given instead. Despite the everyman archetype, Insomniac’s Spider-Man just isn’t that type of street-level hero. I understand my wish for a smaller, slice-of-life approach to one of the most recognizable fictional characters on Earth is probably a weird one.But I feel like Insomniac wanted to go that way, too. Because of a mural.Once you finish all of the non-procedural sidequests in the FNSM App (something I pulled off after 10 hours or so), Miles is given one final task: head to a parking lot in the Financial District where grateful people in the city have left him a gift. It’s a sweet moment that drives home the love and support Miles has earned on his own. And then you wind up in front of a gigantic five-story Black Lives Matter mural.I’m pretty sure this is the first acknowledgement of BLM in a video game ever. While the games industry blasted off messages of support in varying levels of quality and sincerity this past summer, I can’t think of a high-profile game that has taken the step to canonically acknowledge, and by extension immortalize, this movement and the moment in history it signifies. The mural is always there; you can seek it out as soon as you’ve finished the first introductory mission. But the game knows what it’s doing by putting this gift of gratitude in front of that image. You cannot finish all the sidequests or acquire every suit without seeing the mural. It’s a statement.Superhero stories have always struggled to effectively portray problems that can’t be punched in the face, usually only acknowledging real-world societal issues when they’re inescapable or undeniable. To be a Black fan of comics, you have to calibrate your expectations on the low end and expect to deal with stereotypes and gaffes from even your most beloved creators. I truly didn’t expect Miles Morales to approach even half of the issues it broaches, ending on a note that I can only describe as a celebration (and lowkey analysis) of Black Excellence in several forms. It’s not perfect, but it’s something.And that’s how I feel about the mural. If BLM exists in Marvel’s New York City, so too must the millions of injustices and tragedies that transformed a fact of life into a rallying cry. Harlem in Miles Morales is a neighborhood on the edge of multiple types of eradication, from financial, to cultural, to (eventually) physical. The game borrows and references visual moments and plot beats from almost every Spider-Man movie to date in its attempt to paint Miles as Harlem’s champion. But not all of the problems he’s fighting can be webbed away, and he’s just a kid. The mural serves as a testament to that dichotomy: whether it’s our New York City or Miles’, Black lives are inescapable and undeniable. One of the most unexpected surprises I found while playing Marvel’s Spider-Man in 2018 was how willing the story was to dip into the outright tragic and invest in the emotional lives of its characters in a way few superhero games had done at that point. Miles Morales takes equally huge emotional swings across its story, but it ends on an epilogue of unambiguous hope and joy. That, too, hits different in 2020.Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a beautiful game with a big heart, weighed down by the obligation inherent to all the names in its title. In its absolute best and most joyfully surprising moments, it reminds us that cities are shared spaces with overlapping stories. It shows us that the opposite of web-swinging through Manhattan isn’t stealth setpieces and fight scenes with dozens of enemies, but chatting with your deaf/hard-of-hearing neighbor using sign language. It plays, looks, and feels like the game it evolved from, but it has aims that are both bigger in theme and smaller in scope. It takes a hard look at problems and stories that don’t involve punching, but ultimately becomes a Story About Punching. It’s a game that feels short not from a lack of open-world icon-hunting busywork, but because its final moments ask us to invest in spectacle and rushed plot resolutions after a dozen hours of treating us to human-level substance. Miles Morales excels in its smallest moments, and I wish it had the confidence to stand by them to the end. Maybe next time, True Believers.Editor’s note: Kotaku readers might be particularly interested in knowing that our former longtime colleague, Evan Narcisse, was one of the writers on this game."
USgamer,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a very typical sort of console launch title. It's impressive in places, but clearly still rummaging about in the remnants of the last generation. It's a shorter experience, which surely will have made that new-generation development easier. That said, it's also content-rich enough that it's the ideal relaxing binge with which to ease yourself into your snazzy new hardware.Did you play 2018's Spider-Man on PS4? If you did, you'll already have a pretty good idea of how you'll feel about Miles Morales. This is a game running on the same technology, with many of the same game systems and mechanics in place. Miles is just different enough to Peter Parker to be distinct, but he's ultimately still Spider-Man.That means you're still tooling around in New York, just as in that game. It's essentially the same open-world, though now at a different time of year, with Miles Morales a Christmas story that sadly doesn't really do enough with the time of year to feel like Christmas is central to the narrative. That's a shame, as I love when media does that, with the quintessential example, of course, being Die Hard - though even in games, a mediocre game like Dead Rising 4 was enhanced by its Christmas trappings. Still, the icy, decorated New York is at least pretty, and those who unwrap this on the 25th will find things appropriately seasonal enough.Playing this new Spider-Man adventure breaks down into a few basic categories. First, you roam the open world by swinging, running, clambering, and mantling about the towering buildings of New York. It still feels great, and Miles has his own unique way of moving and swinging that differentiates him from Peter.Traversal is fun, but it's also used to get from point-to-point. Story missions and more narratively involved side quests will be your primary points of call, but there's also a grab-bag of simpler, shorter 'Friendly Neighborhood' quests that Miles picks up through his cell phone. The randomly generated, endlessly-repeating crimes from the 2018 game are back, too, popping up as you travel through the game world.. Finally, there's a range of collectibles to grab which in turn feed into your character upgrades and completion percentage.All of this is fairly similar to 2018’s Spider-Man, though there are slight presentation changes to better fit the Miles character. The same is true of combat; it's still that rhythmic, combo and dodge heavy superhero battling first coined by the Arkham games, and there's still stealth segments that similarly borrow from the caped crusader, but Miles has unique powers that set his Spider-Man apart. 
 
The two most important of these differences are Miles' bioelectric venom powers and his ability to turn invisible. The venom powers let you empower attacks with electric zaps that can spread between enemies and leave them more vulnerable to other attacks. Turning invisible is pretty obvious, and it makes stealth a lot more fun in this game. Takedowns that were previously impossible are now more realistic as you can perform them while cloaked and then zip back to a hiding spot before the very limited active camouflage expires.Like I said earlier, Miles feels sufficiently different enough to Pete to be defined, but similar enough that everything that worked about 2018's Spider-Man remains intact. It's lightly iterative in a way that perhaps wouldn't go over so well in a 'full sequel', but it's pretty much understood that this is more of a stop-gap spin-off sort of deal.Speaking of that, let's talk about the size of the game. The comparison to something like Uncharted: Lost Legacy is actually pretty fair. The core story probably takes a similar sort of time, in the 7-10 hour range. I polished off most of the side content for a total completion percentage of 98%; that took me a little over 12 hours, which felt just right to me. The next-generation nature of this game means that it still has a discount price compared to most new releases, but it's also more expensive than a similarly sized PS4-generation game like 2017's Lost Legacy. Take from that what you will.The story told here is also keen to emphasize the differences between the original and new Spider-Man. Miles is incredibly well-realized, with a believable supporting cast of characters. Great pride is taken in Miles' status as a mixed-race hero from African American and Puerto Rican heritage, and as a biracial person myself it's rare and exciting to see that represented well in video games. Completing one line of side quests leads to a brief but prominent and unflinching Black Lives Matter tribute, which is both surprising and pleasing to see in a big-budget, mainstream video game. 
 
This is a PlayStation 5 launch game, but it's also coming to PS4. I haven't tested the PS4 version, but assume it's fine - it will lack the PS5-exclusive improvements, but Spider-Man ran well on PS4 in 2018 and this game is so similar that it's unlikely to have any major performance issues.As a PS5 launch title, Miles Morales is, like I said, sort of a classic day-one game. Exclusive or not, launch titles are often ported from the previous generation and prettied up, and this feels like that. What's impressive is how much the core features of the PS5 neatly slot into proceedings without feeling disruptive or over-the-top.That blazing fast SSD storage means that loads are stupid quick, for instance. Fast travel is no longer a chore because it's pretty much instant. Visuals are sharpened nicely with silky smooth performance in 4K with HDR - and then there's the ray tracing. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are used, but so subtly in this particular title that you don't notice them very much.Ray tracing seems to be the feature that most excited the developers at Insomniac, because it's absolutely everywhere in this game. It has an excellent implementation - and if you stop for a moment to cling to the side of a skyscraper and take in how real-time reflections of New York are painted onto its huge window panes, you'll be impressed. Some of Miles' spider-suits also have surfaces that show up ray-traced reflections, too - and that looks great when he's in motion. Every now and then you'll see ray-traced reflections 'pop-in' onto a surface if you're moving fast and come to a sudden stop, but this is rare.In fact, the ray tracing probably goes a long way to make this PS4 title feel more like a next-generation game. The key character models are still gorgeous and impressive, for instance, but they're not dissimilar to what we've already seen on PS4. The real-time lighting enhances the whole world, however, kicking everything up a notch.And, honestly, that's it. I reiterate again - how much did you like 2018's Spider-Man? If you loved it, this is more of the same. If you never played it, this remains a fun and engaging open-world hero game that's relatively untaxing, the gaming equivalent of a popcorn action flick. Naturally, if you hated the previous game, give this a miss. The X-Factor is the price, which for some might be too rich for what is essentially a beefed-up expansion.Launch games are rarely remembered as earth-shattering experiences years later, but at the time, elements of them always feel magical. On PS5, Miles Morales has both of these feelings down - it's familiar and unsurprising, but some of its technical presentation will wow you nevertheless. If you're picking up a PS5 on launch day, for that reason this will surely do.

Destructoid,"darkBack in 2018, I talked about how much Spider-Man, as a character, meant to me.It sounds hyperbolic, but fiction can absolutely get people through some tough times, especially if that character is particularly relatable. Okay, maybe not Spider-Man himself, but Peter Parker sure gets the job done.The thing is, there are lots of different versions of Spider-Man that people can relate to. Now, we just got another one in Miles Morales — and like the first time around, Insomniac did its job once again.Spider-Man: Miles Morales (PS4, PS5 [reviewed])Developer: Insomniac GamesPublisher: SonyReleased: November 12, 2020MSRP: $49.99Although Peter is a part of the intro mission, this is very much Miles’ story: as the former is whisked away to Europe fairly quickly with his significant other and stealth-sequence expert Mary Jane Watson. New York only has one Spider-Man in it for the time being.From the start, it does a really good job of bringing you in where you need to be. It’s not an origin per se (the ending of the first game took care of that); it’s more like a Batman Year One tale after he has some of the toys. If you want, you can get a quick recap of the original, but it’s not wholly necessary since, again, this is an isolated story that involves Miles, his family and circle of friends, and new villains. Beyond a few Easter eggs, you can also go straight to this version and be fine.Over time I started to realize how different Miles Morales really was. Sure it has a lot of the same framework mechanically (both in and out of combat), but this is a much more personal story. It fits the game perfectly and allows it to step out of the shadow of Peter Parker, with a large focus on the people close to Miles that most players haven’t quite met yet. The Christmas time period and wintery sparkle of the city also help add to the feeling that this is not a copy-and-paste job.My most beloved element of the game though has to be Miles himself. As most Spider-Verse film fans know, he’s quite the character, with his own insecurities and demons he has to reckon with in addition to his heroic responsibilities. Insomniac manages to showcase his personality not just with the narrative, but with subtle in-game animations too. Sometimes Miles will struggle with an attack or even look off-balance. He’s also willing to be heroic out of the costume, too.Seeing as this is a PS5 game after all, it’s also important to talk about all of the next-gen goodies. The big (and I can’t stress this enough) thing that stands out to me way more than the visual upgrades is the load time situation: or, lack thereof. The SSD effect is real, with the game taking mere seconds to load up or fast travel. There were times in the original where it was sometimes quicker to manually zip to a location as to not force a load — but in Miles Morales, he literally walks out of a fast-travel point in about a second. I hope the entire generation is this fast.The visual options are slightly less impressive but totally workable, especially if you were fine with the situation in the original. Insomniac makes you choose between 30FPS and ray tracing or 60FPS, the latter of which provides a “4K picture from a lower resolution base.” While native 4K/ray tracing/60 is ideal, the game is absolutely fine in either setting, and the ray-tracing effects (including the puddles) look great.Combat is still very smooth, with Insomniac nailing the agility and strength of the Spider-Man character in an action system that mostly emulates the original. Miles has two powers at his disposal that are important to note: a bio-electric shock ability (Venom Blast) and a camouflage skill. The former really reminds me of the neon aesthetic from inFamous: Second Son in all the best ways, how it pops when you’re blasting a single target or unleashing an electric blast into a crowd.Miles’ camouflage, like most of its gaming ilk, is governed by a meter, which depletes as the ability is used or after you whack an enemy out of stealth. I’m sure some people will feel like camouflaging makes the stealth sequences easier, but they’re also more fun as a result. Miles can speed through those portions of the game a little quicker than Peter, but you still have to maintain a degree of anonymity, lest you blow your cover.Miles also sports four gadgets (one of which is the classic web shooter) in tandem with his newfound skills, giving the whole game a welcome allure of familiarity. Insomniac did not have to reinvent the wheel here, so this approach is appreciated.I’m nearly done with the review, but I felt compelled to answer a still-burning question for some: so what exactly is this game? I know it’s been confusing. So the answer really is: “it’s something like Uncharted: Lost Legacy.” It’s a shorter, roughly 10-hour (or less) campaign that can be stretched to 15 hours or so if you go for a 100% rating/Platinum trophy. Once that’s in the bag, you can opt for a New Game+ run, which has its own unique unlocks in tow.While you might want more, the benefit of this approach is that the game doesn’t feel bloated nor does it overstay its welcome. The in-game challenges and collectibles never get out of hand, and there’s only two easy-to-follow currencies to juggle. I actually 100%ed it with gusto for this review because I was compelled to.Just like Into the Spider-Verse, I was pleasantly surprised by Miles Morales. I came in fully expecting it to be a side story, but it was much more than that. If this is setting us up for Spider-Man 2 where both Miles and Peter are playable: I’m in.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

SPIDER-MAN: MILES MORALES REVIEW FOR PS4 AND PS5. There has been a fair bit of confusion leading up to the release of Spider-Man: Miles Morales about whether it’s an expansion to Spider-Man PS4 or an entirely new experience. After playing it, it’s easiest to describe it as “Spider-Man 1.5.” It’s entirely standalone and continues on from the 2018 release in a bigger way than the DLCs did, but it doesn’t feel like a full-blown sequel. This is more of what we loved from the original, but with some special twists that make Miles stand out in both story and gameplay.In Spider-Man PS4, players controlled a veteran Peter Parker who was at peak ability. After many movies, Parker’s origin story is a tired topic, and it was good to immediately jump into the role of an experienced webhead. With Miles, players are handed a hero who has been training alongside Peter Parker for a year, and so is useful but has room to grow. He must learn to balance his hero and home lives in his own way, while also getting used to his more unique powers.Like we saw with Spider-Man PS4, Insomniac Games uses the success and popularity of hero movies to subvert player expectations. This happens again with Miles Morales, as heroes and villains are given their own unique spins, and it works well. Insomniac know that players will likely have seen the fantastic Into the Spider-Verse movie and so instead aim in a different direction.New named villains are a little sparse with Insomniac opting for a more intimate clash. There are still multiple factions battling for dominance, which is as chaotic as you would expect, but the scale isn’t as large as it was in Spider-Man PS4.Overall, the story is solid with some interesting character interactions and developments that set things up nicely for an obvious sequel.Spider-Man PS4 wowed us in 2018 with awesome visuals and Spider-Man: Miles Morales is here in 2020 to do it again. If a game has a Photo Mode, it usually knows how good it looks. Sound design is on point, too, and I approve of Miles’ choice in music and how the game uses that in side-mission gameplay.It’s wintertime in New York, which makes for a subtly different environment. It’s familiar, but different enough. What’s more, the focus on Miles’ new home in Harlem allows for an exploration of the culture there, making it feel more alive and, ultimately, worth protecting.The addition of Miles’ more unique moves makes for some insane visual effects amidst combat, elevating it to become even more satisfying than the first game. The redesign of Peter Parker might be jarring to those coming from Spider-Man PS4, but I quickly forgot about it. He’s here, so deal with it and move on.While I played through Miles Morales on PS4 Pro, where the experience was on-par with Spider-Man PS4, GameRevolution’s Jason Faulkner has also played the game on PS5. This comes with enhancements like a 60 FPS performance mode, haptic feedback on the DualSense controller, and 3D audio.Short loading times are another big feature for PS5 players. However, they aren’t too offensive on PS4, despite the much slower storage drive. The fast travel system forces a load, but this only becomes a drag during collectible hunting with multiple fast travels in quick succession.I’m usually critical of 30 FPS, especially in action games, but Insomniac really knows what it is doing. The stability of the frame-rate helps make 30 FPS bearable, with motion blur giving the illusion of enhanced smoothness. Of course, 60 FPS would be better, and that is now an option for those playing on PS5.Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales has feature parity between PS4 and PS5, meaning players get the same content on both console. However, the game gains significant graphic and performance advantages on PS5.There are two graphics modes PS5 players can choose from:There are advantages to both of these modes. Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an excellent game to showcase ray-tracing. New York City really comes to life with real-time reflections, and the feature adds to the contrast between day and night gameplay. Seeing the sun or the screens of Times Square flickering off the glass is stunning.However, Performance mode showcases the fluidity of swinging through the city and gives a more visceral, fast-paced feel to combat. Switching between the two modes really shows the drawbacks of 30 vs. 60 FPS, with the quality of the game’s animations being much more noticeable in Performance mode.Luckily, the game has almost zero load time, so players can switch between the two modes practically at will. The only caveat is that it will set players back to the last checkpoint as the world reloads. Still, the game autosaves so often that this is a very minor annoyance.We suggest players mix and match between the two graphics modes to get the full effect. When swinging through the city and enjoying the sights, use Fidelity mode to drink in the beauty. Then, when fighting baddies in a more subdued environment, switch to Performance mode to enjoy the excellent animation and fluid fighting.Swinging around New York in 2018’s release felt incredible, and it’s just as good now. Insomniac has clearly put in the work to make Miles’ swing style more unique and his new combat abilities can also be used to gain additional height and speed while traversing the city. It doesn’t get old, even after tens of hours of collectible hunting across both games.The combat also matches the fluidity and intensity of its predecessor. It’s satisfying to work up a combo and deliver some justice with a big Finisher. There are plenty of new abilities to unlock and combine, too, which take Miles’ Spider-Man in a different direction to Peter’s. These moves greatly assist with crowd control so that Miles can focus on taking down the biggest threats first.I’ve died more than a handful of times while completing the main and side-missions, as powerful enemies are able to take Miles out pretty quickly on the Normal difficulty. Thankfully, there are five different difficulties and fantastic accessibility options beyond that. You can make the game much easier to play for those who might otherwise struggle, or much harder for those wannabe web-slingers.My biggest worry was that Miles and Peter would feel too similar, but Insomniac has done a good job differentiating them. Miles is also more powerful in certain ways, though he doesn’t make Peter’s version completely obsolete. I’m looking forward to hopefully switching between both characters in the presumed sequel or maybe even seeing co-op implemented in some way.Main missions offer a solid mix of traversal and combat, and I’m happy to say that forced non-hero stealth sections are gone from the campaign. Playing as non-hero Miles and Mary Jane wasn’t any fun in Spider-Man PS4, so I’m glad that’s been avoided here.Once the 7-9 hours of story missions are complete, it’s time for side content. As we saw with Spider-Man PS4, the New York map becomes littered with points of interest. This results in a lot of busywork for players wanting to 100% the game and/or hunt down the Platinum Trophy. If you liked doing it in the first game, then you’ll enjoy it here, too. I’m personally a fan of it, and Miles does give unique lines that expand the story each time he finds a collectible.There’s also New Game+, which is required to fully complete Miles’ skill tree. Skippable cutscenes aren’t consistently available, though, which can be a bit of a drag for repeat playthroughs.As a showpiece for the PS5, Spider-Man: Miles Morales delivers stunning visuals at 60 FPS with Performance Mode or enhanced 4K visuals with Fidelity Mode. It’s a safe choice for a great-looking, great-feeling title that plays superbly well and remains entertaining until the very end. It just doesn’t push the envelope as far as I would have liked, and I expect some of Insomniac’s crazier and braver ideas are being saved for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.For $50, players are getting 7-9 hours of story missions, combined with the optional 10+ hours of side content, much of which is collectible hunting. That doesn’t strike me as a great deal at launch, but the free upgrade from PS4 to PS5 does help soften the blow. When the price is right for you, this PlayStation exclusive comes with my recommendation, as it further bolsters Sony’s arsenal as we enter the next generation and beyond.Spider-Man: Miles Morales was reviewed on PS4 Pro with code provided by the publisher.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

As one of the most-anticipated games of its generation, Marvel’s Spider-Man for PS4 could have easily buckled under the weight of expectations and hype. Thankfully, the team at Insomniac games delivered one of the console’s standout titles and arguably the best superhero game ever made. Just over two years later, the team is back for another swing around New York City with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. This sequel carries a similar burden to its predecessor, needing to be a strong sequel as well as a showcase for Sony’s PS5. The results are generally outstanding, save for the occasional technical hiccup and absence of innovation.First off, Miles Morales is not an entirely new experience. It recycles the sprawling New York City map from the previous game, along with most of its gameplay mechanics and mission design. Returning fans will quickly slide back into the action and feel right at home. An apt comparison would be to Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the standalone follow up to 2016’s Uncharted 4 that reused mechanics and assets to tell a story with a different cast of protagonists. This time around, all the action is centered on young Miles Morales, a bright teenager who recently moved to Harlem with his mother following the death of his father and his acquisition of spider-esque superpowers. He is friendly with Peter Parker, who sees Morales as an apprentice to the mantle of Spider-Man. Because Peter is the ultimate simp and decides to follow Mary Jane Watson to Europe for a few weeks, the responsibilities that come with being Spider-Man fall directly onto the shoulders of Morales. As just about anyone could have predicted, chaos ensues and Miles must save his neighborhood almost single-handedly.While the open-world action takes Miles all over the city, most of the narrative focus is centered on Harlem and the evil corporation that aims to get rich providing energy from a stolen super-substance that they don’t fully understand. Along the way, Miles will also interact with the locals and help out where he can with lower-stakes objectives like rescuing bodega cats or recovering pigeons. I’d also like to shout out the wonderful use of licensed music this time around, as it helped improve immersion and worked to make Miles’ neighborhood plight feel more personal.Almost all gameplay and combat is identical to the previous game, though some alterations have been made. Morales has energy flowing through his body that is referred to as Venom and he gradually unlocks a series of attacks and maneuvers that unleash this energy. Lucky for Miles, these specific attacks are the only vulnerabilities that many of his tougher foes are susceptible to. Most encounters play out just like in the PS4 Spider-Man game, save for these Venom attacks.MIssion design is also nearly identical to the previous game with Morales having to deal with fixed numbers of thugs or soldiers to score a win. The optional open-world activities are also recycled with only slight variations on the existing formula. The suit unlock system, skill tree, and mods are all akin to how they worked before. Despite how much of the content is rehashed, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales manages to keep things feeling good thanks to its shorter main story and the overall strength of the foundation provided by the first game. Swinging through town still feels great, beating up people still feels great, and unlocking new Spider-Suits still feels rewarding. I found Miles to be a much more interesting protagonist than Peter Parker, even though the main story stubbornly remains faithful to some of the annoying Spider-Man character tropes.The PS5 version of the game comes with some visual upgrades over the previous offering and offers players two different modes to experience Morales' story: Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode. Performance Mode is visually closer to the PS4 game but offers the ability to run up to 60 frames per second. This makes just about everything you do in the game feel better due to lower input lag on the controller and the on-screen action is very smooth. Combat encounters in particular feel more satisfying because it feels like you are directly cracking skulls instead of watching animations play through. Fidelity Mode drops the frame rate to 30 but picks up better lighting, a depth of field effect, and ray-traced reflections. It certainly makes the experience look more next-gen, but the leap is not as large as it could be as the same models and textures from Performance Mode are still in use. Both modes are reconstructed from lower resolutions into a 4K output. As a hardware and graphics enthusiast, I was a bit let down that the visuals did not make a bigger jump, but this is still a cross-gen game and there is nothing here that adversely affects the enjoyment of the story. Further into the campaign, I started experiencing a series of stutters and hitches in performance in both modes, especially during open-world swinging. The longest freezes would sometimes last a full second and this continued through the end of the game. I would assume it is a bug that could be fixed but was disappointed nonetheless.Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will appeal to loads of gamers and I suspect it will be a hit for PlayStation owners this holiday season. While there isn’t as much to do this time around and what is included is mostly recycled, the asking price is lower than normal. Being Spider-Man is still as fun as it was in 2018 (and potentially more fun now at 60Hz) and Miles Morales is a character that is more compelling than Peter Parker. Should the few technical hiccups get sorted out, this will be a solid inclusion for any game library. Anyone grabbing a PS5 at launch would do well to grab a copy.Chris Jarrard likes playing games, crankin' tunes, and looking for fights on obscure online message boards.

					Reuses mostly everything from the first game with less to do, 8/10.I called it when I saw the first trailer. This is a DLC pack sold for $40.

					It looks great. If you’re going to build a huge world for a game, might as well get the most out of it.				
					It's £52.00 retail, I'm not sure Hearts of Stone retailed at that.				
					With how much I enjoyed Spider-Man, I'm okay with this.  I'll take it to go back and play some more but with PS5 upgrades. I'm sure we'll get a true sequel in a few years.				
					Were we expecting the game to be in Atlanta? 				
					Gotham.				
					People just lose me every time they call it DLC, by all accounts it’s still longer than any Uncharted game, if you are the type of person that needs 50 hours out of a game, that’s not this but that doesn’t make it DLC 				
					I thought it was $50?				
					But does it have its own Stan Lee cameo?				"
