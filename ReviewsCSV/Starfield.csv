Eurogamer,"Liminal space.
Starfield does not begin well. You start this game of space and exploration in an elevator, trundling down through walls of rock to a subterranean mining tunnel. In this one early place Bethesda always likes to keep things tightly coordinated, characters delivering their programmed line of dialogue to you without looking up from their job as rock-shooter and drill-watcher. It's all so precisely on cue, as you walk by, that they feel a little like animatronics on a Disneyland dark ride, the echoes of that same line faintly echoing down the corridor as the next tour boat bobs along past Captain Jack Sparrow. 

Your tour guide, mining supervisor Lin, eventually leads you to a deeper tunnel, where you're told a little bluntly to go and pick up something giving off a weird gravitational signal from the deep. This is an Artifact, a mysterious lump of scrap metal, and it teleports you, via seizure-slash-religious-experience, to the character creator. 

Clunky as it sounds, absolutely none of this stuff is a problem. In fact really, it's actually classic Bethesda, and much as I'm being a little harsh about the cave puppets' patter I am more than on board with this part: it's the run-up to arguably the best moment of any Bethesda RPG, the ""walkout moment"", where our typically wordless chosen one begins somewhere dark and claustrophobic - the sewers beneath Cyrodiil's Imperial City, the prison escape through the caves of Skyrim, the vaults of Fallout (so apt, when you think about it, it's almost like that whole series was conceived before Bethesda even had rights to it, just for the studio to have the perfect walkout scenario) - only to emerge out into the grand expanse. 

Typically that expanse is something of a showpiece. In The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion it's the beckoning, almost painfully verdant glow of its Ayleid ruin-speckled countryside; in Skyrim the rolling, Pacific Northwest-meets-Scandinavia mix of pine forests and ravines at the region's southern edge. This is what Bethesda does best, basically - and as you can probably tell, I love it. Herein lies the problem: contrast that moment of wondrously blunt juxtaposition, of radical confinement and radical freedom, an unceremonious birthing into a world of peerless possibility, with Starfield, where you burst forth from your grey-brown mining shaft to... a concrete landing pad. Your first view of the wider world is the grey-brown non-place of the planet Argos, the sci-fi equivalent of a car park by an industrial estate off the M4. After a little scuffle here on the outskirts of space-Croydon, it's a fast-travel jump into a largely static tutorial sequence in orbit. 

This is Starfield at its worst, one of the handful of uncharacteristic stumbles Bethesda makes delivering its usual sense of wonder, and one example of many small, strange decisions the mega-studio has made that obstruct its own uncanny ability to conjure real video game magic. In this case, I suspect it's because Starfield has just too many systems happening, in too many places, for it to provide one clean route to a totally hands-off release into the world. You need a tutorial for mining, and you need a tutorial for combat, and a tutorial for planetary exploration, and a tutorial for space combat, and a tutorial for space navigation, and on and on. I suspect that's also the reason for many of the game's more major snags. But it's not the totality of this game - neither its only type of problem, nor the only thing to take from a game that is also, regularly, a marvel. It's too big, too oddly shaped and uncooperative, to let you squeeze it down into one summary without falling into reductivity and vagueness.

One attempt, and an understandable one, would be to try and pin Starfield as effectively just a Bethesda RPG in space. Star-rim, Space-blivion, Fallout 2330. That would be mostly but not entirely accurate. In Starfield you can, like those games, entirely ignore the main quest after the first couple of hours to go noodle about on the edges of the known universe, building outposts to help you farm vegetables, mine resources or scan alien slugs. You can take on typically combat-focused encounters with a range of approaches, immersive sim style, by sneaking through undetected or picking grunts off one by one, or lockpicking your way through side doors or pickpocketing keys into control rooms to turn robots on their masters. Or potentially even talking enemies around through persuasion. Or bribing a few conveniently-placed mercenaries to help you out if things turn sour. 

Crucially, you can also play with Starfield's astonishing physics, with oceans of potatoes and milk cartons taking on the memeified role here that the avalanching cheese wheels and sweetrolls played in Skyrim - but much more interestingly, actual gameplay scenarios arise from them at times too. Starfield is another ""bucket on the head"" game, like Bethesda's previous RPGs, that odd and, to me, once-accidental but now clearly deliberate kind of warped game logic working towards something ingenious. It has the same elaborate system of in-universe rules, the bucket scenario being the reliance on sight lines that means an NPC seeing you commit a crime alerts them, but placing that bucket on their head - something that would, I reckon, typically alert a guard to potential foul play in the real world - and then committing that same crime right next to them, doesn't.The effect is an entire universe of playthings. NPCs as dolls, not animatronic puppets, and Starfield's incalculable amount of bric-a-brac their accessories all there to be toyed with, tossed about, punted off ledges or blasted high into the air in zero-G. In many cases, especially sidequests or optional enemy outposts free from the main story's rigid narrative outcomes - and especially at much higher levels where more abilities are available to meld together in Starfield's bubbling physics cauldron - it means many of the game's limits come down to your own imagination (or, as in my case, lack thereof).

In line with Bethesda tradition again, those sidequests are where Starfield is at its absolute best. It being some time after launch now, you'll likely have already heard about the brilliance of The Mantis, the zero-G gunfights, or one of my favourites involving a ship that left Earth 200 years ago, before the invention of faster-than-light travel, with plans to save humanity by colonising a new world, only to rock up now with humanity cracking on just fine. The genius of that one lies in how Bethesda avoided the straight-ahead approach of zeroing in on all the tragedy and philosophy, and instead had them arrive at a luxury resort planet, the type of place where the galaxy's wealthiest can get a two-for-one deal on reconstructive surgery on their way in and out, to ensure what happens there, stays there. It's a wonderful setup, like a bunch of slightly pompous Victorians spending centuries adrift self-propagating on the Cutty Sark, only to arrive and find their promised land is now an all-inclusive on Mykonos.

Again, the Bethesda formula is plain here - quite remarkably plain in fact. In Starfield there are two main regional factions (Bethesda loves factions) with tense relations after a not-too-distant war. Each also has its own police force, both of which you can join at will for a series of largely interesting, often wonderfully silly quests, like a turn as a secret informant, or a run through a blood-sport gauntlet. There are crime syndicates with their own lines, corporations with theirs, two rivalling religions and a third typically-barmy cult that worships a giant snake. There's a system of bounties, jail, and fines. There are outposts with patrolling guards, subterranean dungeons in the form of abandoned research facilities - oh so many abandoned research facilities. Go into any bar and you'll be relieved to know that 300 years into the future, the archetypal RPG tavern is still alive and well: start asking around and you'll end up with threads of gossip that inevitably turn to quests. Some are comically simple, like one that's literally fetching an NPC a coffee that happens to be from the entire other side of town, clearly a means of getting you to explore the first settlement you arrive in (but, I'm praying, hopefully also a kind of inside joke about fetch-quests in big RPGs? Though going by the number of additional fetch-quests, that may be a little generous). At every corner a quest-giver lies at the ready, hat tipped over their eyes, strange accent equipped, game attitude primed for role-play.

Even in the MacGuffin-hunting, do-gooding secret society of Constellation, the weirdly adulating group of nerds that sends you out from their clubhouse to all corners of the settled systems in Starfield's main questline, you have an almost direct application of The Elder Scrolls' Blades. If the greatness of a Bethesda RPG comes from its network of faction quests, play areas and physics systems, we've got Sky-field through and through. In reality, however, it doesn't - there is a final piece missing from the equation here, and it's a big one. 

The great Bethesda RPGs are about exploration and discovery. It's the indescribable webbing of their games that brings the physics and the factions and the playgrounds together and enables them to work as one - the grey matter, the quantum entanglement, the heavy whisking that binds essential elements to form a kind of cosmic emulsion. Maybe that doesn't work. Put it another way: play Skyrim for a while and you'll realise you are really only ever in two modes - doing, or roaming. ""Doing"" generally applies to ticking things off. So in Skyrim's case: ""today I want to power through this Stormcloak questline to get that off my slate,"" you might say to yourself. ""Now I'm going to bash out a few Dwemer ruins and run the loop of looting metal, smelting it, and crafting armour, just to get myself up to the level of making my own Dragonbone gear, then I can start on the DLC."" Starfield has loads of doing.

""Roaming"" is the opposite of that - or maybe the absence of it - and also certainly all the moments in-between. It's Bethesda's most fertile ground, where it plants memories that, for one reason or another, just seem to stick. The long hike through snowy peaks between Dawnstar and Winterhold, where the wind lifts just in time with the mournful choirs of the score; the time a giant smacks a bandit and breaks the physics a little, sending him a mile or two up into the air. The temptation, from a symbol just at the edge of your compass, poking out of peripheral vision, of a Daedric shrine along a winding commute - or the opposite, the looming, intimidating dread of what you know will be a massive dungeon. It goes beyond the ""see that mountain over there"" quotes - and the astonishment of when you realise you really can walk all the way there, uninterrupted, for the first time. It's the stillness, the wind between the trees, the mixture of tasks and freedom, action and inaction, space and negative space, that does just as much to give a Bethesda world its still unmatched sense of life as the studio's astonishing clockwork engineering of people and planets in motion.

Starfield doesn't have it. It doesn't have surprises along the road, memories of journeys and distractions, a sense of artfully-engineered, perfectly positioned distraction and discovery, like each shrine was hand-placed by Video Game God, because it is both entirely disconnected and, frequently when you do roam about on a planet surface, procedurally generated. In Starfield the planets aren't entire regions, they're fixed cities with random land around them. You can't be lured off the road, or simply on the road to drink in the world, because there is quite literally no road to be lured away from. There's no route from one planet or system to the next. In Starfield, instead, you fast travel everywhere.It's a topic that's led to much discussion of loading screen waits and broken immersion, the sense of disappointment mostly forming around not being able to seamlessly land a spaceship and take off like you'd hoped. And that's a fair point, but also a failure to really capture what's lost when you cut out manual exploration entirely. Instead of roaming discovery, Starfield's world is navigated by hypertext, flitted through in an instant like a Wikipedia article with all the formless liminality of the internet but without the art of, say, Hypnospace Outlaw or Neurocracy, which actually makes a game of that on purpose. 
The result - aside from losing all those sacred in-between moments - is a kind of total disorientation and detachment, a radical alienation and a saddening kind of ennui. In the literal sense, I rarely have the faintest idea where I am in this game. This is because I don't need to - you pick up a quest marker, bring up the menu, press the button to take you directly to whatever planet you need to visit, press another button and pachow, with a whoosh and a bang and, depending on your hard drive, a loading screen or five, you're there. Got the object? Killed the guy? Spoken to the farmer or shopkeeper or whatever? Blam, another whip through the buttons and you're back. 
I've been playing Starfield every day for weeks and couldn't tell you the location - or to be honest, the even name - of a single system outside of Sol and Alpha Centauri, and only those two because I know we live in one right now, and the other's close enough for Sid Meier to make a Civ game about it. (I do also know where the Wolf system is, now I think about it - but also because it's right next to those two, has a cool name, and because I spent a good 10 minutes scrubbing the starmap for it while searching for a place to sell my contraband.) I haven't played Oblivion for some time, but I could point to Kvatch or Cheydinhal on a map at the drop of a hat.

Even putting the metaphysical sense of displacement aside, there's also a quite literal one to wrestle with. Humans are in a way homeless in Starfield's version of the future, an interesting narrative angle that's ripe for some of its better moments of storytelling, but one that combines with Starfield's lack of actual journey-making to leave you feeling unanchored, adrift, lost. The exploration that you do embark on meanwhile is a dirge. For a game that has a main story - and a big, central theme, that seeps through its score, its dialogue, its lore - dedicated to exploration, the exploration itself is dreadful. 

Take travelling on foot, for instance, which is the only way to get about on any planet, apart from the loading screen trains of Alpha Centauri. This is a reminder of the worst parts of classic Bethesda - the outdated over-gamification of stamina from the likes of Morrowind - where you're constantly looking at your Oxygen and CO2 gauge in the bottom-left and your jump-pack metre in the bottom-right (maybe you're over-encumbered as well, as a treat). Stamina bars have always been present in these games but here they matter because, land on a planet, and you'll find the only things of interest - besides the objective you fast-travelled there for - are absolutely miles away. The cycle is: fast travel to planet, load into procedurally-generated area, observe the washed-out, characterless, almost unanimously ugly surroundings for a distant map marker (and I use ugly for a reason; Starfield's environmental ugliness on most planet surfaces is the ugliness of machines, the authorless sludge of generative AI-art), and run for five minutes in a straight line. If you're lucky, another procedural event might pop up - a ship lands, normally also miles away, or an enemy alien attacks - but that's it. Scan a big lump of space-metal or clear out a few space-bandits, loot what you can find, fast-travel back to your ship (god forbid I do that walk again) and move on.

Discovery meanwhile - the other half of exploration - is also handled differently here. Quests are almost unanimously brute-forced into your inventory through overheard dialogue - usually something you didn't even clock yourself, thanks to Starfield's knack for getting multiple NPCs babbling at once - or through hails from other ships when you arrive (from fast-travel) into another planet's orbit. Bethesda RPGs always do this a bit - heard about the Grey Fox? - but have also always been a treasure hunt, a kind of sifting through busywork dirt for sidequest gold, as you take on some odd jobs or follow hand-scrawled notes in the hope they turn into something truly weird. And this stuff, crucially, is ultimately found by getting out there on foot. In Starfield, where the lack of hand-placed land to walk on means quests must predominantly arrive by interruption, it's closer to an escape room with all its clues pre-marked by waypoint, and an overzealous guide on the intercom who keeps bludgeoning you with hints before you've even looked behind your first suspicious painting. 

There are, unfortunately, also just a lot of quite strange decisions in Starfield. Astonishingly, there is no ground map to speak of whatsoever, even in long-established towns, only helping you to feel constantly disorientated and untethered from the world around you. The claim, from Todd Howard, that Starfield would be closer to its more classical, hardcore RPGs seems to be entirely detached from what I played. Starfield would include ""some things we didn't do [in more recent Bethesda games]: the backgrounds, the traits, defining your character, all of those stats,"" he said in 2022, but its RPG elements, at least in terms of things like traits and stats, are the loosest they've ever been.Starfield's character creator has some absolutely impressive faces and inclusive options, and you can injest some concoctions that get you moving comically fast, which is reminiscent of Bethesda's old-school silliness, but this is still the opposite of a deep RPG setup. In fact Starfield's at least one step closer to ""RPG-lite"" than Skyrim was: your three traits give you a somewhat gimmicky perk, like the Adoring Fan following you around or a bounty that makes some enemies very occasionally turn up at random, while backgrounds provide a single skill point in three areas that you can earn within minutes of getting started. No sign of governing attributes like the Bethesda RPGs of old. Those skills can get interesting - occasionally very interesting, when combined - but not until far too late in the game, in the region of dozens or even scores of hours after you start. By this point your chosen traits are a distant memory, or a mere annoyance you paid to get rid of for just a couple thousand credits.

The little issues go on. There's far too much time spent in menus - far too much time - and they are finicky, at least on controller, with weird hitches around having to do an extra step like manually undocking your ship from another before performing a grav jump, making two cutscenes out of one. By Microsoft's standards in particular, Starfield's accessibility options are awful and, for a game reportedly delayed for a year for polish, without excuse.Its ""NASA-punk"" aesthetic, meanwhile, leads to some quite frankly stunning buttons, switches, knobs, screens, and control-panels, along with the finest selection of doors I've ever seen in a game and an all-round stellar job of spaceship and space-station interiors. These games come bundled with thousands upon thousands of worker hours baked into their world - never mind the thousands of planets - to such a degree it leaves me wanting to single out every person who dedicated years to getting just the right beep-boop out of a computer, or scribbling hand-drawn notes pinned to walls about using the right USB-Z port, getting the shadows looking right on some space pirate's bridge you might never enter, all so this universe can come to life. But compared to all that utterly lavish detail in Starfield's interiors, its planetary surfaces are desperately bland, and its settlements often feel like facsimiles of other places that have done it better.

The Freestar Collective's yeehaw Akila City, for instance, could be straight from Fallout; Neon is a smaller Night City in the middle of a near-barren ocean; New Atlantis is shooting for the ""society if..."" meme template of a utopian future, mixed with a bit of Starship Troopers satire, but lands somewhere closer to concept art of Neom, that impossibly air-conditioned, crypto-bro investor trap the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's trying to build in the middle of the desert. The thousands of blank NPCs named simply ""Citizen"", who exist without purpose, make its towns feel like the pop-up facades of more recent Pokémon. In character design, it often lands closer to normcore than anything vaguely punk, with it all being a bit Harrison Ford in Blade Runner 2049, who - admirably! Honestly I respect him for it - clearly didn't fancy the whole plastic raincoats and big collars vibe and just rocked up on set in jeans and a grey T-shirt. 

Starfield's story, through the main quest, involves a neat twist on the New Game+ formula and a clever reworking of Bethesda's typical ""chosen one"" beat, but it also falls back on its old habits of getting you to collect a load of the same object (nowhere near as bad as Oblivion did, mercifully) and relies far too much on people standing around telling you how momentous something is, rather than using scenario or consequence or style to make something feel momentous. The obsession with NASA can feel oddly fawning, and the take on the future - while it's completely understandable to simplify, rather than somehow include the entire world's range of cultures and complexities - is entirely, almost comically US-focused, with no languages or religions carried into the stars, a freedom-versus-union culture war, and not a peep about anyone else's space agencies. 

At times, all this obsession with accurate physics that brings about Starfield's most marvellous feats of video game engineering (gravity dictated by planetary locations; local time by the tilts of their axes; those impossible mounds of potatoes), over any deeper engagement with actual human culture, can make Starfield feel like a vision of the future where the STEM kids won the tongue-in-cheek war with the humanities. A kind of playable Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet.

If I were being truly harsh, I could pick up on how many of Starfield's most interesting quests, despite absolutely being interesting, are references to other science fiction tales from the likes of Star Trek or Aliens, rather than creations of its own. Other references are made to older Bethesda games that, without context, can occasionally land as slightly tired jokes, the Adoring Fan one example that just doesn't hit the same on the second telling. Although, absolutely not all of them: the return of another standout Oblivion voice actor is wonderful, with a subtler, more subversive, and as a result much funnier reference thrown in at the end of that questline.

Many of these issues - and hands up, I am admittedly speculating wildly - must surely be down to Starfield's scale. Without it there wouldn't be the need for so many procedural filler activities from quest terminals, so much time in the menus, so much fast travel. The reality, I suspect, is the more you expand in game development and the more you can include, the more likely people are to notice what you didn't include, in the same way you hit upon the uncanny valley with near-real visuals. The harder something tries to replicate the real world the easier it becomes to point out those omissions that would, otherwise, be suspensions of disbelief. In the moments where Starfield clicks, that suspension is entirely possible, the immersion of the immersive sim returns, and Starfield's systemic magic feels as good as it ever has in a Bethesda game, only even prettier and more elaborate. 
Subtitles (general and dialogue), large menu font toggle, viewable and remappable controls, iron sights toggle, motion blur toggle, five difficulty settings, separate audio volume sliders.
But the moments where it doesn't are too frequent, and in those there's a sense that this elaborate, clockwork universe has been built without anything human to give it purpose. There's even a scientist, in one of Starfield's many audio logs, that sums this up quite perfectly, using an impossibly powerful supercomputer just to recreate the sound of all the world's ducks quacking in unison. He's fascinated by this, despite his supervisor explaining they have the supercomputer precisely so they can work on the most meaningful research in the history of humankind.In this world, this mode of thinking that Bethesda occasionally seems to slip into with Starfield where its ambition overrides its purpose, the technical capability is the game - 10,000 milk cartons modded into space! Look what it can do! - but this is not a world I think Bethesda should be aiming to build, unless we want our games to play like that Matrix tech demo for Unreal Engine 5. Technology for technology's sake, or scale for the sake of scale, is a trap. In video games like any other medium, the technical craft, however exquisite, exists to serve meaning, not to be it. In Bethesda games in particular that meaning comes in the form of a deep submersion into new worlds, via the studio's ability to create a famously unparalleled, impossibly absorbing sense of place. Note, for a blunt example, the way Bethesda's games are typically named after their settings, over their people. Starfield's problem is its lack of one. It's a non-place, formless, joined entirely by menu screens and hyperlinks replacing the almost divine sensation of direct experience. Rather than being built in service of presentness and a sense of place, Starfield is set entirely in their absence.

Link: Official siteThe more I've played Starfield, the more I've liked it, and for the same reasons I enjoy Bethesda's other RPG sandboxes. The fun collision between structured quests and unpredictable systems creates moments that feel more personal and memorable than those of many other games.It took me a while to find that fun, though. Starfield's introduction is unusually straightforward for a Bethesda RPG, and the first handful of places you visit, including the game's capital city of New Atlantis, are pretty dull. It took about a dozen hours before I started really enjoying it, but after rolling credits on the main quest with one character and ignoring that quest to become an aspiring drug kingpin with another, I can finally say that, in the end, I like Starfield.But I don't love Starfield. And that's genuinely disappointing because with the exception of Fallout 76, I've loved each of Bethesda's RPGs since 2006's Oblivion. I've spent hundreds of hours in those games and still invent new excuses just to spend more time in their worlds, like roleplaying an NPC in Skyrim for weeks and seeing how long I could play Fallout 4 without leaving the starting settlement of Sanctuary. Starfield is Bethesda's biggest RPG ever, and it shares even more DNA with Skyrim and Fallout 4 than I expected—but it ultimately falls far short of the greatness of both of those games. The main companions lack personality, quests that have promising starts frequently come to disappointing conclusions, and space exploration fails to feel like a grand adventure. I liked a lot of what I experienced in Starfield, and it's as huge as promised, but it's not the epic space adventure I was hoping for.Bethesda RPGs have a history of awesome opening sequences: the assassination plot and escape through the sewers in Oblivion, living through your entire childhood in Fallout 3, and of course the iconic wagon trip to your execution in Skyrim. So it's almost startling how straightforward Starfield's opener is. My space-folks eventually became one of my favorite parts of Starfield.It's the year 2330 and humankind has colonized the galaxy, and you're a miner on a distant planet who finds a mysterious artifact during your first day on the job. Then things happen quickly: you shoot some pirates, learn to fly a spaceship, and meet a few explorers who are part of a group called Constellation, looking to find more artifacts like yours. I kept waiting for some ""wow"" moment that would make the tutorial feel less like a tutorial, but the only surprising thing about my introduction to Starfield was that it didn't contain any surprises.The next handful of hours were similarly underwhelming. I carefully explored the blandly futuristic city of New Atlantis, its generic sci-fi skyscrapers looking like something you'd see in the background in a Star Trek movie. I took off and landed on the randomly generated terrain of a few planets, walked around peering at alien critters and mineral formations and randomly placed research labs filled with angry space raiders, then flew back to the city feeling unimpressed by what I'd found.The first few companions of Constellation I met were disappointing, too: a pleasant man, a pleasant woman, and another pleasant man. They were all extremely nice and agreeable, but that's not really what I'm looking for in a follower. Where were the weirdos Bethesda is so good at creating? Where were Starfield's versions of Nick Valentine, or Cicero, or Curie? Even Vasco the robot is kind of a bore—wait, didn't Bethesda used to be great at making entertaining robots?Starfield guide: Our hub of advice

First it was via the traits I'd chosen during character creation. One trait gave me parents, a retired middle-aged mom and dad, with the downside that I had to support them with a weekly cash allowance. At first my folks were simply sweet and supportive—impressed with my new job at Constellation, telling me they'd heard about some of my exploits on the news—but later they began popping up unexpectedly and hilariously in places you wouldn't expect to see your aging parents.

My space-folks eventually became one of my favorite parts of Starfield as they had their own little adventure in the background of my bigger one, and their cameos around the galaxy were never pinpointed with a quest marker—particularly refreshing for a Bethesda game. Plus, it's funny that they're cruising around the stars on my dime. Just that single trait (and you can pick up to three in character creation) added more to my character's experience than any of Cyberpunk 2077's disappointing ""lifepaths"" did.I was also relieved to finally meet an interesting Constellation companion, Andreja. She still wasn't on par with earlier Bethesda RPG followers and the romance didn't exactly give me butterflies, but her complicated, slowly revealed past and an excellent performance by actor Cissy Jones made me fond of her just the same. Most importantly, traveling with Andreja buffed my stealth and pickpocketing skills, and when I shoved a bunch of extra weapons into her inventory because they were too heavy for me to carry, she selected a massive gatling gun to wield as her primary. Now that's romantic as hell.While New Atlantis didn't impress me, there are better settlements out there. Akila City is a rustic Wild West town on an untamed planet—with muddy streets and busy saloons it's a bit like the town of Valentine from Red Dead Redemption 2 got launched into space. A crusty old marshal in a leather duster enlisted me to deal with a bank robbery the moment I moseyed into town—who better to help him negotiate a tense hostage situation with heavily armed outlaws than a complete stranger?Plenty of shootouts, a couple of fugitive hunts, and a big bad guy who needed to be toppled, just like in any good Western.After I solved his problem by failing to negotiate and succeeding to shoot everyone, I quickly signed up to be a space ranger in the Freestar Collective—they're basically space cops but at least I got to wear a cool hat. And that kicked off a series of faction quests beginning with a classic western premise: a humble farmer being run off their land by hired thugs. It was a long and enjoyable series of connected quests leading through some cool sci-fi environments like a huge mech graveyard and a mining operation inside a crystal-filled asteroid. There were plenty of shootouts, a couple of fugitive hunts, and a big bad guy who needed to be toppled, just like in any good Western. It also introduced some lore to a universe that so far had felt severely lacking in it, as anger and bitterness over a war long past came bubbling to the surface.While I was enjoying being a space cowboy, I was also enduring the main story quests, which mostly involve the gathering of more artifacts. Those missions could sometimes be interesting, such as when one artifact had already been found by an eccentric collector who had turned his massive starship into a museum of oddities and wasn't willing to part with his favorite exhibit. The main quest also eventually introduced a recurring enemy who I slowly realized functions like Skyrim's dragons—a high-level menace who randomly turns up when you're trying to get other things done, leading to a fight that's pretty much always the same. It may not be a dragon this time, but it's definitely a drag.More disappointing is a surprisingly repetitive collection of main quests to visit a series of ancient temples, missions that are so similar in format it feels like Bethesda just copy-pasted them onto different planets. There's almost nothing to them: land on a planet, run for a few minutes in a straight line to reach the temple, then go inside and do the same thing you did in the last one. The rewards are different and occasionally quite good (yes, I'm being deliberately vague), but these temple quests are interesting exactly once, the very first time, and then become the definition of a mindless chore.Movement in Starfield is majorly improved over earlier Bethesda games.At least the story of the main quest is a creative one. When I first learned Starfield was about finding mysterious ancient artifacts buried deep inside planets, I figured I knew how it would end up, and I'm happy to say I was completely wrong (and even happier to say that pretty much everyone posting story theories on Reddit is also completely wrong). The story of Starfield's main quest genuinely surprised me on more than one occasion (to be precise: two occasions) and being surprised is never a bad thing. The conclusion of the main quest also gives rise, quite brilliantly, to Starfield's New Game+, allowing you to retain your character and skills while starting over from the beginning in a way that makes perfect sense within the game's logic.I talked my way out of a lot of jams in Starfield—I even managed to peacefully settle the very last face-off of the main story quest—but it's also got the longest, biggest battles I can remember in a Bethesda RPG. Luckily, the shooting felt just as good as it did in Fallout 4 (minus VATS) and I came across so many guns I liked that I had trouble fitting them all in my radial menu. Early on I found a pistol that ignores armor completely, making it feel like a cheat code that ends fights early (especially once I ranked up my pistol skill a few times) and a rifle that does more damage with each successful hit, forming the best incentive for never missing a shot. I have a bullpup that occasionally does radioactive damage, a sniper rifle that does double damage against a target with full health, and a laser pistol I'd love to see the patent for because it somehow causes its victims to drop more health kits than they normally would. I dabbled a bit with weapon modding, which is quite similar to Fallout 4's tinkering system, but it hardly seemed worth it due to the number and variety of guns I found already randomly outfitted with mods and attachments.Despite cruising from one end of the galaxy to the other in Starfield, I never really felt like I was going anywhere. Complementing my arsenal is my boostpack, which lets me launch into the air during combat, and the lower the gravity on the planet I'm on, the higher and faster I can boost. Ambushed by serpent-worshiping fanatics or enormous angry space roaches? No problem. Just launch 20 feet straight up into the air and fire down at the top of their heads. (Enemies and companions can boost, too, but only a little here and there. You're basically the Dragonborn of jetpacks.) In general, movement in Starfield is majorly improved over earlier Bethesda games, especially since your character will grab ledges, corners, tree branches, and nearly anything else you collide with so you can mantle yourself up and over catwalks, rooftops, spaceships, or most anything in your way. Someone ought to mod Starfield's movement system into Skyrim: you could clamber up to High Hrothgar in under a minute.Sapping a bit of my enthusiasm for being a helpful star-hopping cowboy was the star-hopping itself. I never expected Starfield to be the sort of fully open-ended spaceship sim Elite Dangerous is, or for it to replicate the freedom of flight in No Man's Sky, but it's hard not to feel like there's something missing here. I never felt excitement or awe, no goosebumps as my engines fired, no sense of grandeur as I set down on a new world. That's because, despite cruising from one end of the galaxy to the other in Starfield, I never felt like I was really going anywhere. Click a star on a galaxy map and it'll show you a solar system. Click a planet and it'll zoom in. Click the planet's moon to zoom in again, click the spot you'd like to land (anywhere but the ocean), then watch a cutscene of yourself landing. Space travel, docking, boarding, and getting onto and off your ship is a series of cutscenes, black screens, and loading screens. Even though that's more or less what I was expecting, it still feels underwhelming. For anyone hoping for passenger or cargo missions, there are some but they're pretty unsatisfying since they can be completed with a few simple clicks. As the hours pass, travel starts to feel somehow both too fast (I clicked a location on the map and now I'm already standing on it?) and too slow (do I really have to watch the same docking cutscene every single time I visit a space station?).Then there's all those planets and moons themselves. My incendiary take on Starfield's 1,000+ planets after years of anticipation? They're fine. I don't know how else to describe it: exploring Starfield's planets is... fine. Many are dull, lifeless orbs, as you'd expect to find in a semi-realistic galaxy. Others are genuinely lovely and my first order of business was to drop a beacon so I could build a base there. Most star systems have at least one planet with abundant plant life and alien critters skittering, stomping, or flapping around, and even barren worlds have points of interest scattered across the segment of the planet you land in.Some of those points can be vaguely interesting, like a huge fungal forest (and the bodies of some careless botanists who visited them without helmets on), the remnants of a stunningly large industrial outpost, a massive jagged upheaval of ice or a towering rock structure that just about makes it worthwhile to run for a thousand uneventful meters across the surface of the planet to take a photo of. Thing is, these sights are interesting the first time, but not so much the fifth time.What's really missing in Starfield's planetary exploration is what happens in other Bethesda RPGs: You head out toward your destination and get completely distracted along the way: meeting an NPC, hearing a nearby dispute, stumbling onto a new quest, and never quite getting the place you intended to without finding in a half-dozen new things to add to your to-do list. You get some of that in Starfield's cities, and occasionally you'll pick up a signal or be hailed by another ship when entering the orbit of a planet, but not while exploring the surface of a planet itself.One saving grace to the act of cutscening across the galaxy is that Starfield's spaceships are cool, stylish inside and out, and often surprisingly huge. I only wish I had more reason to spend real time inside my ship. When crossing the galaxy just takes a few clicks of a mouse, it doesn't make sense to hang out in my ship's interior, with all its compartments and modules and ladders (yes, Bethesda finally got ladders working).The only really good use of my ship—and one of the best parts of Starfield altogether—is disabling an enemy ship in orbit without destroying it completely, and then boarding it. Then you get to stalk through the enemy ship, compartment by compartment, level by level, engaging in close-quarters combat with scores of enemies and sometimes even automated defenses. It's a rush, with each ship feeling like a deadly, tightly-designed maze, with the bonus being that if you like the ship you've raided you can add it to your fleet.I've always found the real joy of Bethesda's RPGs to be not the main story or official quests but the sandbox itself, the freedom to come up with your own goals and aspirations. So after about 75 hours I retired my helpful artifact-collecting space ranger and created a second character with the goal of completely ignoring the main quest. Once free of the tutorial I headed straight to Neon, a densely populated and gritty cyberpunk city on an ocean planet, a place packed with gangs, addicts, shady operatives, and crooked security guards. The perfect place to start a life of crime.Starfield is letting me write my own personal crime story, one that's already entertaining me more than most of the official questlines have.I immediately wormed my way into the criminal underworld when I saw a drug smuggler being arrested: before long I'd met his boss and had his job, and began making illegal drug shipments myself. Between drug runs I became a low-level operative for mega-corporation Ryujin Industries, dabbling in corporate skullduggery and industrial espionage while still sidelining as petty drug mule.And while skulking through a nightclub on a sanctioned operation, I happened to notice the city's crime boss (my boss's boss) standing with his back to me. I slithered up behind him, pickpocketed his penthouse key, then found his ritzy home, let myself in, and burglarized his safe and valuables. After visiting all the shopkeepers in Neon I eventually found a fence who buys stolen property and unloaded everything I'd stolen, making a nice pile of credits on top of the shady quest I was already getting paid for.Encouraged by that success, I've begun my own freeform crime operation. As a part of my work as a mule I learned the formula to synthesize a popular drug, so I'm now in the midst of building an offworld drug manufacturing base, scouring the galaxy for moons and planets that will let me extract the particular chemicals I need. It's the first step in my personal mission to become the Walter White of space meth. There's no quest marker for that, it's just something I want to do. I've even hired a bodyguard, a new companion I spotted in a Neon nightclub who has weapon skills to compliment my stealth and who won't gripe about the murders I commit the way Constellation members do. This is what Bethesda RPGs excel at, giving you a sandbox to imagine and complete your own person main quests, and even just a dozen hours in as my petty crook, Starfield is letting me write my own personal crime story, one that's already entertaining me more than most of the official questlines have.Part of me was hoping Starfield's long years of development and 10-month delay would lead to a more polished experience. Nah. There's as much Bethesda jank on display in Starfield as there ever was. Most of it is harmless and occasionally comical: speak to someone while they're mid-stride and they'll often continue shuffling along while they talk, taking one slow, faltering step at a time, until they've walked almost all the way down a corridor or around a corner during the conversation. I stood watching a guy in a restaurant slowly drift through the table and chair and eventually through the back wall. Every single city I visit has one member of the security team dressed only in their underwear. (Or maybe that's not a glitch and they just take Casual Friday very seriously in the future.)Starfield is plenty janky and a bit buggy, but I also found it extremely stable.In terms of genuine, irritating bugs that get in the way of the playing, I didn't have all that many (this isn't a Cyberpunk 2077 launch situation, in other words). One space pirate got wedged behind the scenery on a space station, meaning I had to enable cheats to clip through a wall and finish him off to satisfy the quest. On two different occasions I was midway through a persuasion minigame when the companions of the person I was attempting to charm simply opened fire, even on successive reloads. I also had a few quest marker goofs where they pointed to the wrong location or didn't appear at all, typically solved by a restart, and one side quest refuses to advance even though it's pretty clear there's another part to it. On the plus side, in 90 hours of play I only had a single crash to desktop and a few loading screens that went on much longer than they should have. Starfield is plenty janky and a bit buggy, but I also found it extremely stable.The systems you use almost constantly are also lacking: maps, minigames, and inventory.  If you visit a planet and want to return later, there's no way to bookmark it on the star map (other than planting a base beacon on it, though you have a limited number of those) so I'd advise taking notes while you play. The inventory system is truly rotten, frustrating in a game where you're collecting anything and everything and trying to shuffle items between your companion, your ship's inventory, your storage crates at your base, and your own pockets. I have some not-minor minigame gripes as well: lockpicking is simply a puzzle game now—in earlier Bethesda games it at least felt like using tools to play around inside a lock's mechanism. And while I'm glad there's a persuasion system, it's not a good one: you basically pick from a few options and hope the hidden dice rolls are in your favor. Bizarrely, there are no local city maps at all, and in a big city like New Atlantis or Neon, that makes finding what you're looking for, sometimes even when it's marked with a quest icon, pretty exasperating.After all the hype and hope and anticipation, I'm disappointed to say I don't love Starfield the way I love other Bethesda RPGs. It's similar in a lot of ways, but Starfield never feels as instantly engrossing and transporting as Oblivion or Skyrim or as wild and weird as the Fallout games. It comes close on occasion: one settlement on a far-flung planet is right up there with the most entertaining Vault-Tec experiments of all time. But more often the promising premises I found in remote bases or mysterious space stations tended to fizzle out. Starfield's alien bugs, even the truly monstrous ones, don't hold a candle to Skyrim's menagerie of beasts, faction quests never match the intrigue and brilliance of Oblivion's guild quests, and though Starfield's ""spacers"" and Fallout's raiders probably share the same basic code (attack player on sight) they just don't have as much personality.So, I don't love Starfield, but I'm happy to say that I do like it. Those first 90 hours I played were far from perfect, but I've got plenty of reasons to play 90 more.Starfield shares plenty of DNA with Skyrim and Fallout 4, but ultimately falls short of both.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs. He's also a fan of offbeat simulation games, mods, and ignoring storylines in RPGs so he can make up his own.Starfield's inevitable community patch has arrived on the sceneSkyrim's former design lead tips his hat to Baldur's Gate 3: 'Very few of the decisions in a Bethesda game feel highly meaningful, you get maybe three or four'After Payday 3's disastrous launch, Starbreeze partners up with an Australian studio to lend its 'expertise in release management' to a Fortnite IslandBy Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023By Morgan Park4 October 2023By Jon Bailes2 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Metro GameCentral,"GameCentral completes its review of Bethesda’s new sci-fi epic and explores why Starfield fails to live up to its full potential.While it’s not unheard of to be reviewing a game well after it first came out, it is unusual to be doing so after other outlets have already rendered their verdict. Thanks to Bethesda’s refusal to send review copies to multiple UK websites, seemingly in an attempt to manipulate the Metacritic score prior to launch, we’ve been playing catch-up. We’ve avoided reading any reviews, but we have seen the general reaction, which is understandably mixed.That lack of agreement is not because Starfield’s failures and accomplishments are particularly nuanced, it’s more how willing you are to put up with its many foibles. What complicates Starfield’s evaluation is its status as Microsoft’s most import first party release in a generation, with many Xbox and Bethesda fans having convinced themselves of its excellence long before they had a chance to play it for themselves.In trying to look at the game objectively it’s an experience that’s hard to feel passionate about one way or another. Despite its many and obvious failings, it’s not a disaster. Instead, it’s main problem is that, at a conceptual level, it’s not nearly different enough from Skyrim and Fallout to take full advantage of the outer space setting. It’s trying to be two completely different games at once and, predictably, it fails to do either particularly well.We’ve already previewed Starfield, and started a review in progress, so between that and the game’s general ubiquity at the moment, it feels as if it needs no introduction. And yet the central disappointment of the game is the huge gap between what people thought it was going to be, when all the slickly edited gameplay trailers were doing the rounds, and what it actually is.Starfield is, for better and worse, Skyrim in space. Or rather Fallout in space, since both games involve guns and have you spending an awful lot of your time litter-picking, to use your collected bric-a-brac for crafting. You can explore space and get into dogfights, but this never feels like more than an aside, as if it was dropped into the game relatively late in its design.We don’t think it was but the fundamental problem with Starfield is that it doesn’t fully commit to its premise. Rather than space exploration being at the game’s core it’s merely window-dressing for Bethesda’s familiar ground-based action role-playing. Except, instead of a single open world, densely packed with secrets and side quests, everything in Starfield is spread out across a whole virtual galaxy, with many planets having nothing of interest to discover.Beyond Bethesda’s previous work, the two obvious influences on Starfield are No Man’s Sky and Mass Effect. The former comes from a long tradition of British-made space exploration games, stretching back to the early 80s, almost all of which allowed you to seamlessly fly between space and a planet and yet, incredibly, Starfield does not. Here, space is one open world and each planet surface is another, with the only connection between them being cut scenes and loading screens.That’s such an off-puttingly restrictive way of doing things it’s baffling that the game ever got past the design stage with that decision intact. Not only does it mean there’s no planetside flight, but there’s almost nothing to do in your ship beyond space combat. And while getting into a dogfight is fun at first it never evolves beyond its first principles and quickly becomes a sideshow.Rather than feeling like an explorer or dangerous space pirate, questing amongst the stars, all travel is handled on a dull little map screen, your destination chosen automatically by just selecting a mission from a list.That’s not the only thing that runs on autopilot, as your ship computer seems to have read the game script ahead of time, as it always knows exactly where to send you before you or it could ever possibly know. Waypoint markers appear the instant a subject is brought up, and often beforehand, with no need to think or look for anything yourself.That sort of approach works well enough for Rockstar Games but the problem with Starfield’s missions is how unforgivably dull they are. This is partly a mechanical problem, given that the movement system and combat is mediocre and the artificial intelligence weak (laughably so for your allies, who vacillate between hyperactive and utterly disinterested).Although the story missions are incredibly repetitive (we’ll get to the story later) the side quests are impressively varied and unpredictable. For example, there’s one set on a luxury liner in space where you’re trying to get the login details of a bank executive, either because you’re an actual pirate or you’re just pretending to be one as a mole for the military.It’s all set up like a cross between Ocean’s Eleven and an Agatha Christie novel, with high society guests to charm, love affairs to discover, corporate corruption to expose, and a starship captain that secretly wants to be a space pirate. The setting is completely unique and a huge amount of effort has gone into everything. The only problem is it’s completely boring and barely interactive.The writing and characterisation throughout Starfield is flat as a pancake, with dialogue that’s usually competently written but persistently banal. Nothing anyone says or does is in any way interesting and the only small bit of colour is the amusingly bad accents that Bethesda has the voice actors perform.In what should be a sandbox style space heist, where you chose whether to rely on stealth, violence, or charm, you just go where the waypoint markers tell you and pick through the dialogue options, desperately looking for something interesting. You never find it though, as even the options to sweet talk someone just start a silly mini-game where you pick potentially persuasive phrases and hope the RNG decides they work.At the same time, you’re forced to suffer the fact that Bethesda remains well behind the curve in terms of facial animation and still insists on having only one person on screen at once when they’re talking to you. The way they stare straight into the game camera only highlights how unnatural and outdated everything in the game feels and how little has changed since Bethesda’s Xbox 360 days.The other mission example that stood out to us also has an interesting set-up and starts with an apparently routine visit to a research facility, where you suddenly start flipping to an alternative universe version that’s been infested by facehugger-like scorpions. You soon learn how to flip back and forth via the old light/dark world mechanic from Zelda: A Link To The Past, which seems like it’s finally going to offer a bit of variety and fun.Except in Starfield everything is much more linear and there are no real puzzles, so you’re never really working things out, just moving between the only points available. Not only is this vastly less interesting than a 32-year game running on prehistoric hardware but it goes on and on forever, so that your initial excitement at this unexpected novelty slowly seeps away until you can’t wait to see the back of it.This is a consistent problem with Starfield, where so much seems like a good idea in theory but in practice proves underdeveloped and unexciting. Starfield is so undercooked it’s probably a danger to pregnant women.We need to emphasise, though, that nothing about it is terrible. Although the steals from Mass Effect and No Man’s Sky are very obvious there’s something about it which is also reminiscent of Assassin’s Creed, in that the game has a huge amount of things to do but never anything of substance. The normal difficulty mode offers very little challenge and yet almost every action is rewarded by a shower of loot – in an attempt to hide the fact that you’re just going through the same actions again and again in a slightly different context.The game’s less generous with the experience points but the skill tree is one of its best features. At the top level it doesn’t function much differently than Fallout but while you can unlock the first level of each ability with a skill point, the others aren’t available until you’ve completed an achievement-liked task related to the skill, like winning X number of persuasion attempts or using a jetpack in combat. It’s a shame you can’t re-spec though, considering how long it takes to level up.As sci-fi and astronomy fans we managed to enjoy the way the alien worlds are portrayed, even if a lot of the alien creatures are just minor variations of each other. There are some nice landscapes, as well as some cool sci-fi interiors, but otherwise the tech for the game is very unimpressive, especially the constant loading pauses. Every sizeable building requires a two second loading wait to enter and there are often more inside as well, with even caves needing them.This combined with the abuse of fast travel, where the game encourages you to use it at every opportunity, means you end up staring at a blank screen, and the little circular loading indicator, for seemingly half the game. Bethesda were a rich company even before they got bought by Microsoft, they should be able to do better than this, but all sense of immersion or continuity is shattered by how low-tech the game is, as it just becomes a disjointed sequence of unconnected events, with no sense of place.Nevertheless, we’re sure lots of people will get into the ship construction and the outpost building – which works very similarly to Fallout 4. The problem with these, though, is that not only are they completely unnecessary to complete the game on normal, but the game rarely ever brings them up. If we didn’t know the options were there already it’s possible we could’ve missed them entirely. And even then the game is terrible at explaining how they work.Many of these issues are common to previous Bethesda titles, but they become increasingly hard to bear the more time goes on and Bethesda does too little to address them. This includes their long-running bug problem and while there are no serious performance issues the game still has far too many glitches for something this expensive. Most are minor graphical or AI faults, but we also had several crash bugs and freezes that had to be reloaded.Everything in Starfield seems like a good idea in principal and yet nothing works nearly as well as you’d hope. This includes the plot which, again, is so underdeveloped we were genuinely shocked when it ended, in the most anticlimactic way possible, as we would’ve sworn we were only halfway through. You can spend hundreds of hours exploring every corner of Starfield, but the story missions can probably be rushed through in a dozen hours or less.It’s just a fundamentally uninteresting fictional universe, with no new ideas of its own and too many obvious steals from famous sci-fi games and movies. It doesn’t help that the story missions are the most repetitive and uninspired aspect of the whole game. With only a few exceptions they simply have you going to a new planet and acquiring a mysterious, seemingly alien, artefact from a cave.With each new artefact you get a new superpower (the game’s equivalent to Skyrim Shouts) but that also involves doing the same repetitive task every time, just on a different planet. That wouldn’t matter so much if the story had any kind of depth but there’s almost nothing to it and while Bethesda is clearly trying to evoke the philosophical musings of 2001 the only real similarity is that they hired one of the same actors.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepDespite all the many problems, we wouldn’t discourage anyone from giving Starfield a go on Game Pass, where you don’t have to pay any additional fee for it. There’s absolutely no depth to the game, and zero invention, but even with the bugs there’s nothing ruinous in terms of either the game design or mechanics (although the lack of a ground map does beggar belief).Starfield isn’t a broken game, it’s just a dull one. Exploring the unknown depths of space is one of the most exciting concepts possible for a video game and yet Starfield has managed to make it all seem so unexciting and repetitive. Rather than reaching for the stars this lets a golden opportunity, to make the definitive space adventure, slip through its fingers.In Short: A disappointingly low-tech space exploration game that relies too much on the legacy of Skyrim and Fallout and lacks the innovation and imagination to do its concept justice.Pros: The scale of the game is impressive and some of the planets and sci-fi hardware can look very good. Excellent skill tree. Starship and outpost customisation has tons of options.Cons: Unengaging missions, held back by mediocre combat and bland storytelling. Flawed exploration with content spread too thin and no physical connection between space and planet surfaces. Constant loading and abuse of fast travel ruins the sense of immersion. Plenty of bugs.Score: 6/10Formats: Xbox Series X/S (reviewed) and PCPrice: £69.99*Publisher: BethesdaDeveloper: Bethesda Game StudiosRelease Date: 6th September 2023Age Rating: 18*Permanently available on Game PassEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.

You'll pick a mission with all the best intentions of seeing it through and yet emerge, blinking, hours later on a completely different planet from where you intended to be, with endless tales of space battles, enemy encounters, and adventures under your belt muttering, ""wait, what was I doing again?"" It took me two days just to start the first main story mission once I was clear of the opening. I just got lost exploring planets, meeting people, and bouncing between events that I stumbled upon. Release date: September 1, 2023
Platform(s): PC, Xbox Series X
Developer: Bethesda Game Studios
Publisher: Bethesda SoftworksMy biggest vice is ship building. I'll be on a mission, land in a spaceport, and just take a quick look at what engines are for sale… and then six hours have passed and I've added an entire extra floor to my ship. Or there's surveying – scan all the animals, plants, and resources on any given planet or moon and you can sell the data. It's all too easy to finish an objective, realize you've done a 70% scan without trying, and, well, you might as well finish it and… shit, I've done it again. Okay, I'm definitely doing a main mission now. Ooh, wait, what's that over there.  If you've never played a Bethesda game before then that's kind of its whole thing – massive open worlds full of things to find and do. There are plenty of big faction missions, and a main campaign, but you'll collect an assortment of quests almost anywhere you go and entire evenings can pass by doing bits and pieces. Sometimes you'll find a fetch quest, sometimes a fancy sci-fi loot cave, and other times a chunky, multipart mission that lasts hours, just tucked away in a back alley somewhere. Sure, you can drill through the main story if you want to but you're kind of missing the point – the experience is more about existing and seeing where it takes you, rather than completing anything. With this kind of freedom 'avoiding the main mission' is the main mission.  The cities you explore, and groups you join, all feel like separate games in their own right with their own rules, culture, and character. New Atlantis is probably the 'main' location; a gleaming Star Trek utopia where the group Constellation will have you scouring the galaxy for mysterious artifacts. You'll also find the United Colonies Vanguard here who task you with fighting alien infestations and going undercover as a Space Pirate. Akila City is basically Firefly space cowboy land, where you'll bring frontier law to laser-wielding bandits. Then there's Neon, a drug-addled, Blade Runner-style cyberpunk dystopia featuring Ryujin, which has you sneaking around doing corporate espionage. And, finally, Cydonia is a rusty industrial Mars settlement that channels The Expanse's whole 'space is rubbish for normal people' thing.With this kind of freedom 'avoiding the main mission' is the main mission.Missions are varied and creative, from straight up fights to things like heists with multiple paths, investigative encounters where you're just talking to people to get info, and all sorts of other possibilities. You're never entirely sure of what's coming next and I've been surprised more than once, or reloaded saves to see all the available options. Whatever style of play appeals to you there's almost certainly something in Starfield to support it. Killing everyone is always kind of the default option but you can be stealthy, or get creative with dialogue and tech to find your own solutions. I've gone big on Persuasion, and the amount of things I've talked my way through almost feels like cheating at this point.Outside of big scripted narrative beats there are hundreds of planets to explore, full of smaller procedurally-generated locations. And there's also outpost building, gear crafting and modding, and so on. I'm currently 80+ hours in and yet to get bored or even slightly fatigued because there's always something to switch my attention towards when I fancy a change. For me, the loop is usually a few big story missions and then, when I want to decompress, some planet surveying or ship building. Usually, along the way, I'll clear out some random missions, loot a few bases for gear, collect resources for upgrades, run into some cannon fodder enemies, and so on – just sort of going with the flow until I'm ready for another big plot beat and the cycle continues.  As with every Bethesda game, Encumbrance returns. Carry too much and your stamina, or oxygen here, drains as you move, limiting mobility. The ability to only track entire recipes, rather than ingredients, adds to the issue making it hard to filter out what you need.The ship building takes a bit of time to really get into but, once you do, it's an addictive time sink as you tweak designs, add cabins, balance engines, weight, cargo, and ship systems. I like really big spacecraft, not for any power but because I like to walk around all the rooms, and look out the windows. The only thing I haven't really engaged with much is the outpost building. It works well enough and you can knock up pleasing bases relatively easily, it's just not something that's bothered me much and the game doesn't really seem to have a huge use for it bar bulk resource gathering. Starfield feels very solid mechanically. Gunplay is great, with weapons offering a nice impact compared to the rattly floatiness of Fallout. While ship battles are exciting, especially when you nail that high speed arcing turn to bring all your guns to bear on a tricky enemy. That said, space flight generally is largely smoke and mirrors. You do fly around in combat, and to approach or dock with space stations, but you mainly get around via fast travel to reach systems or land on planets. Given the physical scale of everything it makes sense – it takes ages to fly even small distances manually. Similarly, while you can walk anywhere on a planet's surface, it's a planet – you can run for hours and still only be a few miles from where you started. Fast travel is the only way to get around in any reasonable time.  For everything Bethesda gets right, there are a few strange decisions: some basic skills like stealth or pickpocketing are locked behind opening up the core ability. It means you can't do these activities at all, even badly, until you invest a point in the skill tree. I accessed 'Stealth' specifically because, without it, you might as well strap bells to your space suit and quieter missions would be hell. I understand leveling up to progress things but denying access completely does feel odd.  With crafting as well you can only track entire recipes, rather than individual ingredients. That can make everyone's least favorite idea, Encumbrance, a constant problem as you collect all marked ingredients because you can't tell which ones you actually need. I ended up keeping notes on my phone because of that. Overall though, everything works well and feels stable too. There's the odd framerate stutter when you first load into a highly populated area, I've had a couple of dancing dead bodies and the odd NPC standing awkwardly in shot during dialogue, but have experienced nothing catastrophic (yet). I'm playing on a decent-ish PC running a 2070 Super and it's had no trouble. Starfield is a good looking game too, even the cave you start in is oddly impressive, while all the cities are all beautifully detailed places to explore. And, for every lifeless gray moon you'll find, there's a lurid jungle to chase weird animals across. At one point I was scanning alien fish on a coast at night when a lightning storm came in over the sea and it's got to be one of my top gaming moments of this year.For me, Starfield is the best thing Bethesda has done since The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, and has that same density and life to it – where walking in just about any direction will find you something to do. The sense of discovery, and progression as you explore feels incredibly organic and this seems like the culmination of everything Bethesda has learned in the last 25 years. The DNA is clear throughout, with Fallout 4 and Fallout 76's crafting and building systems immediately recognisable for one thing. While waking someone up in bed to hand in a mission will be instantly familiar to anyone who's ever tried to complete an objective after lights out since Morrowind. I know Bethesda's style of game doesn't gel with everyone, but I love the exploration and sense of discovery in what it does, and Starfield represents some of the best world building the studio has done in a long time. For every moment I've spent careening around planets shooting anything that moves, there are always other opportunities presented elsewhere: casing a museum to steal its contents, or mingling at a billionaire's cocktail party trying to uncover embezzlement. And, occasionally, I'll shout ""potato!"" while wandering the endless expanse of space because there's a pointless tiny side mission that requires 50 of them and for some reason they're hard to find. I have literally broken back into space jail, seconds after being arrested, to steal back my precious confiscated potatoes because I am finishing that job, even if it kills me. Starfield isn't really a game you play to complete, it's more about living whatever sort of life you want in the literal universe Bethesda has created. Whatever you're thinking of doing, you almost certainly can do it, and the scale is almost a release in a way – you'll probably never see or do it all, so just enjoy the moment. There's months, if not years, of discoveries buried away in here, and even after 80 hours I can't wait to see more. Starfield was reviewed on PC, with code provided by the publisher.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Game Informer,"Even in the increasingly crowded marketplace of big, expansive games, Starfield stands out. Leveraging the gameplay Bethesda popularized with The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, Starfield expands the breadth of exploration to a galaxy of solar systems, planets, and ships. It populates those environments with a rich palette of activities and missions that tap into the outer space fantasy. It’s a staggering span of content to wrap one’s head around. At times, that scope threatens to impair the focus and pacing, and moment-to-moment gameplay is not always a strong suit. But players can expect to uncover hundreds of hours of experimentation in a richly imagined sci-fi playground, and that thrill is worth experiencing.Your crafted character begins life as a space miner who inexplicably connects with an inscrutable buried artifact, granting visions of a grand cosmic mystery. That foundational event puts you in contact with a tightly-knit group of explorers working to decipher the secret. The introduction opens the door to your adventures across a vast network of human colony worlds that has sprung up after an exodus from Earth.Character dialogue and storytelling is top-notch, with novel personalities and interactions every step of the way. The mostly independent storylines of different factions, corporations, and companions each tap into different sci-fi tropes, from being hunted by a monstrous xenoweapon alien to infiltrating a pirate fleet to being a frontier lawman on the fringes of known space. The variety of these experiences keeps things fresh, especially when you layer in additional emergent opportunities, like setting up mining outposts, surveying planets, buying and decorating a home, or pursuing a romance with one of your companions. Starfield is a game of endless distractions, where new mission threads and activities are constantly beckoning. I found the most enjoyment when I allowed those threads to pull me to and fro, creating a web of interactions I could flip between as I saw fit. Some activities, like visiting alien temples, hunting down merc ships, or clearing out bases of outlaws, can start to feel repetitive if taken on without a break to do other things. I also grew frustrated at the frequent ping-ponging between mission givers and destinations; even with fast travel, it felt especially egregious to be flying to an entirely different star system only to fly back to tell someone what I saw there. Nonetheless, several mission moments are standout and memorable, like a research lab shifting between different states of reality or a corporate espionage exchange in the back room of a dance club. In its best moments, I was immersed in Starfield’s unfolding tale.The joy of exploration is a core tenet of play, and nailing that sensation is central to Starfield’s success. I loved landing on a new planet and seeing unknown megafauna wandering the plains or entering a new city and finding the seediest dive bar. Arrive in a new system and dock with a derelict space station – who knows what’s inside? Starfield is a story about both the good and the bad of humanity’s desire to reach further and uncover what’s just out of grasp, and I love that those themes weave into the flow of how players may approach the game. That engagement is only enhanced by the high quality of the presentation; this is an immaculate visual landscape filled with details juxtaposed against the grandeur of space, accentuated by a wistful, questing musical score that always nails the right mood.I found navigating Starfield obtuse, both in moving around a giant map of stars and its U.I. and systems. Figuring out how to do basic tasks, like selling excess inventory, modifying my ship, adjusting crew assignments, or reaching a particular star system, often made me scratch my head. The constant need to enter menus to reach destinations hampers the sensation of seamless travel. I started to feel like it was a car dashboard where no button was where I expected it to be. But once I learned my way around, it was a vehicle that took me to some remarkable destinations.Ground combat is central to the experience, and most players are likely to spend a significant chunk of time with a gun in their hand, even if they try as I did, to lean into persuasion and stealth for many encounters. I enjoyed the diversity of weapons, from laser rifles to shotguns that seemed yanked out of an old Western. Traversal is thrilling thanks to the jet boost packs you can wear on your back to leap and mantle through environments quickly. But gunplay feels stiff and mechanical, and enemies pursue unwise pathing and positioning that rarely leads to real challenge or tension. Pulling out the big guns and laying waste to a base of baddies is entertaining, but the action itself left me cold.Shipborne space combat also plays a big role, and I love having a chance to tap into that craving. But I rarely encountered battles that clicked. I completely wiped out the enemy forces in moments, or the ships arrayed against me were way out of my league – there was little in between.It took me a long time to fall in love with Starfield, and even after I did, certain aspects didn’t work for me. But the things I didn’t enjoy are vastly outweighed by my enthusiasm for this new, original science fiction universe, the breadth of its adventures, and the appeal of its many interwoven stories. Go in with the expectation that it will take some time to find your footing in such a vast gameplay space, and there’s a universe well worth discovering here.

GameSpot,"Bethesda's spacefaring adventure has its moments with impressive scale, satisfying combat, and some worthwhile side quests, but its shallow RPG systems and uninspired vision of the cosmos make for a journey that's a mile wide, but an inch deep.By 
    Michael Higham
   on August 31, 2023 at 9:00AM PDTIt's hard to ponder the infinite possibilities of space and not get romantic about it. Our imagination of the cosmos has taken many artistic forms, and the hard science behind the greatest discoveries on the final frontier has been just as enthralling. It's this sense of wonder that makes the prospect of Starfield so intriguing--even more so than if it were just Bethesda Game Studios' next major RPG. However, it's best to cast aside that love and fascination with space because, at its core, Starfield follows a very familiar formula without meaningfully engaging with its setting or the gameplay systems therein.Starfield is undoubtedly impressive in scale, from the sheer number of star systems and planets you can explore to the multitude of gameplay mechanics that tie the experience together. But once you start to see how all these big ideas are interconnected from a narrative perspective and technical standpoint, the illusion of a grand cosmic voyage shatters and the veneer starts to wear thin. And so, somewhere along my 55 or so hours spent playing Starfield, I dropped the notion of finding that wondrous space adventure and accepted Starfield for what it is: a shooter-focused RPG in the traditional Bethesda framework that has its wild and fun moments but one that's ultimately a mile wide and an inch deep.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Starfield Video ReviewStarfield's main quest is the most emblematic of the game's shortcomings. Despite romanticizing the idea of taking to the stars to explore the great unknown, these narrative ambitions fall into shallow stories that undersell the spacefaring premise. You start as a lowly miner extracting resources for a faceless corporation and within minutes, come in contact with an ""Artifact"" that activates mysterious visions of something bigger out in the galaxy--a sort of leaving-the-vault moment like in Fallout. You're then shuffled into the ranks of a small organization called Constellation, whose sole purpose is to chase these Artifacts and uncover their purpose. With the handful of characters who make up the group, Starfield tries to instill personality into its story, but consistently weak writing and generic dialogue means these characters--who do have a few interesting moments along the way--largely fall flat.It's especially tough to buy into the Artifact-collecting scenario when the game's story extolls the virtues of science, yet undermines them by haphazardly throwing around scientific concepts in dialogue and then resorting to inexplicable supernatural forces that everyone in-game seems to just accept at face value. There's very little weight or impact given to what characters often describe as great discoveries that could change the course of history, and it's missing an earnest examination on the nature of humanity's place in space, even when it tries to be self-reflective. I was never asking Starfield to lecture me on quantum physics, but I hoped for a story that wants to pay reverence to the scientific philosophies that make the genre intriguing to give those concepts their necessary respect.The wild goose chase that is the main quest lacks strong motivations from a narrative perspective, and the mission structure mostly relies on a predictable formula. You're often shooting your way through mining facilities to dig up Artifacts your colleagues happened to locate halfway across the galaxy, which involves taking down space pirates because you need someone to shoot. Or you're fast-traveling to faraway star systems to fetch clues on the next objective, follow laughably nonsensical riddles, or have conversations that could've been an email. There are occasional breaks in this process that lead to notable moments, such as having to navigate the grimey underbelly of the cyberpunk-inspired city of Neon, where all the dystopian archetypes thrive.Engaging in tense conversations offer some variance in the moment-to-moment beats but the outcomes are largely the same, like when I had to resolve a bank robbery on a remote planet that resembled the American Old West, or cut a deal with a space pirate for an important item I needed--you'd be surprised how far a simple Persuasion check can get you, yet how little the game cared if it went one way or another. If the situation devolved into a shootout, the people around town would barely bat an eye or give a tangible response to the fact that I resorted to violence.These kinds of moments highlight the illusion of choice, where supposed moral quandaries boil down to vague differences in philosophy, and this extends across the story and through the final encounters with Starfield's main antagonists. Towards the end, the main quest legitimately started to shine by setting aside its RPG-light storytelling and embracing being a full-on shooter. One sequence borrows inspiration from Titanfall 2's Effect and Cause mission, and a late-game mission tested the limits of my combat prowess with satisfying challenge. And despite the underwhelming revelations leading up to the conclusion, Starfield does have a moment of brilliance in how it lets you end your journey, contextualizing New Game+ in one of the most interesting ways I've seen while offering a few noteworthy incentives for a second run.As is tradition with Bethesda games, however, the golden path questline is not exactly the main course, and it's in the side quests where Starfield is at its best. Here, you set aside the wonders of the great unknown and instead dive into the problems of various factions and the people who've settled in the few cities and towns scattered across the galaxy.One such example is the Crimson Fleet faction questline, where the de facto galactic government coerces you into going undercover inside space's biggest criminal ring--and this chain of quests is one of the finest in a Bethesda RPG. It's not so much the ethical dilemmas or tension you feel when bouncing between the two factions, but the fact you find yourself in the middle of some wild situations like corporate disputes, intense shootouts, blackmailing characters, and infiltrating high-security facilities. Compelling subplots emerge in the process that also tie back to the quest at hand, and you're hit with some exceptional setpieces that incorporate multiple facets of Starfield's gameplay systems at a steady pace. I even found myself conflicted when making final decisions since certain side characters began to grow on me. Once the dust settled, I moved on with trekking the galaxy, constantly searching for the same high.Not every optional questline matches that scope and depth, but there are certainly rare flashes of similar quality. Getting caught up in megacorp Ryujin Industries' messy business by starting as a rank-and-file employee then meddling in its affairs from the inside was worth seeing through for the corporate drama. Playing space deputy for the Freestar Collective, on the other hand, wasn't as intriguing per se. It turned out to be predictable on the whole, but it took me to new locations, featured some fun firefights, and offered valuable rewards. Although a bit superficial, helping a ship full of people who never made human contact after leaving Earth hundreds of years ago brought me to a resort-style planet to deal with a greedy CEO, and ultimately gave me the chance to find those in need a new home.Side content comes in varying degrees of quality, but these are the kinds of rabbit holes you want to fall down; they are what make Starfield worth unraveling, even if the process often feels like a checklist of objectives to blaze through. And at times, they culminate in something almost meaningful. At the same time, the setting starts to seem superficial as it's less about life on the cosmic frontier and more about petty human problems that are just by-the-book extensions of what we deal with on Earth. While they don't give the impression of having major impacts on the galaxy's fate, or explore topics of technology and corporate exploitation impacting human life with much depth, side content is dealt out in droves, and the potential of finding something special propelled me to keep perusing the galaxy in hopes of discovering a worthwhile thread.Through these various questlines--main story and side content alike--the limitations of Starfield's RPG elements came to light. Dialogue options evoke slightly different responses or tease more information, but rarely influence the overarching path. Once you see the machinations, you can gauge what you can get away with and realize quests stay on a set track. You may get the opportunity to use the arbitrary Persuasion check, which breaks off as a minigame awkwardly detached from the actual conversation at hand, or bribe your way past objectives, but those exist as shortcuts to the same end result.However, there's still a sense of building your character and progression since you can pick permanent traits at the start and earn skill points as you level up. The skill tree streamlines the perks, stats, and traits of previous Bethesda RPGs which makes sense because Starfield isn't really concerned with giving you multiple avenues to solve problems or complete objectives. There aren't really ""builds,"" rather game mechanics you'll want to prioritize like damage for specific weapon-types, lockpicking, persuasion success rate, or whatever you deem important engaging with.Starfield picks up some of that slack when it becomes a shooter thanks to satisfying gunplay and a roster of varied weapons to tinker with. While you shouldn't expect the feel of, say, Destiny 2, the shooting in Starfield is by far the best Bethesda has offered. Especially when I was zipping around with my jetpack in a big firefight, melting robots with a tricked-out laser rifle before switching to a punchy auto-shotgun to thin out space pirates or blast away intimidating creatures, it was hard to deny Starfield's chops as a shooter. When combat clicks and sustains the intensity in high-level shootouts, it mitigates the sting of the shallow RPG systems in place.The spacefaring fantasy wouldn't be complete without your own ship to pilot in dogfights. Ship combat can be frustrating at times, and having to manually allocate a pool of resources to specific functions of your ship on the fly--like engine speed, weapon power, and shield potency--takes some getting used to. But, as I got more involved in earning new ships, upgrading my piloting skills, and buying better parts, I became more satisfied with engaging in ship combat, especially against imposing enemy fleets who I also had to outmaneuver to take down. They're straightforward encounters, but some quests will force you into these scenarios with some dramatic narrative context, which helps it feel like less of an afterthought.While I do appreciate having a spaceship as a means to break up the pace and add variety with combat, piloting one also highlights the segmented nature of how you actually navigate Starfield's worlds. Presumably for convenience's sake, trekking across the galaxy is relegated to strings of fast travel points. You pull up your starmap, chart the course, jump to a planet's low orbit, then select largely predetermined landing points on the surface. There's a lack of seamlessness since each step in the process is broken into multiple steps where you're mostly pulling up menus, watching short scene transitions, and sitting through loading screens. It's worth noting that you don't actually fly to planets in real-time, and flying in space is sort of an instanced bubble with nearby planets in the background. All this creates the feeling that Starfield's universe is rather small and, very quickly, I'd treat planets as a collection of fast-travel points, disjointed stand-ins for individual towns or cities.Impressively massive metropolises like New Atlantis or dense and interesting cities like Neon are peppered throughout the journey, but unlike in the Elder Scrolls or Fallout games, there isn't a build-up to discovering them. This is due in part to the absence of a larger overworld that can be used to pique interest and stoke curiosity, leading players to have that moment of unveiling new locations. Instead, it's the menus that funnel players directly into these locations, eliminating the sense of awe and wonder that comes from stumbling upon them. And even finding your way around these places is a pain with the near-complete absence of a local map system--I became familiar enough with the pathways to find key locations in frequently visited places, but it's a major oversight that in a space-traveling future, we can't get a halfway decent map of the most populated settlements.Though very limited from a gameplay perspective, space exploration is still novel in Starfield, harkening back to the hours I spent in Mass Effect's galaxy maps out of sheer curiosity. Pulling up the starmap to see a hundred-something planets is stunning, and I still love being overwhelmed by the view of a new planet from my ship in low orbit and reading its data as if it's a real place. However, the sense of discovery is dulled when I'm often landing on barren planets, slogging my way across them on foot only to find the same mining facility or research laboratory I found halfway across the galaxy on another planet.One consolation is being able to build your own outposts on habitable planets, which is an endeavor for those who want to get into setting up mining operations for resource collecting and using the research mechanics to unlock new items. Starfield borrows from Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 in this regard, and the systems and inventory management are as cumbersome as ever. But from the few hours I spent delving into building my own outpost on a remote planet in the far reaches of space, I saw the value of establishing an ecosystem even if it's only for the sake of creating intricate settlements for myself and crewmates I've recruited to help with the operation.There are a ton of interconnected systems that make up Starfield's overall gameplay experience, so in a way, it's surprising to see how it comes together with relative polish. Bethesda RPGs have a reputation for being buggy--and don't get me wrong, Starfield has its fair share of bugs--but I've mostly encountered rather inoffensive glitches like floating eyeballs or characters clipping through walls or getting stuck in place, which were fixed by reloading or rebooting the game. Across my 55-plus hours, I jumped between a high-end PC, a minimum-spec laptop, and both Xbox Series X and S. Starfield is a demanding game and you'll get some frame drops in densely populated areas or in the heat of battle where particle effects fill up the screen, yet the game always managed to stay playable on reasonable graphics settings. The 30fps cap on consoles is a bit disappointing, but the most important part is that it held a consistent frame rate throughout.Accounting for all its ups and downs, the main thing I wrestle with is that Starfield is missing an overall sense of purpose. My favorite RPGs have their fair share of shortcomings and limitations, but the best ones always leave a lasting impact that comes through having a clear purpose. Even my favorite Bethesda RPGs do this well. Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim have intricate magic systems, cultures to familiarize yourself with, and rewards for exploration in whichever direction you wander in. Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas drops you in a barren desert wasteland as a nobody, yet is so full of personality, humor, and sobering examinations of the human condition in the wake of a societal collapse. I can't help but feel Starfield banked on the intrigue of space exploration and the vastness of the cosmos, and forgot to create an identity beyond that.Despite the nigh-limitless possibilities the final frontier offers, Starfield's version of humanity remains largely homogeneous--300 or so years into the future across the galaxy, and the game's imagination rarely extends beyond the sci-fi archetypes we've seen many a time. It doesn't have much to say about humanity leaving Earth behind and doesn't really reckon with the realities that dictate the world--our world--that inspires its very premise. In the periphery, you can learn about how life is sustainable across the galaxy or tease out lore on how governments and religions evolved, but Starfield struggles to integrate that into its core ethos. I didn't come in expecting something poetic like the Carl Sagan books I read growing up, awe-inspiring like The Outer Wilds, or as intricate as the sci-fi lore built over the course of the Mass Effect trilogy. But I did want something more than the pared-down Bethesda template transposed over a space setting.Starfield has its moments, for sure. Its satisfying gunplay makes combat exciting, especially when it's integrated into setpieces within its better, more captivating questlines. And although limited in its conception of space exploration, there's a novelty in poking around the galaxy to see star systems up close and personal, and occasionally finding side content worth chasing. However, it struggles to deliver a cohesive and memorable RPG experience amid the seemingly boundless sea of stars. For all its reverence for scientific philosophy, its stories and characters paint a rather tame and sterile vision for what our spacefaring future could look like. When you strip Starfield down to its essentials, it relies on a tried-and-true, but well-tread formula while missing some of the depth of the games that came before it. Starfield is a game more concerned with quantity than quality, and leaves the experience at the surface level.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Xbox’s big exclusive takes on the vastness of spaceWith Starfield, Bethesda’s ambition has exceeded its craft.It’s difficult to speak definitively when discussing a game like this, a role-playing epic about exploring an infinite expanse. One player might choose to join a gang of pirates, make as much money as possible, then set off on a shiny new ship to test the boundaries of space. Another might fill out a job application to join the corporate faction Ryujin Industries, which exerts influence over all settled colonies, and rise through the ranks. Meanwhile, I enjoy Starfield most when I’m able to piddle around for hours delivering coffee orders, taxiing people around the solar system, and assisting in scientific research.All this is to say that Starfield is vast. Though I’ve played nearly 50 hours of the game during the pre-release review period, I’ve reached a tiny fraction of its supposed 1,000 planets. I’ve collected every artifact, infiltrated a pirate crew as an undercover narc (against my will), fancied up my spaceship, run errands for random people, and searched for resources on barren planets. There is so much to do and so many people to meet across the cosmos, on new worlds to which humans have escaped after fleeing a blighted Earth. For all of this vastness, though, Starfield often feels sterile, and it buries its best moments beneath so much tedium.Starfield has been in development for eight years, according to game director Todd Howard, and it shows. You’ll find atmospheric places and compelling stories amid the bespoke planets and procedurally generated environments, but too many of Bethesda’s vistas feel like a homogenized version of space. Sure, there are moments in Starfield that celebrate the strangeness, glory, and power of life across the cosmos — but there’s just as much lifelessness.Starfield’s main quest line puts me in cahoots with Constellation, an intrepid and infamous group of space explorers bent on tracking down mysterious artifacts that have an unknown power. It’s a hunt that takes me — an explorer and empath who’s burdened by an overeager reply guy, in keeping with a trait I selected before embarking on my journey — to a bunch of different planets across a couple of solar systems, leaving dead pirates and other space bad guys in my wake. You can recruit new followers both as your ship’s crewmates and as exploration companions. You’ll often find potential crew members, with varying skills, lingering around populated settlements, equally intent on finding an excuse to soar into space and leave their lives behind.Starfield has several major hubs: dusty, Wild West-esque Akila City, on the planet of Akila; Neon, a cyberpunk city on Volii Alpha; The Key, a space station overtaken by pirates; and New Atlantis, the futuristic United Colonies metropolis on Jemison. Like Winterhold, the Vegas Strip, and Vivec City before them, these locations serve as sources for faction missions, side stories, and miscellaneous quests. Crucially, though, they’re singular points of interest on planets that are much larger and much emptier beyond the city walls. There are exciting and surprising things to discover on the outskirts (and even farther out). But more often than not, these swaths of land simply hold an abandoned research station, or a cave that’s overrun by pirates or religious zealots. These places aren’t inherently uninteresting in their own right, but when you’ve come across a half dozen of them already, and gunned down said inhabitants time and time again, the scenarios start to blend together.New Atlantis, the first urban area you discover, is a tightly controlled Epcot-esque utopia that hides its inequality underground; the poor people literally live in squalor beneath the city. The first person I spoke to after disembarking from the city’s tram system was a sanitation worker. She looked tired, I rudely told this stranger, and she said she wished she had a break to grab a coffee. There was an option for me to get one for her, so I did: I ran to a nearby kiosk and returned with the concoction she had been pining for. There was no meaningful reward aside from the little spark of joy in doing something kind for someone — even a minor character planted outside of the tram for a bit of flavor when you step into the bustle of the city. It’s a tiny, fleeting moment in a game all about vastness and infinity, but it was personal. It was human. And it was a far cry from New Atlantis’ otherwise anodyne, corporate vibes, which I suspect may be intentional — an extension of the promised perfect life in space, away from the destruction found on Earth.Shortly afterward, I delved into the commotion of the city streets, where strangers loudly discussed local news or barked out tips to me, right before corresponding activities appeared in one of Starfield’s many, many menus. I interacted with quest givers in the most artificial way possible — that is, with all of humanity removed from the equation. In fact, had my handy watch not notified me about the new quests, I never would have known I had interacted with anyone at all. It doesn’t help that Starfield kills most of the momentum it ever generates, the artificiality separating me from its most satisfying moments. I reached a standstill dozens of times throughout my campaign, where streaks of inspired stories or entrancing exploration came to a screeching halt because of Starfield’s overwhelming menus. There are quick-save slots for weapons, but if you run out of ammo or need a weapon that’s not saved, there will be lots of flicking back and forth through layers of screens. It’s also a real slog to jump from planet to planet via Starfield’s menus, halted by jump limits, fuel levels, and all sorts of other numbers just trying to find a barren rock floating in space, before doing it all over again. Space travel in Starfield is ultimately a series of loading screens.And so, the problem remains: Starfield can feel insipid in a way that certainly must not be intentional. I would estimate that I struggled to stay interested in Starfield for the first 15 hours of my campaign, completing fetch quests for Constellation and hopping from derivative handcrafted planets to procedurally generated spaces of “not much.” In those 15 hours, I didn’t find many more of the small delights that delivering coffee brought me, nor did I find many incidental threads to pull; instead, I largely grav-jumped across planets pockmarked by abandoned mines, in which I had to plow through hordes of gunslingers to grow my pile of loot. In these crucial early hours of the game, where it’s essential to hook a player, Starfield opts for the standard gameplay loop I can find in so many other places: Kill everything on sight, then collect whatever you came for. For all of the game’s invocations of wonder and discovery, I rarely felt as if I was discovering anything wonderful.But on unexpected occasions, wonder struck: At one point, I was aimlessly grav-jumping to meet the qualifications for the next skill upgrade. I soon found a massive ship hovering within a planet’s orbit, but there was no way to communicate with it from the surface; turns out, it was a vessel that left Earth 200 years ago. The people on the ship, generations that had lived and died within the confines of its hull, believed themselves to be alone in the world, the only survivors of Earth’s demise. Forget about a minor activity; that’s a storyline that’s interesting enough to hang an entire game on. I want to see more of these sorts of experiences in Starfield, and maybe I’ll find them eventually — but maybe I won’t.Blockbuster video games have only gotten bigger and more expensive to make in the eight years since Bethesda Game Studios began work on Starfield. In that time, we’ve seen a handful of studios try to make “the ultimate game,” one that can be whatever the player wants it to be. Starfield falls into a cloudy space between the awe-inspiring infinity of No Man’s Sky and the handcrafted brilliance of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. In an effort to impart that ever-elusive sense of vastness in Starfield, Bethesda’s Pete Hines claimed that the game doesn’t even begin until you’ve finished the main quest. I disagree: This is a game that started well before I finished the main story, in a fleeting interaction with a coffee-craving stranger; or during a heist on a space cruise; or on an accidental foray into the lonely hallways of a ship whose generations of passengers thought that all was lost, only to find that humanity had survived. But Starfield buries these adventures so deep beneath layers of artificiality and behind stalled momentum that they’ve become lost in all of this “ultimate game.”Starfield exists in the push and pull between a carefully crafted world and the vastness of procedurally generated planets. Bethesda embraced the idea of more, and in turn, watered down the parts of space exploration and discovery that are most compelling to me: how humans relate to it. The expanse of Starfield’s world leaves gaps unfilled, and Bethesda has opted instead to simply spread further, rather than flesh out what’s already there.With Starfield, Bethesda has put all of its efforts into exploring the dark, vast corners of outer space. In the process, it has drained a lot of the humanity I was hoping to find in its wake. In trying to do everything, Starfield obfuscates its most compelling mysteries. Starfield will be released Sept. 6 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X, with early access beginning Sept. 1.

Kotaku,"As my spaceship emerges from interstellar travel to orbit a once-distant alien world, I know that once I’m down on its surface, it won’t feel like a world at all. Instead, what Starfield will give me is a series of zones, awkwardly stitched together in a way that makes it hard to pretend they make up a planet. This world, pretty though it may be, is merely a stage set. That’s true of any game’s world, of course, but in Starfield, the illusion doesn’t hold up under the weight of so much menu diving, so many loading screens, so much repetition in planetary features and structures. Yet I land here anyway, ready to see what awaits, because there’s something at the core of Starfield that’s clicked with me, something that makes me wrestle with human truths and grand cosmic mysteries I can’t resist. I just wish the game’s weak points didn’t undermine the illusion it’s striving to create.Released on September 6, 2023, Starfield is acclaimed developer Bethesda’s first original property since The Elder Scrolls, the fantasy role-playing series it kicked off with Arena way back in 1994. And although Bethesda is known for crafting vast worlds to explore, Starfield promises a scale like no other: Instead of one big map for the player to chart their own adventure across, there are over 1,000 planets to explore. First announced in 2018, it sounded incredible, and fueled the sci-fi dreams of millions of players for years during the long wait for its release. However, in actuality that increased scale doesn’t deliver the same thrills of exploration and discovery found in the best Bethesda games. True, Starfield never fails to feel vast, but the decision to provide such a scale of worlds, which you often navigate through fast-travel menu options instead of by roaming freely in your ship or on foot, easily tips over into quantity over quality. The central quest you can pursue in the midst of all this vastness is oddly compelling, but Starfield’s dialogue and worldbuilding are vanilla at best, and deeply unimaginative and derivative at worst. And yet, its vision of who humans might be 300 years from now frequently puts me into a deep and complicated psychic space.Buy Starfield: Amazon | Best Buy | GameStopYou start off as a miner on a distant world who uncovers a strange object which, upon contact, gives you intense, incomprehensible visions. Soon after, you find yourself being recruited by a group of space explorers known as Constellation, joining up with them to seek out other artifacts like the one you found. This endeavor is at the heart of Starfield’s main story.Along the way, you’ll encounter tons of opportunities to engage in other quests, work for other factions, pick up odd jobs, and engage in a bit of freelance exploration of your own. But it’s that main story, which sends you around the galaxy as you hunt down the remainder of the vision-inducing artifacts, which bears Starfield’s strongest narrative offering. In fact, it’s the most memorable main quest I’ve played in a Bethesda game in some time (though to be fair, in some Bethesda games, it’s the side quests that are the real stars of the show). There are mysteries at play in Starfield which are never spelled out, and that preserves a sense of wonder. When the big, concrete revelations do come, they offer satisfying answers without depriving the cosmos of its awe-inspiring mystique. And instead of just spouting exposition at you for completing the quest, Starfield packages its sci-fi elements into a neat game mechanic at the conclusion, one that I’ll hold off on spoiling in this review.Starfield establishes early on that humanity spread across the galaxy because we had no other choice: Earth lost its atmosphere and became completely uninhabitable. The game is set 150 years after that cataclysmic event and portrays a world in which corporations own entire planets, humans are still fighting in wars with one another, and the most unfortunate members of society must now contend with living in the most inhospitable places humanity has ever known. The journeys you undertake on the main quest give you a bird’s eye perspective on the state of humanity across the cosmos, and it’s a complicated one, more pessimistic than I expected. Intentionally or not, Starfield largely suggests that losing Earth wouldn’t be enough for us as a species to overcome greed and the perpetuation of harm and suffering upon each other. To me, it suggests that pioneer-minded discovery is perhaps a distraction from addressing real systemic issues in our world. Or, in the case of Starfield, worlds. There’s real thematic potential lingering in Starfield, but unfortunately, despite providing fodder for these kinds of thoughts and perspectives, the game frequently fails to rise above mere potential and make the most of the ideas it’s working with. Its environmentalist critique of industrial society feels like a footnote. Still, I don’t walk away from Starfield with just mindless excitement over video games and epic space-faring science fiction. No, I’m hit with grief over climate change and fear over how humans treat one another. The lyrics to Gojira’s “A Sight to Behold” in particular have been stuck in my head ever since playing this game, and not just the references to climate change and war, but also that of a “lust for comfort” and how “entertainment becomes an obsession” amidst a dying planet and warring nations. But these themes hardly have a thrilling new vision of the future to support them. No, for all its scale, Starfield’s narrative essence is woefully plain. Where Fallout has its own distinctive, anachronistic charm and The Elder Scrolls has a diversity of landscapes, cultures, architecture, and traditions to give its world character, Starfield is a galaxy in search of an identity. Its “lore” feels like a few different science fiction franchises smushed together and then boiled down to a narrative substrate, the hollow outline of something much more interesting than what you ever see in the actual game. Clearly, it draws more on the “grounded” sci-fi of material like Star Trek and The Expanse than it does the high space fantasy of Star Wars and Destiny, which isn’t inherently bad, of course. However, it does so in a way that emphasizes their utilitarian view of the future while largely overlooking the elements that make them compelling. Just a dash of space opera fun could have gone a long way in livening up the game’s tone. And yet, in spite of itself, Starfield does feel rather special. It amounts to something more than the sum of its parts. I’ve dismissed many games for having the same issues you can’t escape in Starfield, yet here I am, still playing this one, still thinking about it constantly.Starfield was marketed as a role-playing game and comes from a studio known for them, but it relies so much on first-person shooter combat that I feel less inclined to compare it to other sci-fi RPGs and space exploration games like Mass Effect and No Man’s Sky than I do to shooters like Borderlands or Destiny. The central role of guns and shooting was a painful lesson for me early on in Starfield, especially with all of the different ammo types you need to keep track of. Over time you can get the hang of it, relying on dedicated weapons and spotting which ammo types you need to stuff into your inventory. That said, very few pivotal moments in the game give you any other option besides grabbing a gun and going bang-bang-bang. Combat’s long been a core part of Bethesda’s narrative RPGs, but this one wants you to resort to slaughter more than ever. Thankfully, Starfield also has the most refined combat in a Bethesda game yet. This is a solid improvement over Fallout 4’s gunplay, though it still feels a little bit behind a dedicated shooter like Call of Duty or Halo. Read More: My Pacifist Starfield Run Isn’t Going GreatBuy Starfield: Amazon | Best Buy | GameStopThe shooting mechanics do feel great (that is unless a bug prevents you from shooting—yes, that can happen). But unfortunately for a game that so often wants you to be shooting things, the spaces in which you engage in combat don’t compare to those in most shooters, nor does the AI particularly impress with tactical decisions or meaningfully varied enemy types. Get a good enough weapon and you can absentmindedly mow folks down. But Starfield can still be fun to play as a shooter, especially when you consider the presence of jet packs, low gravity environments, and a unique arsenal of techniques that bend reality a bit. On rare occasions I’ve even felt like a Destiny Guardian, as if Starfield were the single-player Destiny I’ve always wanted. The shallowness of the AI, however, and the lack of the kind of fluidity you find in the best shooters, means that the gunplay loses its luster before too long. It can be thrilling in bursts, but you’ll soon desire other activities in this galaxy.The same is true of ship combat. In bursts, it’s fun (especially if Barrett, one of your potential companions, is on board to lend his personality to moments of victory and defeat), but like those you experience on foot with a gun in hand, Starfield’s ship-based shootouts feel like they take place in too limiting of an environment, with AI that’s only a substantial challenge if you’ve failed to level up your ship’s combat abilities through upgrades and skills. While you’ll spend much of Starfield looking down the barrel of a gun, you also have access to RPG skills such as stealth, improved space travel, and persuasion abilities, but they’re gated behind a skill tree which you progress through at a snail’s pace. Crafting and outpost building in particular demand that you overcome an uphill battle of meeting constant prerequisites before things get interesting. Despite a bevy of unlockable skills across categories like Social, Tech, and Science, the lack of interesting quest design means that shooting crap is by and large what you do.The best open-world games make you feel like you’re in a believable place with a satisfying sense of scale. These worlds shatter the concept of “levels” in a video game and provide you with a singularly large space for you to inhabit, explore, save, or perhaps conquer. Executed well, open-world games like Fallout 4 or Skyrim sell the illusion of a non-linear world that exists beyond the life of your character. It’s a space to wander, a space that invites discovery and sight-seeing, with the understanding that you can actually go to that mountain peak or mysterious structure you can see in the distance. Starfield, however, offers a world that is far too fractured to create this illusion of wholeness and connection. You don’t directly fly to and land on planets like you do in No Man’s Sky. Instead, you chart your course through the cosmos via several layers of menus which don’t always make sense and which reduce the experience of intragalactic travel to one of selecting abstracted dots and icons on a map. And that’s complicated by early learning pains with the UI, which has a variety of different ways for you to “chart” a path, land directly on a planet, or go to a specific place, not to mention various shortcuts that aren’t spelled out, like the ability to go immediately to the star map by holding down the menu button. On mouse and keyboard it’s a bit better, with dedicated keys like L to go straight to your quest log or P to go to your skills. But on a gamepad, navigating the menu requires a bit of memorization before it feels natural—and even once you’ve spent some time with it, it still feels clunky.Once planetside, there’s a wide variety of different “biomes” to explore, and plenty of random placement of interior spaces, but it’s all segmented from the heart of the game’s quests through loading screens and menus, all so frequent and numerous that they undermine the illusion that this is actually all one cohesive space.Sure, loading screens exist for towns and buildings in previous Bethesda games and plenty of other games as well. But the best open worlds conjure a persuasive sense of cohesion and freedom in spite of these little breaks. You might spot a place in the distance and indulge your desire to walk somewhere, visiting a place only to satisfy your digital wanderlust. Seeing a town atop a hill go from part of the horizon to a place you’re now standing in is part of the theater of these games. That free-roaming experience is not really here in the same way in Starfield. You may glimpse it from time to time when wandering planets, but the defining settlements—where the important people live, where the history and lore of the world is made—aren’t part of the natural flow of wandering. It’s a dramatic loss.In Starfield, you select a planet and touch down in a pre-designated area (which prompts a loading screen) or an area you select on the 3D-rendered planetary map. Once you’re on the surface, you can catalog material resources, plant life, animals, and specific planetary “Traits.” There may also be dungeons to plunder, or friendly NPCs who will give you minor quests like “go kill these damn space pirates 700 meters from here.” You can also build outposts on these planets, though games like Fallout 4 have offered more freedom of design and aesthetic expression in their similar systems. Instead, Starfield’s outposts serve a more utilitarian purpose, providing dedicated spaces to mine for and store natural resources for crafting, commerce, and leveling up. Some may find satisfying mechanical depth in all this, while others are likely to bemoan the laborious monotony it can elicit. ""Over 1,000 planets await you after 3,000 loading and menu screens!""Open-world spacefaring RPGThought-provoking main quest and gorgeous planetary spaces to wander.Frustrating lack of player choice in narrative moments and repetitive interior spaces.BethesdaXbox Series X/S, PCSeptember 6, 2023150 hours, including the entire main quest, three new game plus completions, all faction quests, countless side quests, and plenty of sightseeing and wandering.Personally, I’m digging outpost building. I expect that many who loved Fallout 4’s settlements won’t find as much joy here, but maintaining and establishing outposts is proving to be a really satisfying management game that encourages me to explore this universe and map out cargo supply routes across the galaxy. I recently spun up a new character to ignore as many quests as I can and simply live life managing outposts, and I’m excited about moving through the game this way.Outposts, along with ship building, allow for a nice amount of customization and a feeling that you’re playing an active role in creating a unique space of your own. Ship building could stand to allow more customization of its interior spaces, however. You don’t have much control over what’s inside your ship, and making serious changes in the ship builder can result in all those mugs, plushies, Newton’s cradles, and other knick-knacks you’ve collected and placed around your cabin getting tossed into your ship’s inventory, wrecking all progress made decorating the space.You can engage in these ambient planetside activities of violence, exploration, sightseeing, and outpost management to your heart’s content. It’s kind of like a space-themed zen garden kit you can just mindlessly sift through. It can be rather soothing, if I’m being honest.Read More: Starfield Is So Chill I Keep Falling AsleepBuy Starfield: Amazon | Best Buy | GameStopOn specific worlds, however, there are dedicated towns, but only a few. There’s the city of New Atlantis on Jemison, the underground town of Cydonia on Mars, Akila City on Akila, Neon on Volii Alpha, and a few others. Like so much of Starfield, every major settlement is gated behind at least two or three menu and loading screens. Where locations in the best open-world games feel like places that permanently exist and are situated within a living world, Starfield’s galaxy feels like a file structure in my computer’s operating system. Read More: Starfield’s Local Planet Map Is HorribleThat said, planetary environments can be simply gorgeous to walk around in. And the procedurally generated natural spaces you explore often feel dynamic enough that, while you’ll spot some similarities here and there, most worlds you touch down on feel distinct. Navigating the terrain is slow (there are no vehicles, just a jet pack which kinda sorta helps), but I find it rewarding. I’ve spent the equivalent of nearly six days straight in this game, putting me at right around 150 hours of total playtime, and most of that has been spent blissfully soaking in and wandering about these planets. And I don’t intend on stopping. Taking in the sights of an epic mountain, or coming across the top of a hill to see the rings of Saturn fill the night sky, hasn’t gotten old. I get pleasantly lost in these environments very easily, enjoying the space, the walk, the calm. Just as I love listening to a work of ambient music that stems from a musical process just flowing through a modular synth patch, so too do I enjoy the gentle emergence of mountainscapes, forests, looming planets, and gorgeous starry skies. I just wish I could come across towns and major settlements in the same organic way.Read More: Starfield’s Photo Mode Is Deeply SatisfyingInterior environments of the kind you’ll randomly explore, however, are dramatically repetitive. Far too often, that “abandoned mining facility” you decide to check out looks identical to one you just came from in another star system. Why there’s seemingly no procedural generation at work for interior environments, or at least more variations of these pre-fabricated spaces, is just jarringly weird. It dramatically threatens the feeling of exploration when you see the same broken catwalk in the same mining facility every time. The same is true for certain planetary “Traits,” distinct natural occurrences like the remnants of a glacier, a crystal formation, or a meteor crater. These repeat so often during planetary exploration that it breaks the illusion that you’re exploring a natural place. On many worlds, you’ll need to scan these features in order to completely survey a planet (you can then sell the survey data to vendors). So coming across the same melted glacier, covered crater, or swampy puddle gets old quick. Granted, it might be reasonable to expect reused assets to crop up here and there across 1,000 planets, but it was Bethesda’s choice to fill this game with so many planets in the first place. And there’s not even an effort to make it appear like these are generic prefabs that this society is using, not when boxes, vehicles, medpacks, and lockers are all placed in the exact same place, every time; a smaller overall scale would’ve made this repetition feel less notable for sure.So, Starfield’s exploration bogs you down in layers of unintuitive menus and sends you down the halls of blatantly repetitive interior spaces, yet there remains a deep satisfaction to be had in charting out these worlds, immersing yourself in the pleasure of just digitally existing somewhere as you take in beautiful cosmic sights. What happens, though, when you tire of sightseeing? What if you’re looking for some thrilling heroics? Unfortunately, Starfield’s quests leave much—much—to be desired, with gameplay that just brutally disappoints.In addition to its main quest line, Starfield features four faction quest lines of varying mission length, four companion quest lines, and dozens and dozens of random things you’ll find needing done around its worlds. That’s in addition to the more rote “go kill these pirates” quests you may pick up from random NPCs or from mission boards found throughout the galaxy.With the exception of the final arc of the main story (and maybe bits of the UC faction quest), I pursued almost none of these quests for their narrative intrigue, and found virtually nothing interesting to do in them. Starfield’s environments may border on photorealism, but its character dialogue and narrative premises are a puppet show of trite conversations and meager offerings to the player. I didn’t feel a need to act in this world for any genuine reason. I was merely checking things off a list, and by goddess do the NPCs of this world have lists and tasks and meaningless busywork for you to do. It almost makes you wonder how anything ever gets done here. But though you’re clearly the center of the damn universe with the way everyone spills their life story to you at the drop of a hat, there’s a dramatically impoverished level of player choice in Starfield. Granted, I didn’t come here expecting an immersive sim, but when literally stealing a plot object always alerts the entire ship personnel and nets me a bounty regardless of how many points I invested in stealth and the fact that no one saw me touch it, I’m deprived of an opportunity to roleplay my character in my own way. And in that case, just what the hell was stealth for this entire time? When my options as someone investigating crimes across the galaxy are to either kill the person responsible or let them continue to get away with it by paying me off, with no room in the middle for anything else, the quest feels like playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons with the most railroad-y DM imaginable. And I can’t even go back to the person in charge of my quest to talk to them about the difficult situation before being given the forced decision to take a deeply unethical bribe or, um, bludgeon someone to death with a rescue ax.This lack of choice and interesting outcomes is at the heart of Starfield’s failure to ever provide interesting challenges beyond pointing and shooting. At one point during the game’s many “go play space cop” quests, I wanted to find a non-violent solution with an antagonist. I used my maxed-out Persuasion skill to make them stop attacking me and then approached them for a conversation. The game simply cycled me through the exact same conversation I’d just had with them before the fight with the exact same outcome as before. Starfield is largely on rails, with occasional choices at the points of departure.And even when you want to pull a Trevor Philips because those suits at Paradiso unleash your inner murder space cadet, so many characters have invincible plot armor that it makes the game feel like a theme park, with the main attractions gated off and unalterable.There could be room to excuse this if I were talking about bottom-of-the-barrel quests tucked away somewhere in a random location. But the poverty of choice and interesting outcomes from main feature questlines makes for a dramatically shallow experience at the very heart of Starfield’s narrative moments.All of this is to say nothing of the frequent bugs that make this predominantly milquetoast gaming experience tip over into frustration. You name it, I’ve experienced it: Quests that will never ever complete despite my doing everything I’m supposed to do; a ship that constantly makes clicking sounds no matter how many times I repair it; my ship landing inside of a planet; my ship landing inside a perpetual state of blinding light; my companion Sam Coe’s daughter never coming aboard my ship despite him constantly referring to her as being there (that’s a fun one to headcanon); and there are still two damn scientists stuck in my ship for some reason who, upon seeing me, say “I really hope I get to see my family again” every single time.Starfield can be boring, and it can be a total mess. And yet in spite of all that, I can’t stop thinking about it.Starfield dramatically falls short in its attempts to be so many games at once. Its world is segmented and lifeless, with a frustrating learning curve before seamless navigation ever feels possible. Its various skills brush up against rigid quest structures, denying you the freedom to use them in clever ways. Yet it features beautiful visuals which you can peacefully take in, making you feel grounded in its spectacular galaxy, and does satisfy that itch of just rummaging through crap and collecting things. There is a joy to be had in just checking things off lists and going through the motions of this kind of Bethesda game. And Starfield is capable of inspiring some deep and complicated thoughts and emotions, its vastness and narrative, for all its flaws, hinting at haunting meanings about our species and the path we’re on.In Starfield, many might see a time-tested, signature charm. Others might see a time-worn, laborious monotony. These are fair perspectives. A game this large is hard to distill into one set of strengths or one set of weaknesses. As in other Bethesda games before it, you’ll likely have to make your own fun here, but in giving us not just a swath of post-apocalyptic terrain or a fantasy realm but an entire galaxy to explore this time, Starfield makes all the flaws and shortcomings of its patchwork world all the more glaring.

Starfield was one of my most anticipated games of 2023. I love sci-fi, and the idea of captaining my own ship and exploring the cosmos has enthralled me for the three decades I’ve been alive. Unfortunately, gaming has a hard time capturing a topic on such a large scale. However, I hoped that Bethesda would get closer than any others had so far. Unfortunately, after playing the game, it seems the final frontier is still beyond our grasp.The main quest hook in Starfield is that you’re a simple space miner who’s stumbled onto an artifact while working. When you touched it, you saw visions and heard music. (It’s almost exactly the same idea as when Shepard touched the Prothean Beacon in Mass Effect, minus the apocalyptic portents.) You’re no worse for the wear, but then pirates show up looking for booty. Luckily, they’re incompetent, so you quickly kill them. Then another dude lands and tells you he had a similar experience and that you need to take the artifact to the HQ of some organization called Constellation. Then, he gives you his robot and ship and tells you to blast off.At this point, you’re free to do whatever. You don’t even have to complete the first story mission if you don’t want to. You can go join factions, level up, build ships and outposts, whatever. However, suppose you choose to meet Constellation at the Lodge in New Atlantis. In that case, you’ll learn that these artifacts are scattered throughout the galaxy, and the organization wants to gather them to see what they do.Despite humanity’s diaspora into space, they’ve never encountered other sentient life. So, your main impetus is to determine if these artifacts prove that there’s other intelligent beings out there. However, the main quest is just a small amount of the story content available in the game. There are multiple factional storylines and what seems like an endless amount of smaller mission chains and one-off quests throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately, it’s all an ocean-wide and a puddle deep.Starfield’s universe is a hodgepodge of ideas from other sci-fi properties. Of the main factions, United Colonies is a slightly nicer version of Starship Troopers’ United Citizen Federation, the FreeStar Collective is just Firefly, the Crimson Fleet are generic space pirates, Ryujin Industries is your typical cyberpunk-esque megacorp, and House Va’ruun is basically The Orville’s Krill or Riddick’s Necromongers.The game has a sterile feel that is surprising compared to Bethesda’s previous titles. Fallout and the Elder Scrolls were never afraid to get a little bloody or weird. However, there’s a distinct lack of that here. Space is a setting where you can really bust loose with horror and adventure, and while there are a few cool encounters and locations that tap into Bethesda’s roots, most places I visited felt like they were missing something.This is most obvious in the procedurally-generated content, which includes random outposts, caves, etc. Most of these are just filled with random space pirates or nasty little critters and lack any environmental storytelling. It’s fun collecting loot and clearing dungeons for a while, but eventually, the content starts to loop, and you get a feeling of deja vu as you pass through a building with the same structure and enemy placement as one you went through before.Companions are supposed to be a highlight of Bethesda games, but I found the four main followers in Starfield to be incredibly dull. The one I kept around for most of the game was Sarah, who only really spoke to me to give me some trash she found on the floor or to beat herself up and scold me when I told her not to be so hard on herself. Then you have Barrett, whose only personality trait is that he’s apparently “out there,” but in actuality is just slightly quirky. Shortly after the game started, I was introduced to Sam Coe, who has daddy issues and a daughter that only exists to echo how much she loves books through my ship. Rounding out the bunch is Andreja, who is portrayed as mysterious and violent but is instead incredibly vanilla and transparent.The biggest problem is that none of them had any force of personality, likely because Bethesda decided to play this universe way too straight. So, you won’t run into irritating, single-minded patriots like Preston Garvey, noir-detective androids like Nick Valentine, or kind-hearted outsiders like Fawkes. Instead, you have a bunch of ordinary people with ordinary people problems. That’s fine in real life, but when I’m out on the edge of the frontier trying to solve one of the greatest mysteries humanity has ever faced, I want some characters with me.It got to where I just started telling my companions to stay on the ship. They rarely factor into any quests you’re doing anyway. Around 40 hours in, I got tired of them telling me they had some mundane item to give me or asking me to talk about something that happened in the story 3-4 hours ago.You get a ship not long after the game begins, which had me pumped. Unfortunately, one of my most eagerly anticipated features of Starfield, the shipbuilding, is one of the most half-baked. The most infuriating aspect of it, though, is that you can’t choose where doors and ladders are placed. So, if you make a larger ship, you’re usually left with a labyrinth instead of a logical layout.Of course, even if you get a ship built that you like, there’s no real point in putting much thought into it because the interior is purposeless. You can assign crew to a ship, but you can’t tell them to work a particular station, so they just roam aimlessly through the corridors, occasionally stopping somewhere to pretend they’re taking inventory or working on a computer. They have different skills that supplement yours and give stat boosts to ship systems, but that’s all done behind the scenes without affecting how they behave.When Bethesda revealed you could have your own crew, I was excited at the possibilities. I had hoped you could do something relatively simple, like assigning a doctor to your ship’s infirmary and getting a bonus to health or free med packs. Instead, there’s no point to most ship modules. Instead, outside of the workshop, most of them are for show and serve no function other than to provide ambiance. Those that do serve a purpose just give you extra crew and passenger slots.Unfortunately, you can’t even decorate your ship because each time you change the layout, all the interior items are removed to your cargo hold. I speculate this is because the game just generates a new map for the interior each time instead of saving the state of each individual module. So, instead of just moving the items affected by a module being swapped out, it wipes the slate clean.Outposts are easier to customize but have similar issues. These are basically larger Fallout 4 settlements. However, unlike that game, where you could assign beds and jobs to give the illusion of life, you send crew members to a base, and they just roam around and play an animation like they’re working on a random task from time to time.The biggest issue with Outposts is that they’re relatively pointless. They can harvest resources from planets, grow plants in hydroponic modules, and automatically construct industrial parts. However, you only really need resources to craft mods for your gear, produce health items and stat boosters, and build more outposts. The catch is that you make so many credits by completing missions and selling loot that you can just buy the resources you need, making outposts superfluous.These would be a lot more fun if they acted like colonies, which would attract random NPCs to live and work there. You’d have a reason to keep an eye on outposts if you had to manage how many beds they had or meet your colonists’ needs. As is, the system feels unfinished.I was hoping that exploration would be the game’s saving grace. After all, there’s so much to see out there in Starfield’s galaxy. While the handcrafted stuff is high-quality for the most part (if a little bland), the procedurally generated elements end up hurting the experience.Previously, Bethesda said that you could land anywhere on a planet, pop your little head out, and explore to your heart’s content. That’s not a lie. You can travel to any planet, scan it, mark a location, and touch down. However, you’re not actually “landing” on the planet. Instead, each time you mark a random place (non-handcrafted) to touch down at, the game generates a new map based on what the biome is supposed to be and what resources, flora, and fauna belong there that don’t interact with any other part of the game.So, when you touch down next to an ocean on a balmy earth-like planet, you’ll see water, and there’ll be animals and plants to scan, but it’s just an abstraction. Touch down again right next to this location, and the game will generate another map that has zero interaction with the first. An egregious example would be that you can touch down just outside New Atlantis, and you won’t be able to see the city because the game doesn’t consider that it should be there in the distance.This ruined exploration because you’re never actually exploring a planet. You’re just generating random maps that have nothing to do with each other or the world you’re orbiting. I would rather there have been a limited number of landing sites on each planet, with the excuse that your ship can only touch down in the right kind of terrain or something. That would have at least maintained the illusion.Starfield would have been an impressive game ten years ago, but on a technical level, it’s not far beyond Skyrim or Fallout 4. The graphics have been updated, but it has the same issues that Bethesda games have had since Morrowind. Animations continue to be rough, and most NPCs look lifeless when they’re talking to you, which is exacerbated by the insistence on the awkward close-up camera during each conversation. Bugs abounded for me as well. Numerous conversations turned into slapstick as NPCs got stuck in their idle animation or continued walking away when speaking with me.Previous Bethesda games had a contiguous overworld, so loading wasn’t as noticeable or as often, but Starfield relies way too much on menus and loading screens. Where most games try to make the experience as immersive as possible, here you’re constantly loading into buildings, opening your menu to fast travel, loading as your ship jumps to a new star system, loading to land on a planet, loading to enter your cockpit, and loading to take off. Loading times are mercifully short on an SSD, but all these micro-interruptions add up.When scoring Starfield, I considered that many of my issues with the game were totally subjective. However, the game does have technical and design issues that can’t be ignored. Ironically, it has many of the same problems people relentlessly criticized Cyberpunk 2077 for, like lifeless crowds, a hollow wanted system, and glitchy animations, but it’s largely getting a pass. Bethesda deserves kudos for pioneering the modern Western RPG format, and I don’t think every game needs to be some innovative revolution. Despite this, Starfield is backed by Microsoft and produced by one of the biggest game companies in the world. There’s no reason it should feel and play like Fallout 4 in space.7Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkGround control to Major ToddOver the course of reviewing Starfield, I logged almost 100 hours. I spent them building outposts on exotic planets in distant star systems, and rising the ranks at my corporate “desk job” at Ryujin Industries in the cyberpunk-like city of Neon. I romanced Sarah, developing a relationship and—I think—getting married on a paradise planet, with beautiful and accurately orbiting moons looming above.I have a strange history with Bethesda Game Studios titles. Like many people, I’m a fan of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. But maybe less like most people, I’ve never completed any of them. It has nothing to do with the quality, but these games were just always missing some sort of hook to dig into me personally, to keep me playing.It might be easy to recommend Starfield because it’s a Bethesda game. You’ve spent hundreds or thousands of hours in other Bethesda titles, so why not this one as well? But I want to tell you why Starfield deserves to be played. Not just because it’s a Bethesda title, but because it’s a truly incredible experience that I enjoyed every second of the way. One that, even now, I’m itching to return to.Starfield (PC[reviewed], Xbox Series X|S) Developer: Bethesda Game Studios Publisher: Bethesda Softworks Released: September 6, 2023 MSRP: $69.99Your open-world adventure in Starfield begins just as we saw in the Starfield Direct back in June. You are a new employee of Argos Mining at a new mining site where a strange object has been discovered. As the new guy, you’re sent in to check out and obtain the object so it can be sold to a buyer. Upon touching the object, you have an intense vision that causes you to temporarily black out.When you wake up, the buyer has arrived. The buyer is Barrett, a member of Constellation, an organization dedicated to space exploration and finding out the secrets of the galaxy. Barrett informs you that due to your interaction with the object—which he calls an Artifact—you should be the one to take it back to the other Constellation members.But it turns out Barrett was being tracked by some pirates who want to take the Artifact off your hands. This is our first taste of combat in Starfield, a big part of this open-world RPG.Fans of the combat system in previous Bethesda Fallout titles will feel right at home. There is no VATS, but most of the other staple gunplay is there. There are many different types of weapons types including rifles, pistols, shotguns, swords, and more. You can also utilize various different types of grenades, land mines, and other explosives. You’ll find a plethora of weapons throughout your adventure with unique attachments, modifications, and bonuses. In true RPG fashion, these bonuses increase the stats on your weapon, making them more effective.The combat in Starfield is fluid and fast-paced. As you progress you’ll find better weapons that keep combat fresh and fun. You’ll also gain other other effects over the course of the story that further evolve combat in interesting ways. There are constantly new additions to your combat arsenal, allowing you to strategize to take down tougher enemies many levels higher than you. Of course, you can have a companion nearby to help out as well. You can even give them specific weapons and gear you want them to use, which is definitely worth doing.Some of the best weapons I found inflicted various status effects such as corrosive or fire damage. Crafting weapons lets you get exactly the type of gameplay you’re looking for, too. Want to get up close and personal? Use a powerful shotgun and melee weapon combo. Prefer to keep it at range? Try a long rifle and assault rifle setup. Up to ten weapons can be equipped in quick slots at a time, so you can easily adapt to any sort of fight. However, these slots are also used for other actions like healing via consumables.Eventually, you’ll find yourself engaged in combat in space as well. You’ll start with the Constellation ship Barrett gives you, but will eventually outgrow it. Space combat itself is more active, as opposed to a space sim; more like Everspace 2 than Elite Dangerous. You also have to manage where power is being routed to your ship in real time, which can be exhilarating in the middle of a space battle, as you route power between weapons, engines, and shields. Oh, and don’t forget to save some power for the grav-drive, just in case you have to warp out to prevent losing your ship.Ships have their own stats too, and some ships have their own special focus. Early on, I actually stole a ship from a mining outpost that had a massive cargo hold. It wasn’t the best in combat, but the player can upgrade every aspect of their ship, including its weapons. For those just wanting a quick upgrade, you can do so by simply purchasing a better ship part that automatically replaces the existing one. But if you’re feeling more creative, there’s an intricate and in-depth ship-building system where you can literally build and upgrade your ship piece by piece.Overall, even the slightest ship upgrades are worthwhile. I was once having trouble taking out some higher-level pirate ships for a side mission so I decided to upgrade the weapons on my ship and give it another try. Before, I was barely making a scratch to their shields and hull HP, but with the new upgrades I was decimating both.After taking out the pirates you will head to New Atlantis, the capital city of the United Colonies. It is here you will meet your fellow Constellation members. Afterward, the main story of Starfield begins as the player is tasked with tracking down more of these Artifacts and trying to figure out their purpose. At this point, Starfield becomes a massive open-world sandbox. From here on out your journey is whatever you want it to be.Personally, I did a little bit of everything. This is where Starfield really shines: the freedom to do what you want in a massive sandbox. I’d often warp to a system where I planned to complete a main story mission, only to encounter someone needing my help. Hours later, I’d be lightyears away from where I originally warped, constructing a new outpost and genuinely forgetting how I got there. I didn’t help because it felt like I needed to, but rather I wanted to. The writing in Starfield is top-notch, even in side missions that may seem like an inconsequential part of the galaxy.There’s really so much to do in Starfield. For those into exploration, you can literally scan every planet and moon in the entire game. Each planet has its own resources, flora, fauna, and special landmark sites on them. Finding and scanning everything a planet has to offer will grant Survey Data, which you can then sell for a nice profit or return to Constellation to advance their exploration efforts.Resources aren’t just for looks, either. You can mine various deposits scattered amongst the surface by hand, or even build a mining outpost to extract resources from a planet while you are away. Over time you can even build up your outpost to have production facilities as well, converting your resources into various manufactured goods. Eventually, you can have several outposts on various different planets all automatically sending resources to each other. Starfield essentially takes the settlement building from Fallout 4 and cranks it up to 100. And at the end of the day, this is still just one of the many things to do in Starfield.In fact, a lot of the fully fleshed-out activities could literally be their own game. I spent hours climbing the ranks of the corporate ladder of Ryujin Industries, a megacorporation in the city of Neon. Not because I had to, mind you. In fact, I’m sure some people may never even experience this part of Starfield. Ryujin Industries is your typical corrupt megacorporation, doing anything to increase profits. My first job was to do a coffee run to the Terrabrew down the street, but before I knew it I was planting evidence and considering assassinating a high-value competitor. I won’t say Ryujin is Starfield‘s Dark Brotherhood… but maybe?Over the course of my playthrough, I did a little bit of everything. Whatever Starfield threw my way, I was excited to try. I once stole an item worth a measly 500 credits—it was an honest mistake, I swear—and didn’t even realize I had the stolen item on me. Apparently, there was now a 550 credit bounty on my head, and a United Colonies ship spotted me leaving a planet and apprehended me. I definitely didn’t think all this fuss was worth it over a measly 550 credits. But on board, the ship captain, a higher-up in the UC military, basically blackmailed me into working for the UC to have my charges dropped, or face harsher penalties. This started a whole new plot line where I was now infiltrating the most infamous pirate gang, the Crimson Fleet, as a double agent for the United Colonies. I’m not joking when I say this entire plotline could have been its own game.In total, there are 80 different skills across five different trees from which to choose when building out a character in Starfield. Each skill also has four ranks, requiring the previous rank and completion of a challenge tied to it to unlock the preceding rank. And each successive rank is better than the previous.The physical tree focuses on skills that increase your physical prowess. This includes melee damage but also health, carrying capacity, food and drink effectiveness, and more. For those more interested in how they socialize with others in Starfield, the social tree give increases your efficiency with things like diplomacy, intimidation, and persuasion. The combat tree—as the name would imply—focuses primarily on increasing combat effectiveness, such as increasing damage with certain weapon types. The science tree enhances your scientific capabilities, such as scanning and outpost efficiency, and even increases the resources obtained by mining and harvesting. Finally, the tech tree focuses primarily on increasing the effectiveness of your ships, as well as hacking (lockpicking) and how you interact with robotics.With so many options, you can really specialize your character however you want. You get a skill point to place every time you level up, and there is no max level. So in theory, you can always keep leveling up and obtaining new skills. To give you a rough idea of how many skills one might obtain, I was level 35 when I completed the main story missions.I’m sure a lot of people are going to be updating their desktop wallpaper after playing Starfield. Bethesda has created a beautiful piece of our galaxy, in many different ways. I don’t think I’ve ever played a game where I’ve stopped and enjoyed the view so much. My PC is certainly not a beast by any means. In fact, my CPU is over five years old and my video card, the RTX 2080 Super, is several series behind. But Starfield is extremely well-optimized. I was able to maintain 60FPS or higher for most of my playthrough on High settings. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, reminding me a lot of Interstellar. There’s not a single track I didn’t enjoy, and they all fit with the theme of space and exploration.Visuals and music aren’t the only beautiful parts of Starfield, though. Many characters have their own charming personality as well. This is enhanced by the facial animations in Starfield which are vastly improved over previous Bethesda titles. Over time connections are built with your Constellation companions. Throughout your adventure, they’ll often join you as a companion or crew member on your ship. They each have their own reason for being part of Constellation, as well as their own side missions that further flesh out their story. You’ll have to make some tough choices along the way, and in turn, there are some rough consequences. There’s some real weight behind the decisions you’ll make, which maintains its intensity throughout the entire game.There are moments when the beautiful surroundings and intriguing characters come together so well that creates a very realistic feeling. The stakes can be high in Starfield, but sometimes you have to stop and take in the beauty as well. I’m purposefully keeping this review spoiler-free, but know that some of the big-picture narratives of Starfield hit pretty hard. The ending won’t be for everyone; but for me, as the credits rolled, I sat and thought for a while about life, the universe, and my interpretation of it. A definite first for me after completing a game.Even though this is Bethesda’s biggest game yet, it may also be its least buggy. Sure there are some trademark silly Bethesda title bugs, like characters loading in bald with no hair, or NPC’s getting stuck walking into a chair or behind held in place by a little mug on the floor. But throughout my nearly 100 hours I never once encountered anything game-breaking.There are definitely some things I feel could enhance the Starfield experience even further. Even though you can land right next to mission objectives and points of interest on a planet, it would have been nice to have access to some sort of planetary vehicles or even rideable creatures to get around a bit easier. This is especially true when taking on the task of trying to survey and scan an entire planet. Some plants and creatures only exist in specific biomes, and it can be a long-haul trekking from one to another.I also think it would have been a great touch to be able to actually fly your ship down onto a planet, or fly around in a planet’s atmosphere as opposed to only landing and lifting off. Not only would this be fun, but it would help add to the freedom of being able to truly explore a planet.Upon completing Starfield you do unlock a New Game Plus mode. Interestingly, NG+ is actually intertwined with the story of Starfield, which is pretty unique and very intriguing. I will say that the bit of NG+ I have played has been just as fun as my first playthrough. Without spoiling anything, I can confirm it adds a ton of replayability to Starfield and even more content to experience in an already massive open-world game.I’ll be honest, even as I wrap this up, I still feel like I’ve forgotten to include some of the incredible features Starfield has to offer. I know I left out a lot of memorable moments I experienced throughout my play. Realistically, this review could be triple the length it already is. But I don’t want that; I don’t want to spoil anything. Starfield is a truly incredible experience that will be special for everyone. Explore the piece of the galaxy Bethesda has created how you want to, and create your own stories. It’s where Starfield really excels.I wasn’t sure if it could be done, but Bethesda has managed to raise the bar for sandbox games even higher. In the end, Starfield is an epic sandbox open-world RPG with a beautifully immersive universe, a captivating story, and fun and compelling gameplay the whole way. I’m so happy to have experienced Starfield organically, and I really hope you get to as well.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

Forbes,"StarfieldThe weight of expectations on Starfield and in turn, Bethesda, has been crushing. It’s not just their first mainline single player game since 2015’s Fallout 4, but a recovery effort from the rocky launch of Fallout 76. Oh, and after being acquired for $7.5 billion, Bethesda now has to make Starfield Microsoft’s flagship franchise since Master Chief is on an indefinite vacation.And they do it. They pull it off. Starfield is going to make a lot of people happy.The word you are going to hear thrown around the most here is “scale.” This is a massive game. So much so that even two weeks and 80+ hours into it, there is a ton I’m missing, even if I’ve gone through the main story and major faction quests. And then there’s just pure, seemingly endless exploration, if you simply want to do that.Starfield excels at the things Bethesda usually excels at; sprawling worlds which you can exist in for anywhere from 50 to 500 hours or more. Multiple ways to take on missions, unforeseen effects of your choices that circle back around in ways you don’t expect. It is also sometimes weak at the things Bethesda is weak at. Character modeling, while improved, still feels very dated. And the main story is…questionable, with the best stories being many of the sidequests or even just random things that happen to you in the world.But there is one way that Starfield breaks from past Bethesda games. Its action-based combat is genuinely quite good. That is obviously something I’ve never said about a single Fallout game, where outside of VATS, is one of the worst-feeling shooters in the AAA space. That is not true here. Combat is fast, mainly thanks to the new jetpack (I recommend this being the first thing you max), which zips you across and up and down the map rapidly, and it gets even wilder in lower gravity zones. It’s frenetic and quite fun.StarfieldThe shooting itself feels solid, easily the best in any Bethesda Game Studios title. It’s certainly not Call of Duty or Destiny, but I’d probably rank its gunplay above the recent Cyberpunk 2077. This was the thing that surprised me the most, though I know there will also be fans of its spaceship battling system as well. It’s not as intuitive as on-the-ground shooting, I suppose, but the dogfights are satisfying and there are some interesting aspects in here, an FTL-lite system of powering up different areas of your ship in different situations, losing those systems in a fight, or shooting out the systems in other ships you’re fighting. You can, as Bethesda has said, kill a ship’s engines specifically, board it, and take everything on it, including the ship itself. I mostly just blew everything up.There is of course context for all of this shooting. That would be the main storyline where you, a random no-name miner, comes into contact with a mysterious metal object of unknown origin that gives you weird visions. Turns out there are a lot of these, and a group called Constellation has been collecting them and trying to figure out what exactly it is they do. They are starry-eyed explorers, and four of its members will become your “core team” on your ship, though you can recruit a dozen or so other people, either folks you meet on quests or random hires you find in bars if you just need someone to farm dirt at your planetary base.The main quest is hunting down these artifacts, where they may be deep in a mine full of raiders, or you may have to plan a heist on a space baron’s luxury cruiser. Eventually, you will start getting answers to your questions, but the meat of the game really is not the main quest, it’s everything else.The best structured quests, as is the case with many past Bethesda games, are the faction quests. My two favorites are both with the UC planetary authority, ie. space cops. The first has you dealing with the remnants of a horrific monster alien plague starting to resurge. The second, probably the best quest in the game, has you playing double or triple agent between the UC and the Crimson Fleet pirates, infiltrating the organization, and picking a side by the end.StarfieldYou are not hard locked into just one faction, other than the “pick one” spy mission I just mentioned. You can also become a Freestar Ranger, space sheriffs as opposed to space cops, I suppose. You can push paper for Ryujin Industries, in a series of (I thought pretty boring) stealth and espionage missions.Outside of the factions, there are scores of other quests. You can join minor gangs to eliminate major ones. Lead a citizen rebellion against local pirates. Quests can be almost hilariously minor, one is literally getting a drink for a woman from across the galaxy. And they can come from anywhere. A random, overheard conversation at a bar led me on a Fallout-style, insanely wacky quest that eventually involved meeting…well, let me just say you will truly never believe who my current companion is. And of course, you can do an involved “loyalty quest” for each of your main party members.Bethesda wanted to lean more into companions this time around, but I’d say that this, and general character relationships, is where the game suffers a bit. This isn’t Mass Effect, despite being structured the same way with a central ship. And god help Bethesda that they had to come out just weeks after Baldur’s Gate 3, which has the best voice acting, animation and writing of any party-based game possibly…ever.The standout companion is Sam Coe, an ex-Freestar Ranger and space cowboy voiced by someone you should recognize immediately, Elias Toufexis, Adam Jensen of Deus Ex. His story was the most compelling involving his daughter, ex-wife and his previous smuggling days, and it feels like palling around with Justified’s Raylan Givens. The others just don’t quite land as well, including the “main” NPC you’ve seen all over the promo materials, Sarah Morgan, who is…fine, but I didn’t really connect with her, nor Barrett, the wannabe comedian explorer you meet first. I did connect with a mysterious woman named Andreja, a Constellation member who I chose as my singular romance in my playthrough. But “romance” here is writing like “hey I love you.” “I’m happy you said that, I love you too.” It’s not exactly going to go down as one of the all-time great love stories of our time. And if you want to be a wholly evil space pirate, I would leave all of these guys at home, as they are uh, pretty judgy of indiscriminate murder.StarfieldThere are more interesting characters out in the world. I found myself appreciating the smaller moments here, like a store clerk at a luxury space beach resort who is visibly annoyed to be there and laments that her uncle got her the job, but she thought it would be something higher up. While she’s essentially no one, she’s representative of the scores of unique personalities and character quirks to be found across the galaxy.All this dialogue leads to probably the biggest visual weakness of the game. Bethesda’s character models are still not very good. They’re better than they were, but that was a low bar, and it feels dated compared to every other game in this space. It’s a little more emotive than in the past, but in way that feels like someone typed “be more emotive” into the code rather than allowing something like actual performance capture to come through. The voicework is good, the animation is not.So yes, you will no doubt see screenshots of characters in Starfield looking ugly, or landscapes in the game looking bad, as there are lots of barren planets, as expected.But man, there is a whole lot of beauty. A whole lot. I have been taking a huge album of photos as I’ve gone through the game, and there are set moments where the game presents you with some genuinely jaw-dropping vistas that you simply have to stop and stare at. But while many of these are “planned” big moments, most of them aren’t. I have taken random photos on random planets, even some of those fully “dead” ones, and found stunning sights there too. White hot sunsets on a desolate moon. A giant, rainbow dinosaur frolicking on a jungle planet.StarfieldMoving outside the story to exploration, those thousand planets and custom ships and custom bases and such, yes, it’s all very No Man’s Sky. Xbox fans were shouting down anyone who made that comparison before launch, but it is literally using enormous elements and systems straight from that game. You mine things, you scan and catalogue things, you chart planets and star systems. You establish home planets and operating bases. This, as I’ve said many times, is not an insult, as No Man’s Sky has become a great game over the years. Starfield’s sandbox is miles ahead of where No Man’s Sky was at launch, but perhaps not quite where it has arrived at now, as Hello Games has crafted some truly impressive planet diversity and features. However, I think Starfield does a better job with what you do on those planets and moons.I will admit I have only done a cursory amount of ship and base customization. I planted a beacon on a totally random, totally gorgeous moon I found with blue palm trees and a view of a ringed gas giant and I built a little workshop. I made another base on a moon full of high level creatures I could farm for XP. But that’s about all I’ve done. I’ve seen enough Fallout 76 to know, however, that the tools are here to make some impressive things, which I am sure the community will begin pumping out quickly. But I am not that guy.However, I really do like zero objective, mindless exploration in this game a lot more than I thought I would. One generic Constellation bounty told me I had to go to a star system and find a planet with a “turbulent lithosphere,” some sort of anomaly trait you have to explore around and scan for in the landscape. I spent three hours doing this, hopping between planets and moon, farming resources, cataloging plants and alien animals. I found random outposts and mines and bandit bases. I gained three levels. I found two legendary weapons. One thing I did not find was a turbulent lithosphere, but I got ten times the XP and credits that mission would have netted me anyway. And I had fun the whole time.StarfieldThese have been some of the best moments for me, essentially just picking places at random, going there and…seeing what’s there. Yes, it’s procedurally generated, yes, you will eventually see some things starting to repeat. But after dozens and dozens of hours I was still seeing new things. Ruined biolabs taken over by hostile creatures. Desolate ships in orbit with murder mysteries to solve. One thing I did just before I started writing this was go to a planet, land in a place with no icons and I found an industrial plant nearby. It was taken over by mercenaries. I killed them all, par for the course, but this time, I found they had left their ship behind. So I went inside and found an entire crew there, killed them too, and then I found myself in the possession of my very own, hulking, class C pirate flagship. Duty free. Again, found by throwing a dart at a random location on a random planet in a random star system with zero prompting from the game itself.There are star systems that aren’t on the map. There are planets with POIs that only appear when scanned. At a certain point, after the campaign and most side missions are done, you really just craft your own goals. I’m currently trying to max combat and ship skills at level 65. I just found a katana, a first after 80 hours. I collect outfits, which are largely cosmetic (yay no microtransactions) and take fun photos in them (I just found a cowboy poncho and hat). You make your own game, eventually.There are annoyances that will crop up, certainly, breaking immersion with the all good parts. The game’s oxygen system is terrible, the worst kind of sprint recovery system you can imagine. Upgrading it makes it mildly less terrible but it takes forever to even do that. Eighty hours in I have not even hit the requirement for getting to the final rank of oxygen upgrades.But to answer the famous “planet boundaries” question, no, it’s not a big deal, given that you have to walk 40 minutes in one direction to hit it, something you will never, ever need or want to do. I never hit an invisible wall in my entire playtime, and chances are you won’t either. Want to go somewhere else on a planet? Get in your ship and fly to a different biome. Diverse planets may have deserts, forests, mountains and polar caps all in one package. Even the empty, barren moons may have some good mercenary hideouts to farm, or you’ll find ships landing nearby spoiling for a fight.One issue here is that there’s also a whole lot of loading. For me and my SSD that was okay, but even I noticed it. The worst offender is Neon, the game’s floating cyberpunk city, but while actual Cyberpunk 2077 is a giant, seamless experience, Neon is broken up into very small chunks you have to constantly load between a zillion times, then within those, even more loading for each individual shop or hideout. It’s a lot.StarfieldAnd ah, you want to know about bugs! Of course you do, it’s a Bethesda game, right? Well, the fact that I forgot to write about them until now should tell you something. Sure, there are bugs, but nearly all of them are your typical “NPCs doing goofy shit” type stuff, clipping through ceilings or tables. Visually stuttering when you try to talk to them in conversation. My favorite was when there was a guard I was supposed to bribe in Neon, but every time I reached him, he would just float up into the air so I couldn’t reach him. I fixed that by just shooting him before he floated too high, and I took his keycard.There were a couple more serious bugs that weren’t permanent but took a few tries to get past. One prevented me from firing my ship weapons in target lock mode until I restarted the whole game. That was bad, but it also only happened maybe three times total in my entire playthrough. Another time an entire civilian town turned hostile on me for no reason, which took a couple reloads to fix. As for performance, there are some significant stutters entering some of the more populated areas, but overall it’s mostly fine.The part of Starfield I’m most conflicted about is the ending. And of course, that is something I cannot really talk about here. The game is set up for New Game Plus, but the way it implements it really confused me at first, and it has taken a lot of time to understand what I think they’re trying to do with it. But it’s going to take possibly even hundreds more hours to really prove that one way or the other, and it will be a community-wide project. One thing I will say is that I would probably not do New Game Plus after you beat the main story right away. You’ll see why. Or if you do, make sure you have some backup saves if you change your mind like I did. You have the option to delay it indefinitely and come to the choice at any time.I really do love this game. Yes, Bethesda doesn’t match some of its peers in many places, but in part that’s because it’s trying to do everything, all at once. But if you wanted a giant Bethesda RPG set in space with better combat and a whole lot of time to level and build things and explore and find secrets, yeah, this is it. They did it.

VG247,"Starfield’s grandiose scope sets the scene for a few under-developed ideas in an otherwise thoughtful, muddy take on the sci-fi genre.Starfield is about humanity peeling back the mysteries of the universe to understand its place in the cosmos. Except when it’s about exploration. Or pirates. It has an anti-war message, sometimes, when it isn’t promoting the military. Sometimes there’s smuggling, but you can be a space cop, or a space cop who smuggles contraband and beats up debt defaulters. No one in Starfield really cares what you do most of the time, though some of your companions get a bit unhappy if you murder people.
I don’t really know what to make of Starfield. After roughly 90 hours and nearly two weeks, I have no idea what it wants me to think, do, or feel about any of its themes. Bethesda’s head of publishing, Pete Hines, said Starfield only really gets going after 130 hours.
There’s a lot going on, too much for Starfield to fully develop or explore (which is ironic, given the game’s core conceit). As a coherent set of ideas and goals, well, it just isn’t. But the fun to be had when Starfield isn’t bent on being infuriating is tangible. Compelling. Intricate. I even stumbled on some interesting and surprisingly thoughtful narrative themes, eventually. They're just tucked deep in the pockets of the galaxy, far beyond what's apparent to the naked eye in the beginning.You start life in Starfield as a miner who stumbles on a mysterious artifact and has an even more mysterious reaction after touching it. Pirates invade; a man named Barrett theoretically swoops in to save the day (though you do all the fighting); and you end up with his ship and an invitation to Constellation – a storied band of explorers dedicated to surveying the galaxy.As a Bethesda opening, it isn’t very good. The first step-out moment is rushed and uninspiring, and there’s nothing to anchor you in Starfield’s world, anyone in it, or even yourself. Your character is easily the studio’s least interesting protagonist, though that’s due in part to a lack of personality in most of your dialogue choices for roughly three quarters of the game.So off you go to New Atlantis, the oldest colony in the settled systems, a city with big theme park vibes and about six or eight character models that get reused ad nauseum for the nameless, unimportant people milling about. The other big cities are much the same – settlements themed around a few on-the-nose cultural elements, what you’d get if Disney made Epcot. In space.Your next stop is Constellation headquarters, a cozy lodge that’s part-Victorian social club and part-high tech research lab. The Constellation missions move the plot along, your main story quests, comprised of MacGuffin hunts that ferry you around star systems and teach you the basics. You can (and should) also take on faction missions that plunge you into the Settled Systems’ murky politics, where the galaxies really come to life, and you meet a fascinating cast of characters.A lot of the people you meet are broken and lonely, rootless, metaphorically floating in space with no direction. If not that, they’re working under exploitative conditions – or they’re the ones doing the exploiting. It’s a setup rife for exploration and some profound insights, but Starfield never quite asks why people are like this. It rarely investigates the human condition further. That lack of willingness to explore its own themes throughout the game is at odds with how rapt you can be in the intricacies of its world, of its systems. Starfield leaves you to do the exploring, thematically as well as mechanically, and how appealing that is will depend on the player. When it works, it works wonders.Starfield takes American ideas and social systems and spreads them across the galaxies, which, okay, I have to admit that’s probably what us Americans would try to do if we lived in space. But the point is that it just doesn’t make sense for that to be all there is. All citizens of Earth left the planet and spread throughout star systems, so we should see more evidence of multiple cultures, societal problems and opportunities, and ways of thinking.
Instead, the overarching issues are essentially the same debates that occupied high-level American political thinking since the end of World War II – namely, the role of government. Starfield wants to make a statement about Big Government and bureaucracy in the United Colonies (and also problems with Big Military, though Starfield doesn’t like to bring that up too often). Then the Freestar Collective illustrates the potential hazards of the opposite, of loose, decentralized federations with little oversight. A tension exists between the statements the game tries to make, and though the minutiae is finely-detailed and well-textured, the overall package is toothless and inert.One of my least favorite sets of quests was on Mars, where the only difference you can make for the oppressed miners there is helping them find ways to work harder, and more often, without changing the structures that exploit them. Extrapolate from that what you will.
Religion plays a significant role in Starfield, but the only religious and philosophical strains of thinking are rooted deeply in American and Western European traditions. Except the people who worship the giant snake god, branded as “foreigners”, who dedicate themselves to a holy war on behalf of their true god, because of course they do.
The limited scope for other ideas, other possible ways of living and thinking, holds Starfield back from being as deep as it probably wants to be. But, within those limitations, there are several deeper moments that stand out thanks to their attention to detail and thoughtfulness. And they make all the difference.
The Sanctum Universum is one of my favorites. The Sanctum is Generic Space Monotheism, but there’s a fair bit of nuance in how Bethesda created it. The priest on New Atlantis’ name is Father Aquilas (likely a reference to the medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas mixed with a nod to Aquila from the Christian New Testament). The Aquinas vibes intensify if you read the church’s doctrine, which Father Aquilas wrote, where he combines strains of Plato’s philosophy with science and some forward-thinking monotheistic ideas about finding a god in space, blending several traditions into something new. Thomas Aquinas was famous for being one of the first medieval thinkers to do the same for Christian philosophy.
It’s a nice, even impressive, touch. And it’s when you see these delicate, artisinal flourishes in the galaxy that Starfield shows what it is truly capable of. Another example is a companion who arrived at a form of Deism – the belief that a higher power exists, but doesn’t meddle in human affairs – by reading Renaissance and Enlightenment-era philosophy. Those same writings inspired the first Deists in Western Europe, and there’s a welcome element of realism in having people recycle old ideas to come up with something sort of new-ish – that’s just what we do, and Starfield is at its most honest, and most appealing, when it realises these ideas wholesale.“But… what about everything else?” you’re probably asking. I asked myself the same question after about 30 hours of traveling around, talking to people, and doing various odd jobs around the star systems, so I decided to find out. The answer is that it depends on what you’re doing and how invested you are in the idea of it. Starfield falls over itself to give you everything and let you be anything – though it rarely stops to consider whether any of it is worth doing or being. In place of character stats and proficiencies, you get several basic skill trees, improving things like pistol firepower or your stamina. These are deceptively shallow, and the more points you pump into the many, many available skills, the more fine-tuned your character will be. None are essential, but they're all useful; isn't that a reflection on what it's like being alive now, a worker in today's gig economy?You can mod your weapons – think Call of Duty gunsmith, not Cyberpunk sci-fi pipe dream. Mods, and other upgrades, require materials, and materials mean trips into the wilds of space to gather vegetables, animals, or minerals. You get as much out of these systems as you put in; it feels like they're here for role-playing, not essential to the gameplay loop. At least you get incremental amounts of XP for literally everything you do; even the most uninspiring trip into another barren planet yields something, at least.
The space experience takes place mostly in an instanced space just outside a planet’s atmosphere, and it's bland. Nearby planets and stations are too far away for you to reach via normal travel, and getting around requires navigating several menus and loading screens – enter the ship, leave your location, travel to another, dock, landing, and leave your ship. At least it loads quickly.But when you're in your ship, you get to dogfight. Starfield is so very nearly a deep ship-captain simulator, but a lot of the piloting systems are pretty illusions. Every dogfight has a kernel of excitement, though, even if you can see behind the curtain as you toggle systems on and off for the 14th time. 
Starfield’s outpost-building trumps its ship management, and dovetails nicely with exploration. You can (and should) build outposts on planets to help with supply lines and resource management. It sounds sterile, but a generous selection of furnishings enables you to turn functional buildings into oases of style and comfort in the middle of the empty sea of stars.
Outposts are also a handy excuse to pick up new crew members to keep them running. These members vary between procedurally generated stock crew (such as a random gunner or navigator) to complex characters with deep and interesting backgrounds – some of whom ended up being my favorite characters in the game, despite them playing a comparatively small role. When Bethesda deigns to look at the dirt under its characters' nails like this, the developer is best in class. It's just in space, that's so few and far between.
Building outposts also costs money and materials, which pushes you to seek out more quests and hunt down some of Starfield’s hundreds of lifeless resource-rich planets. The loop is well-greased, and propels you on, eternally. Despite how beautiful many of Starfield’s planets are, most of them – even the ones with life – have just a scant handful of “points of interest”; caves, landing pads, random geological formations. It’s possible that I just missed a trigger to make something happen at a few of these. Overheard conversations and being in the right place at the right time often causes something new and unexpected to happen. Who knows? Maybe if I stood in a ditch on a planet in the Narion system at sunset, something worthwhile might have happened at that empty industrial outpost on Titan. But with a game this size, that level of specificity risks being whispered into the ether, the consequences lost in the vastness of space.
There are a lot of very good quests in Starfield, even outside the faction missions. This is where Bethesda’s “everything and the kitchen sink” approach works well. One mission has you tracking down hackers who tapped the cash resources in New Atlantis’ premier bank. Another borrows from horror games and sees you fleeing a terrifying monster as you try to find a way of defeating it, and a few minutes later, you might find yourself exposing political corruption at the highest level.Some of these are just your basic fetch quests, but the context around what you’re doing elevates them and keeps things interesting. The downside is that most of the satisfaction is limited to how invested you are in that quest, since even some of the best missions have little lasting effect on the world around you. Maybe that’s a comment on real life, though.
Starfield is not greater than the sum of its parts. If you add all its misshapen, under-developed pieces together, you get kind of a ramshackle kitbash, with a few extra bits left over. Some of those pieces are cleverly crafted and engaging, representing a developer at the peak of its power, though they often get lost in Starfield’s sprawling scope. What remains is often enjoyable, but often frustrating. There’s no denying this cosmic behemoth is special, but with a more focused vision, and some extra narrative daring, Starfield could’ve been something truly incredible.

God is a Geek,"September 6, 2023It’s tough knowing where to start, but as big as it is, Starfield is at its best in the little moments where you pull at a thread and reveal a large tapestry of wonder. Spending time with Starfield’s character creator gives you an idea about some of the lore along with what you can expect to be doing in your hundreds of hours with it. You’ll pick traits and a background that’ll help you shape the person you’ll be. Do you crave to catalogue and understand all walks of life, learning about the uncharted biomes and creatures that hide in the furthest reaches of space? Do you wish to scour the galaxy and hunt down the various scum and villainy, or crave to join those criminals and become rich beyond your wildest dreams?Starfield starts off slowly, as you find an artefact that holds greater meaning. In doing so, you join a group of explorers called Constellation, and throughout the main campaign you’ll find more of these mysterious objects and realise you’re not the only ones who are looking for them. It’s a standard story made infinitely better by the cast of characters you’ll meet. It wasn’t until I was around 20 hours in that I realised how much of a hold these characters had on me. After a huge decision I had to make, I felt the repercussions on a deeply emotional level. I won’t say I regret what I did, but when lives are at stake, the burden still weighs heavy on my heart.Endless possibilities await outside the main story, but it isn’t until you’re out there in the claustrophobic caves, dense spacestations, ramshackle settlements, or bustling cities that you realise just how grand Starfield is. Sure, you can travel to endless planets and visit moons to run around on and explore, but that’s where it’s less appealing. It is in the moments you create on your own, when Bethesda gives you a canvas for you to paint your own picture upon. Some of my favourites revolved around supplying drugs to a lowly criminal in order to help a popular DJ; a deal gone wrong making an entire ship filled of guards attack me and my companion, and a conspiracy involving a council member..You can find quests and activities everywhere: whether overhearing a conversation, chatting with a stranger, or even looting a corpse and finding a note. These all vary in length, however, some can lead to impressive rewards and bags of credits. Faction missions have to be some of my favourite, where you can join everyone from the criminal organisation known as the Crimson Fleet to law-abiding rangers known as the Freestar Collective. There’s just always something for you to get stuck into, making the most of your skills as a gunslinger or negotiator, tough guy or pacifist, or whatever kind of player you are.Some have multiple outcomes depending on your ability in certain situations, and by completing quests, exploring planets, and discovering lifeforms, you’ll earn XP to learn or upgrade new skills. These come under five distinct categories: Physical, Social, Combat, Science, and Tech. Some of them unlock new abilities like using a jet pack or engaging thrusters on your ship, while others improve you persuasion and intimidation during conversations, proficiency with different weapons, and the effectiveness of med packs and other aid. There are 82 in total, giving you a ton of choice, and they can all be ranked up to make them even more effective.It’s a lot to take in at first, especially because of how much there is to do. Getting familiar to space travel and how to set a course to specific planets; controlling your ship and knowing how to dock on a nearby ship or station, fire your canons and missiles, and activate your grav drive; managing your inventory and weight; swapping out frantically between weapons and how to equip them during a fight; learning what all the stats mean across spacesuits, helmets, and packs; applying aid for burns, contusions, freezing, or replenishing health; and once you’ve grasped the basics, it’s time to understand the complexities of outpost and ship building.There isn’t a ton of explanation as you play, although there is a helpful guide within the menus that breaks down everything you can and can’t do, and how to do it, but I don’t recall being actually told it exists. Bethesda wants you to find things out for yourself and I get that, but with so many systems to familiarise yourself with, some in-game guidance would have been appreciated. By spending time looting and fighting, flying, and exploring, everything starts to become clear organically. You’ll find your path and live out your dreams; it just takes a little time. When it does click, you can relax and appreciate how incredible the world of Starfield is.I’ve had so much fun exploring the intricacies of certain cities, all with their own politics and hierarchies. It’s the characters and how I communicate with them, listening to their stories and understanding relationships while making my own when I’ve enjoyed Starfield the most. That’s not so say I haven’t had a blast buying new ships and assigning my crew, engaging in dogfights with huge warships in space, or delving into the deep crafting systems there are. Some things I’ve spent very little doing, such as outpost building, but that doesn’t mean I can’t, or won’t at some point.There’s something for every type of player. Those who enjoy FPS shooters or the RPG fanatics among you. Those that spend hours building bases to the finest details, or those just wanting to enjoy a fun story with great acting. Bethesda has nailed the smallest detail and has filled Starfield with secrets and opportunities in every place possible. It’s ambitious and engaging, filled with countless mechanics that can be explored as deeply as you want. You can play Starfield however you want, and it’s incredible just how free you are to live among the stars.Perhaps the greatest achievement for me is how rare Starfield has bugged out or glitched on me. For a game so large, I’ve only had a handful of weird NPC movements or bugs, and none of them have impacted anything I’ve done on a gameplay level. There are so many load screens which appear whenever you enter or leave a shop or building, or travelling from planet to planet, but the way your photos taken in photo mode appear make the waiting more bearable. They aren’t long waiting times to be fair, but there is quite a lot of them.For a game as big as Starfield, these issues are a drop in the ocean. I’ve not had this much fun with a game since last year’s Elden Ring, and that sense of discovery I felt playing FromSoft’s epic fantasy has returned. I’ll be playing Starfield for a long time, and I can’t wait to discuss with friends some of the discoveries and memories they’ve made. It’s a beautiful looking game that surpasses what has come from studio before, leading the company in a positive direction for the future. There’s no end to the kind of person you can become, and if you’re still on the fence about it, hop off and download this to your Xbox right now.Complete freedom to be who you want
