Eurogamer,"Bigger and Baldur.
Despite the ostensibly modern tone, God of War's Norse revival has always seemed retro by nature. That 2018 mega-hit, and indeed God of War: Ragnarök, its hugely anticipated follow-up, are Metroidvanias at heart, games that have you explore a world of mazing, criss-crossing tunnels and interlocking paths, that tease you past closed doors waiting to be opened on some later, more empowered return, or through secret ones you never knew existed. 

These worlds live in service to two of video games' most distinctly video-gamey moments: the ""Aha! At last,"" of finally smashing that purple obstacle with your new purple spell, and the ""Huh! Didn't expect to wind up here"" of emerging into sunlight through the exit of some dark, hidden passageway, pockets clinking with the sound of plundered gold. The result is a curious tension. Of all the recent blockbusters awarded the dubious title of ""cinematic experience,"" God of War was the one that still carried the untamed heart of a video game.

It might seem a tiny bit facile, but that tension really was the crux of 2018's game: just as Kratos attempted to move on from a past he looked upon with shame, the series attempted to leave its excessive, often puerile tendencies behind, replacing quick-time-event sex scenes and cartoonish style with a solemn, intimate father-son tale. There's an argument, however, that God of War maybe over-compensated just a tad, its self-seriousness occasionally turning to a naval-gazing self-regard. But still it couldn't help itself: Godly skulls were pummelled, wolfman jaws were ripped off, somewhere in there, buried and denied, the old Kratos never really went away. 

In Ragnarök that tension continues. If anything its dialled up, in the way that many sequels often are, each of the disparate parts - the size of the world, the length of the story, the number of characters and skill trees, crafting screens, and pixels on the TV - growing exponentially, the emphasis on providing more of what people loved, rather than the balance of how it all knits together. But, crucially, this is a tension Ragnarök aims to resolve. And it does. After taking an awful lot of time to think about it, this game, like its protagonists, realises what it truly is, and finally learns to love itself for it. The result is big and silly - and deliriously satisfying.

God of War: Ragnarök picks up three years after the events of God of War, with Kratos and his son Atreus - never ""Boy"" in Ragnarök - hiding out in their humble cabin. Atreus is ""coming into some powers,"" as teenage gods do, and coming into a bit of an attitude problem as well, not helped by the obscured prophecy found at the end of God of War. The events of the previous game have had consequences, too: Freya, Queen of the imposing Valkyries and mother to the slain villain-god Baldur, has turned from ally to nemesis, desperate for revenge. 

Parental wrath is, unsurprisingly, a running theme here. Magni and Modi, two more insufferable Norse gods, or Aesir, were also killed by us in the first game and have a rueful father in Thor, wonderfully imagined as a towering, belligerent strongman - eventually he proves a mirror for Kratos, a what-if outcome, were he to let his self-loathing run free. Most important of all is Baldur's father and 'All Father' of the nine realms, Odin, a master of knowledge and spies rendered here as a kind of magnanimous mob boss, cloak draped over his shoulders like both the closed wings of his ravens and the overcoat of Don Fanucci.

The Aesir take more prominence in God of War: Ragnarök than you might initially expect, and they're an odd bunch, as the characters of Norse mythology are in general. Their inter-family feuds play out with mixed success - Freya takes surprising, but well-earned prominence in a few ways, and her quest for retribution feels powerful. Others feel like crossovers from the Twilight Saga, all pallid and pompous and unnervingly West Coast. Ragnarök, as a concluding entry to this only two game long saga, clearly feels a pressure to include as much of the canon as possible, a completionist streak that can leave it feeling both bloated and crowded as a result. It can't help but keep throwing more characters at you, more references to backstory lore or minor incidents from the previous game, to the extent that I half expected the log you carry during the first tutorial to turn up and deliver a soliloquy. 

This bloat is without doubt the biggest problem for Ragnarök. With more efficiency its story could be told in half the time, with half the characters, and in its tropey, misunderstanding-fuelled middle hours it sags under the weight of it all, falling into the mopier tendencies of the previous game but without the tight, double-act focus that kept it moving. There are a huge amount of cutscenes, which flow beautifully in and out of the player-controlled action with more sophistication than ever - God of War isn't the only game to use a one-shot take for its camerawork, but I still marvel at it, the amount of cross-team coordination that must take. 

But there are still too many of them, forgotten lovers and brothers and probably someone's cousin's pet dog getting lengthy screen time each - likely, I suspect, because of an urge to ""do justice"" to each minor character's arc, to prevent them from feeling used by the story. If that's the reason, it's slightly misguided thinking - there are more tools in the best writers' arsenals than lengthy conversation for making characters feel alive. A single, well-formed expression can deliver as much depth and nuance as half an hour with some of Ragnarök's chats.

In these moments the story's problems seep into its gameplay, each puzzle feeling more and more like it exists purely to stall for time so yet more quippy Marvel banter can be used to retreat the same exhausted, overstretched themes once more - trust! Self-doubt! Fate and prophecy! This is part of the natural tension with games like God of War: Ragnarök. For a game designed around play sessions that last for one self-contained hour, it makes complete sense to rehash conversations in order to embed you back into a story you might've spent a week away from. In longer chunks though, it struggles - a victim of the intense way these games are reviewed, sure but plenty will blast through sections over a weekend, by the end of which you might marvel at the amount of words shared without an inkling of progress.

Chatter is also a key problem for that puzzling, too, which makes up at least a solid half of what you'll be doing in God of War: Ragnarök. I love God of War's puzzles. They're simple and mechanistic but tuned in such a way as to just tickle the exact right part of your brain, the lizardy bit that likes tightening screws on wobbly chairs and lining notebooks up with the edge of your desk. This goes here, put that on that, turn this and, tada! Open sesame. I never tire of it, and there are more than ever in Ragnarök. 

But Ragnarök does try its best to undermine my enjoyment at times, thanks to a truly overbearing urge to offer you hints. You will not look at a puzzle for more than a few seconds before one companion or another (there are many, all as overeager as the next) tells you the solution. ""Maybe that lever could help, brother!"" Yeah? The lever I'm pulling right now? You don't say, Mimir! The joy of these puzzles is that they are actually incredibly simple but they make you feel like they're complicated because of the visuals, the sense of whirring mechanism, all the satisfaction coming from how you feel smart for solving them, watching the micro-chain of cause and effect start to flow like you're the master of your little universe. Patronising you with a solution before you can even nock the required magic arrow - and a dog-training ""Well done!"" after the fact, for good measure - often spoils the fun.

Crucially, though, there is an awful lot of fun. The flipside to having an overlong story is that it means there is simply more of this game, something the majority will want - as I did, to my surprise, even after finally reaching its end - and will gladly pay the price of a few more skippable cutscenes to enjoy. The world of God of War: Ragnarök is vast and really quite strange - I spent a large part of my time with it reaching for the right analogy to describe it, but really, Ragnarök is a theme park. 

In fact, it's a lot like a theme park - the more you sit with that thought the more it all lines up. Along your journey you will ride rollercoasters through mountains, log flumes through mines, take oh-so-many guided boat tours through new regions - Elf land! Dwarf land! The one where you'll get to pet wild animals! You'll meet your favourite heroes. You'll wonder how Brok and Sindri, the walking mascots of this universe, will manage to appear simultaneously in one realm and some other, but never two at once. Do they have some secret network of mascot tunnels? Multiple actors in the same costumes? Each side mission functions as an attraction, often a literal island with a tightly contained ten minutes of fun. The closer you look the more irrefutable it becomes, from the way the game's extras move like animatronic puppets behind picket fences and tavern bars, right down to the invisible walls along its many linear paths, that all seem to guide you, through the mystic art of psychological engineering - the spacing of paving slabs, the use of light - from one attraction to the next. By the end it's clear: this is a complete Disney World of Adventure through the nine Norse realms.

I mean this as a compliment. One of Ragnarök's real achievements is in how it has progressed beyond a reliance on mere visual fidelity to provide its spectacle. It's mined Norse myths for their weirdness, their idiosyncrasies that set them apart and give this modern series its oddly gaudy, outsized charm. It has fun with size, in fact, having you duck beneath dwarven rafters one moment and scarper about amongst giant bric-a-brac the next. Its realms are more varied, less oppressive and so more inviting for your eventual return, and gloriously colourful but importantly, playful with that colour. Big, platform tentpole blockbusters, much like the recent output from Marvel, their cousins in entertainment, often equate vivid colour (usually purple) with cohesive visual creativity, but Ragnarök makes some effort in places to play with texture and tone, if still not really going for it with form. 

Combat, similarly, retains much of its structural rigidness, which in this case is a slight shame. I would've loved a more systemic approach to its elements, of which there are a few now - I can imagine a world where this game lets you manipulate enemies in more interesting ways, throwing them into one another after a grab with the Blades of Chaos for instance, rather than the usual pull-you-to-me, or me-to-you whiplash. There is a bit of synergy across skills that do more damage when using your frosty Leviathan axe on an enemy you've set ablaze, for instance, but there's very little room for expression. 

Fights in this game are designed to be structured cinema, where you can chain a few high-cooldown abilities with sumptuous, choreographed fluidity (a quick word on how animations can cancel from an attack into an execution, for instance, without you breaking flow for even a moment: stunning work). This style will make for some marvellous GIFs and glittering social media compilations, and the sense of impact - the attention to each flick of the wrist, click of the fingers, glint of metal, clang of armour, scream of rage, even the timing of combat frames and the basics of keeping battlefields plain so the combat itself and burst with visual noise - is just unparalleled. But the satisfaction that this is all for is immediate, which is the best and worst part of it all: at any moment you can hold L1 and press R2 to feel like a god, but the deeper sense of achievement in games will always come from overcoming the odds in the face of your mortality.

Much of the last God of War's shortcomings - and there were a few - have been thoroughly mended here, though. Enemy variety was a justified complaint, and clearly heard loud and clear at Santa Monica Studio (one previously ever-present enemy type is even acknowledged with some nicely self-deprecating humour). There's no risk of repetition in Ragnarök. There are far more designs, but variety comes with more depth than that too. You'll need to use a far wider range of abilities to get by - shield bashes, companion abilities, weapons - and adapt to attacks of different speed, height, and direction. Occasionally the over-the-shoulder camera is a little tight, and despite a button for quickly switching to behind you this can still be a bit of a hindrance. 

But still, the variety of it all - bosses in particular, is a real boon, a vast improvement from 2018. Within minutes you'll have fought what feels like more sub-bosses than the entirety of the previous game could offer. Many of these are quite typical - prepare to aim for glowing weak spots and turn attacks against their owners - but there are so many different ones it never feels rote. 

They also improve dramatically as time goes by. God of War has a fight on its hands with boss encounters, thanks to a couple of superlative battles in fellow first-party exclusive Returnal. Next to the bullet hell, score attack retro vibes that game could call upon to summon flowstate zen through pounding techno and screen-filling particles it would always be a struggle, especially as there, tension came from circumstance - the sheer desperation to avoid yet another lengthy run to the boss. Here, tension is conjured through force of will, a typically desperate, occasionally overblown but never less than epic score from Bear McCreary, the pounding battle drum of Ragnarök's dialogue, those repetitive lines chanted like a prayer before war. 

Above all, though, Ragnarök's dramatic might comes from its unique access to a sense of scale, a sense that was so sorely missed in the previous game and remedied with conviction here at last. You will fight some big, ugly monsters in God of War: Ragnarök, you will climb on their backs, lash at them with your blades, bellow defiance up to them from below. You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage. It takes a long time to get there, but this is a series that's needed to do a little soul-searching, to work through its own awkward teenage phase and wince at its old regrets. Its own heroes prove to be just the tonic.

What if it was [whisper it] just… okay? I loved the last game but it set a pretty high bar, one which Ragnarok just about brushes with outstretched fingertips. It's not quite as good as the last game, but it's damn close, and a God of War running at 90% is still better than most things out there.Release date: November 9, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4
Developer: Sony Santa Monica
Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentTo be clear: God of War Ragnarok is a great game, with eventually weighty emotional moments, incredibly satisfying puzzles, and combat that's never less than enjoyable. The only thing letting it down is that developer Sony Santa Monica doesn't really know what to do with the first half of the experience. After an incredibly emotional opening (be warned, there will be tears) the wheels sort of spin for a while with no clear direction. There's always something to do, or an objective to chase, but some sort of spark is missing and the momentum that finally picks up and barrels you through the ending takes a while to get going.  The 2018 game crackled with energy as Kratos and Atreus struggled with grief and each other – the growing pains of both Kratos' fatherly responsibilities and Atreus' burgeoning adulthood could make almost any moment an emotional experience or friction filled clash of wills. ""There are consequences…"" Kratos famously states in the previous game during a key event, and here that doesn't feel the case for while. The pair operate as a functional team (more or less) and while Ragnarok is coming, little seems to change at first, leaving the literal apocalypse to feel more like a McGuffin to move characters around the plot. As a result, the opening hours struggle to find any sense of weight.God of War Ragnarok is still great to play at this point, but for the first 15 hours or so it feels like it's treading water; stretched out and playing for time. Almost everything you do in this period has basically a minimal net gain. At best, you'll earn a small plot advancement that doesn't quite feel like adequate pay off for the time it took. After I spent half an hour collecting fruit I had no idea how the story was going to get to Ragnarok itself, and I was starting to worry that it didn't either.However, once certain elements fall into place you can feel everything palpably kick up a notch, and the stakes aren't so much raised as thrown into the air. Past a critical point it's like having the 2018 game back – lines and events will make you gasp out loud, there are lump in the throat moments, probably some more tears, and scenes that burn themselves into your memory. Where the opening half is mostly amiable chit chat about maybe checking out the next objective, the closing feels like you're being repeatedly punched in the gut and the heart alternately until it's all over. Kratos continues to be one of the most interesting character reformations in video games, and by the time the credits rolled I was happy for him in a way I wasn't expecting. He suffers most from the slow start, feeling barely present at times, but both he and Atreus ultimately go on a journey in every sense of the word. And, of the two, it's him that travels furthest. I obviously won't spoil anything, but by the end I didn't know if I wanted to do a private little air-punching 'yes!' or just rush up and hug that big beard. Nearly every character benefits when things take off and the script gets more meat to it. I never expected Sindri to be a firm favorite, for example. Thor is a flawed man and a layered villain in the mold of Balder. While Odin exudes an amiable, quietly spoken threat that leaks danger, usually more the nicer he gets. I'm not quite sure how well God of War Ragnarok handles certain elements of the plot that relate to abuse, addiction, and mental health, but I'll leave that to people with far more experience and wisdom than me to break down. In terms of overall progression and gameplay, God of War Ragnarok feels a little more focused than its predecessor, often with more linear and direct paths to main objectives that reward you with an open area of side quests to explore once a crucial objective has been ticked off. There's also more in the way of puzzles – just about every door needs something spun, burned, or whacked in some way. They're just the right level of challenge to always feel satisfying, although it feels like the early stages are either playing for time or not big enough to properly space the puzzles out. At the start you can barely take a step without having to trigger a mechanism somewhere.As the story picks up and becomes more meaningful, there's a little less busy work and the open areas you unlock expand in scope. They're all fairly self-contained but stack up, crisscrossing the realms, to create a pleasing raft of side missions to snack on – ghosts that need help, Nornir chests to open, fights and monsters to beat, and more. Earlier areas can be cleared quite quickly, and you'll rarely ever find a side quest that takes more than a few minutes, but by the time you're finished the story there's a generous helping of stuff to keep it going. One area in particular has a real endgame vibe as well, with a level of complexity and layering far exceeding the rest, which will take some time to unravel. I finished the story somewhere around the 35 hour mark, with a fair amount of wandering and side stuff under my belt and now, around 45-50 hours in, I'm still exploring and finding new stuff.There's obviously a lot of fighting as you explore all this, and the combat continues to feel heavy and impactful, even as Ragnarok introduces more simplified systems. The core of combat is still balancing the focused icy damage of Kratos' Leviathan Axe to wail on single enemies, while the fiery hell of his Blades of Chaos burn everything around you. The enchantment system, which let you add buffs to gear in the previous game, has now been moved to a single amulet that can take nine enchantments. Each one buffs different stats like health, damage, and so on, but come as part of a trio – matching two or three of the set then powers up a different perk. It's much easier to manage a build in Ragnarok, particularly as different armor sets are more clearly focused on damage, cooldowns, Runic (magic) and other key stats.  I found God of War Ragnarok an oddly split experience overall. There's a light start that feels padded – still good but missing depth – which leads into a weighty finish that's every bit the equal of its predecessor. But despite feeling like a 15 hour story trying to fill a 30 hour game, God of War Ragnarok is still easily one of the best PS5 games. Even when it feels a bit thin, that's largely in comparison to the last game, with this maintaining that same absurd level of polish, and entertainment, even when the story feels like it's filling for time. When the dial does finally crank up to 11 you can feel it kick in, and by the end there are some incredible beats and a hugely satisfying resolution overall. God of War Ragnarok was reviewed on PS5, with a code provided by the publisher.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"The biggest PS4 and PS5 exclusive of the year is finally here but can Ragnarök live up to the spectacle of the previous God Of War?The 2018 God Of War deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest franchise reinventions of all time. Despite the subtitle-less name it was not a reboot, but instead a direct continuation of the story of Kratos – a god of war from Ancient Greece who up until that point had been one of gaming’s most loathsomely amoral protagonists. The games are almost unplayable nowadays, for anyone that’s not a terminally moody teenager, and yet they had to have existed in order for the new game to happen, and for Kratos to embark on one of the greatest redemptive journeys that gaming has ever seen.If God Of War had been some low budget indie game its themes would not have seemed so surprising, but it was a massive budget AAA PlayStation exclusive and Sony deserve just as much credit for publishing it as Santa Monica Studio do for making it. By the end of the game Kratos was transformed, from a heartless monster into not only a loving father but someone that wanted to seek out and help other people.You might think that leaves nowhere for the sequel, on both PlayStation 5 and 4, to go but while, at the start of this new game, Kratos has become overly protective of his son he’s still a good person (well, god) and becomes even better through the course of this new journey. The character-based storytelling is exceptional on any level, but most especially for such a violent, previously nihilistic, action game franchise.Although the above is all true, judging the game as a whole it’s clear it’s not quite so perfectly formed as its predecessor. The primary problem, oddly, is the plot, which is so vaguely sketched that at times it seems almost non-existent. At the beginning of the game Kratos and his son Atreus – who has learnt his Nordic name is Loki – are merely trying to stay out of everyone’s way, since their actions in the previous game caused the start of Ragnarök, an end of the world myth that seems to be everywhere in pop culture at the moment.Not only have the duo upset Odin’s ex-wife Freya, by preventing her son from murdering her, but they’ve also attracted the attention of Odin and Thor – although at the beginning of the game there’s a half-hearted attempt at a truce, which is actually a ruse for Odin to try and convince Atreus to fulfil a prophecy where he willingly joins him.The game spends an awful lot of time meditating on the concept of unavoidable fate, which is fine in the context of Nordic beliefs at the time but is hardly a subject that needs much arguing against in the modern day. It does, however, bring to mind the themes of Terminator 2 and we suspect that film has been a great influence here, given it’s also a violent action experience with an anti-war message.It’s debatable how clearly that concept, and the one about the perils of seeking vengeance, is put across by the conclusion of the story, but the biggest problem with the plot is how formless it is. Odin is not a very proactive adversary and Kratos and his allies spend an awful lot of time talking about how they don’t know what to do or where to go, which becomes increasingly demoralising when you’re already feeling that way as a player. This ends up making everything seem very directionless, with the plot’s goals all being very vague until almost the last moment.It’s a good job, then, that all the action is still as much fun as ever. God Of War is a third person action game not dissimilar to other big name Sony franchises, but with much more involved combat and only a semi-open world structure.Kratos still has his axe from the last game, but it can now generate ice powers, which are more effective against certain enemies. From the start of the game, he can also use his Blades of Chaos, from the original trilogy, which generate fire. A third weapon, with more vaguely defined wind powers, is introduced much later, but worrying about the elemental effects is rarely necessary and the pause while Kratos switches weapons means you can’t mix up combos Bayonetta or Devil May Cry style.The combat does have more depth to it than before, and there are separate skill trees to unlock for each of the weapons but, much like the story, they’re utilised in the most imprudent way possible. Whenever you upgrade a weapon, to unlock a new level in the skill tree, you usually have enough experience points to instantly buy them all at once. Even with the first set of abilities, you unlock so many at once it’s overwhelming.This is a terrible idea because some of the moves and abilities involve very specific control commands (which is good) but because they take time to learn, and you’re suddenly bombarded with half a dozen at once, it’s very easy to completely forget about them. The game isn’t especially easy but on normal difficulty we were often aware we were only ever using a small subset of the available moves, with the game providing no incentive or reminder to do anything else.These issues were present in the original but are exacerbated here because of the multiple weapons. However, Ragnarök does improve on the role-playing elements from the last game, which previously felt like mere inventory busywork. There are still too many special amulets, runes, and other buff-providing items but they’re easier to manage this time round and if nothing else there’s an auto-equip button.The puzzles have got very stale though, and while a few are quite clever none are very interesting, with far too many involving freezing gears to keep doors open or working out a way to move a crane so you can swing across a gap. These account for what must be 75% of the game’s puzzles and when you get a bunch of them in a row, which happens more than once, it begins to feel disappointingly uninspired. Although it’s even more irritating that whoever your companion is will blurt out the solution just seconds after you start trying to work it out.Ragnarök’s other problem is that the majority of realms you visit are places you’ve been before. The nine realms are a big part of Nordic mythology but most of them were already featured in the first game, so there are a lot of return visits. They’re mostly new areas, and there’s always an attempt to add something new – such as the puzzles involving bouncing your axe off special gems in the elf realm of Alfheim – but that can’t prevent the feeling of déjà vu.You spend a lot of time in Vanaheim and Svartalfheim, which weren’t featured in the original, but the former is a fairly stock example of a forest world and while the latter is the home of the dwarves the place still manages to look completely deserted even when you’re in the capital city.Although there is a variety of different companions, including some substantial playtime as Atreus (who plays surprisingly similarly to Kratos, despite his bow), in terms of the world you’re exploring everything feels so empty and lifeless. That was also the case in the previous game and we’re still not sure what the explanation is meant to be within the game’s lore.What’s especially frustrating about the locations is that they all follow the same formula and structure, with very little variation in terms of visuals or basic layout. There’s one noticeable exception that riffs on Jack and the Beanstalk style iconography, which is easily one of the most interesting sequences in the game, but it’s the only diversion like that.The graphics are overall very good, even if the facial animation is beginning to look a bit outdated, but the worlds you explore are disappointingly uninteractive and artificial. Whether you can or cannot climb or jump off a cliff often seem arbitrary, with the otherwise unstoppable Kratos often having his progress impeded by a small ledge.The use of invisible walls often means you can’t sidle round objects you could obviously fit between, all of which begins to recall the feeling of touring a theme park attraction. This impression is reinforced in Svartalfheim, in particular, which is full of fences with lots of dwarven mining equipment on the other side, which really does make it feel like you’re just walking through a Christmas grotto.Santa Monica Studio has already confirmed this will be the last entry to be based on Nordic myths and it’s easy to imagine there are multiple reasons for this, not least the fact that what was originally a startlingly innovative take on a moribund franchise is quickly starting to feel old hat. Many were upset that this is a cross-gen game and it’s clear everything has been designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 4, with no obvious use of the PlayStation 5’s power.Beyond that, there’s just a lot of very odd design decisions. This extends even to the voice-acting, which is very good on a technical level but has some bizarre choices in terms of accents – as well as noticeably more modern dialogue than last time, which often feels out of place. Almost every character is very obviously American, and this includes a dwarf that talks like a Southern belle stereotype and Odin’s actor who seems to be channelling Steve Buscemi in a Mafia role.The only accents that are even remotely Nordic are reserved for nameless, cannon fodder enemies. The one obvious exception is Mimir, voiced by Scottish actor Alastair Duncan, who we can only assume was being paid for how many times he could utter the word ‘brother’ in a single game. He’s far more annoying than he was in the original but, again, the game makes things worse by having all the other characters keep commenting on it.Despite the flaws, Ragnarök is still a very entertaining game. It’s longer than its predecessor and while, like the last the game, the combat and limited range of enemies does start to get old a little before the end there’s a mountain of post-game content that will still have you coming back for more.The end, which naturally we’re not going to spoil here, is a little disappointing though, not just because the final battles are slightly underwhelming but because there’s what many will see as a cop-out in terms of the story. Expectations are subverted at numerous points but the one at the end feels like the least interesting direction they could have taken things.Ragnarök’s greatest success is not the action, the exploration, and certainly not the plot. Instead, it’s the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, which is going to resonate strongly with everyone, but especially fathers and sons or those from a troubled family.Everything from the sacrifices necessary to become a parent to the awful inevitability of dealing with a parent whose time may be coming to an end are handled organically and in a very relatable manner – despite the fantastical nature of the characters. Questions of forgiveness, guilt, and dealing with loss are channelled through other characters as well, although there are enough inconsistences with Freya’s portrayal that she doesn’t seem quite so believable.The gradual thawing of Kratos’ personality, his struggle to communicate his love for his son, and Atreus’ attempts to both support his father and forge his own path are handled so masterfully well it seems all the stranger that the game could have made such obvious mistakes elsewhere.There’s even a successful attempt to humanise Thor and his kin, somewhat in the style of The Last Of Us Part 2, which again is impressively subtle in the way it depicts a fractured but still loving family.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationAction video games always struggle to tell meaningful stories about normal human emotions, for the simple fact that for the majority of any game you’re constantly killing people or things, but here it works. The context of everyone being a god or mythological being helps but mostly it’s just good writing, good performances, and the willingness to take time out from the action to show how the characters feel and how the events are affecting them – and all without any overlong cut scenes.Ragnarök gets some things wrong but the things it gets right almost no other action game ever has, and that at least is a godlike achievement.In Short: A more flawed experience than its predecessor, with a sense that the formula is already starting to wear thin, but the character-based storytelling with Kratos and his son is handled masterfully well.Pros: Excellent combat with plenty of depth, even if the game seems desperate to hide it from you. Huge game world, with mountains of content. Fantastic characterisation for the two leads.Cons: The plot is a formless jumble and most of the locations are overfamiliar and lacking in interactivity.

Game Informer,"To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the first time comes forward, along with a story that earns the proper definition of the term epic.
 
Ragnarök basically picks up exactly where the previous left off in terms of narrative. Atreus is a little older and has shed the ‘boy’ nickname entirely. In a tradition established early in the God of War series, the opening hours are stellar. The action kicks off immediately, setting up new foes and old friends, but among all the explosive set pieces are quiet moments of engrossing performance showcase. Newcomer Odin and returning scorned mother Freya’s characterizations are particularly fantastic, but even the weakest performance in Ragnarök makes the typical video game performance pale in comparison.The excellent moment-to-moment writing outdoes the already fantastic dialogue of the 2018 game. Ragnarök is, surprisingly, the funniest God of War to date. Kratos is the most stoic, straight man in all the nine realms and he surrounds himself with vulgar dwarves, a wisecracking decapitated head, a sometimes over-confident teenager, and more. I laughed often as Kratos said things like, “I do not need a snack,” when Sindri offered him food, or when he shared a dismissive grunt when characters made fun of him for only ever offering dismissive grunts. As key as the story has become to this new era of God of War, the combat remains an equally important element. The most negative thing to be said about fighting the various enemies of the nine realms is it isn’t radically different or changed from the previous game. You start with more weapons this time around, but the core combos are mostly the same. The library of special attacks you can pull off is larger, but I admit I found my favorites early on and was not particularly compelled to experiment.
 
The types of enemies you fight, on the other hand, has greatly expanded. Mini bosses are numerous, and when they repeat, a new wrinkle is typically added, or it is a fully optional pursuit. The optional content, which accounts for far more than additional boss fights, makes up a large percentage of an already massive game. Alongside side quests to pursue next to the main path, there are also large open areas to be explored at your leisure with sled dogs that offer worthwhile moments of character development and tangible rewards. In some cases, I completed side stories with big, important moments and only learned they had been optional afterward.Ragnarök, despite its fantastic setting, does feature a grounded tone thanks to its splendid performances and fully realized characters, but it is not afraid to be a fun video game. Puzzles expertly mix up the pace between combat encounters, and I was constantly impressed with how there always seemed to be story context for engaging in the video game parts. When ignoring the main task to find treasure chests, for example, Atreus would always take time to explain to the new characters that his dad likes loot. Despite the urgency of the story, Mimir would often make sure to state that we can take our time and explore if we want to. These little moments and bits of dialogue showcase Sony Santa Monica fully understands how its players want to interact with its game, and I was always thankful for that understanding.
 
Considering the player at every moment extends to the exceptional level design, as well. Whether visiting new versions of old locations or entirely new realms, each area wraps around itself to reveal shortcuts, or bypasses the need to backtrack. The well-designed combat arenas feature multiple levels to fight on and environmental attack options, like grabbing a giant rock to fling at that particularly pesky lizard. Even the way the player camera moves to hint at optional chests or tease new paths is impressive and consistent. The players’ direction is always considered.
 
God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn’t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn’t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnarök is no different.

   on November 3, 2022 at 9:00AM PDTGod of War Ragnarok is a lavish production with pristine visuals, jaw-dropping scale, crunchy combat that is as satisfying as it is brutal, and a world that begs to have its every corner and crevice explored. It's a spectacular blockbuster, but these are the least of its achievements.In a game where a hulking god rips all manner of creatures limb from limb, the most shocking moments aren't bathed in blood, but carried by poignant words and heartfelt emotions. They are a former God of War--known for mercilessly killing his kin--finding the words to empathize with loss; a despondent child emploring a father to break a self-destructive cycle; a moment of tenderness in the life of a boy that has the weight of the world on his shoulders.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: God of War Ragnarok ReviewGod of War Ragnarok's most impressive achievements are its exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; determinism and defiance. It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about families. Its story isn't about the end of the world, but those that have a hand in it. They're revered as mythical gods but are characterized by deep flaws, twisted by skewed perspectives, and corrupted by questionable motivations in the same way the people they preside over are. And yet, some also have redemptive qualities. In that respect, Ragnarok's story is told from a grey area where nuances blur the line between heroes and villains; good and evil. By constantly challenging you to reconsider who they are and the factors that drive their actions, these characters remain compelling throughout.There are moments when characters you're not supposed to be rooting for reveal the trials and tribulations that have shaped them, or the demons they battle. This alone is enough to humanize them, but Ragnarok also mirrors the struggles of the protagonists in the antagonists, forcing you to ask yourself, ""If I'm willing to empathize with the good guys because of what they're going through, shouldn't I do the same for the bad guys?"" The answer, it turns out, is very complicated, and that's what makes the story so captivating.Although Kratos and Atreus are the stars of the show, almost every character is in the midst of their own complicated journey. For some, it's one that will lift them from a pit of despair or pull them from darkness and onto a brighter path. For others, it's one that fuels obsessions that could be the undoing of everything and everyone. This is best illustrated by Kratos and Atreus who, by killing Baldur at the end of the last game, act as the harbingers of the end times.The consequences of this moment weigh differently on them, and what they feel is their responsibility because their actions pull them in different directions. Kratos, who has finally learned to guide his son through love instead of fear, focuses on steering him away from conflict and the affairs of the Aesir gods, but does so with the knowledge that his son is prophesized to play a part in Ragnarok and he is destined to die. Atreus, meanwhile, is compelled to prevent Ragnarok and find out who he is as Loki–the name he was given by the Giants–and sets off to find Tyr, the Norse God of War, to achieve his goals. This complicated dynamic serves as the conflict between them: a man that wants to avoid war at all costs, having learned the toll it extracts firsthand, versus a boy who believes war is the only way to unseat a power that has ruined the lives of so many.God of War Ragnarok's most impressive achievements are its exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; determinism and defiance. It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about familiesThose who remember Atreus's power-tripping fledgling God phase from the last game will also remember how frustrating it was to go through that--there's nothing more annoying than an arrogant child. But Ragnarok treats the differences in perspective between father and son in a much different way. Kratos is now reckoning with letting his son forge his own path and learning that holding on too tight could push him away. Atreus has matured since we last saw him and is now more cognizant that his actions can and will have consequences. As a result, the dynamic has shifted to where Kratos is trying to learn about his son instead of defining him, while Atreus does his best to see things from his father's perspective. And in both cases, Mimir's counsel plays a major part in this. The fruits of the journey that both characters underwent in the previous game are carried forward into this sequel and, thanks to the superb writing and acting, the back-and-forths between them are genuinely interesting. There's a newfound sense of mutual respect in these conversations, which is uncharted territory for Kratos, and in turn feeds into the motif of growth that underpins God of War Ragnarok.This is a game where you will see people change in meaningful ways. Without revealing details, new characters and those you became intimately familiar with in the previous game have experiences that profoundly impact them and the people around them. God of War Ragnarok is rich in themes to unpack, from the influence of families and generational trauma to how abuses of power and emotional manipulation can change people. God of War Ragnarok places the Norse pantheon under the harshest of lights to show how deeply flawed they are, and we're able to explore that thoroughly through our own experiences with them, as well as tales told by others that have their own. Mimir, the self-professed smartest man alive, returns to offer his insight on all things Norse history, as do the various writings scattered throughout the realms that recount complex histories, the tales of notable figures, or provide insight into the thoughts and feelings of various characters.God of War Ragnarok is a long game, but at every step of the journey, the writing and characterization make it count. It justifies that runtime by cultivating an intimacy with the characters that is only possible by spending hours and hours with them, learning how they see the world, and what influences their thinking. And pretty much every character is fascinating, but especially the Aesir gods, who can be a cruel bunch at the best of times. With the looming threat of their demise, however, each of them begins to unravel in different ways. For some, their nature becomes concentrated further, which has unfortunate repercussions. Others, however, are forced to rethink what truly matters to them.There have been a lot of takes on Norse mythology, but God of War Ragnarok's is easily one of the most memorable. It's elevated by the presence of Kratos, whose past life as a Greek God provides him with a unique perspective, but also because he's placed at the center of it. The legends that we're used to are molded around him and his son, and they adhere in a way that is truly impressive. When all is said and done, you can stand back and marvel at how neatly– and creatively–different strands of narratives and characterization from older God of War titles, the previous entry in this rebooted series, and Norse mythology as a whole have been weaved together.When it comes to confronting Kratos and Atreus's enemies on the battlefield, God of War Ragnarok doesn't make any drastic departures from the previous game, though there are some new additions and expansions made to key mechanics. Fundamentally, however, the core gameplay remains the same, and this is in its favor. My familiarity with the previous game meant it was very easy to begin tearing my way through the battlefield and the close camera angle offers a dramatic front-row seat to the brutality Kratos's legendary reputation is built upon.There's a maniacal kind of glee that comes from stomping around arenas swinging the trusty Leviathan axe to cleave Draugrs, Elves, dragons, demons, and all manner of other fantastic creatures. Even all these hours later, the thrill of hurling the axe into the distance and then recalling it back to your side hasn't diminished one bit, and with new skill trees to work through, this ability continues to provide ample opportunities to create flashy combos that hit hard.This time around, Kratos also has access to the Blades of Chaos from the outset, and Sony Santa Monica has put them to great use. As well as serving as excellent crowd-control tools and dishing out extra damage to ice-aligned creatures, the fiery blades are also used to emphasize mobility and verticality. Kratos can latch onto enemies and close the distance with them, which means they're very handy for target prioritization and even escape tactics. But they're also essential for quickly ascending to elevated platforms, where enemies often position themselves to take potshots. This means you'll need to have a much keener awareness of your surroundings and ensure these threats are addressed quickly. A small but very welcome new addition is the ability to launch off elevated areas and execute plunging attacks on those below, which ensures that the sense of momentum that is built in skirmishes isn't lost when moving around the battlefield.My favorite weapon remains Kratos's trusty fists, which hit like boulders and generate a significant amount of stun. Like the previous game, enemies have a stun meter which, when filled, opens them up to devastating cinematic finishers that are weapon-specific and usually involve rending something in two, crushing bones, or eviscerating the enemy entirely. It's a wince-inducing kind of viciousness that really drives home the power fantasy of being a god, which is ironic considering that Kratos in God of War Ragnarok is a much more balanced and, I daresay, emotionally stable person. The contrast actually ends up working for the game, as it becomes a stark reminder of how far Kratos has come to be able to cage that kind of beast within him.Combat is thrilling regardless of whether you're fighting a smattering of Draugers or trading blows with gods. It's thoughtfully designed and thoroughly satisfying from the first swing of the axe to the very lastAnother area that has been expanded is shields. You were previously limited to just one, but in Ragnarok, Kratos has access to a wider range of shields. Each one usually has a playstyle it caters to, so for those who want to focus on parrying attacks to create openings, there are a selection that will enable that. But if you're the kind of person that likes to tank damage, bigger and sturdier options are available. Shields also usually have a secondary function that is executed by tapping L1 twice to check an enemy and create space, slam the shield into the ground to break guard, retaliate with a punch that knocks them back, or even rush forward. This new wrinkle further enhances the offensive feel of combat by letting you go from the back foot to the front in an instant. It's a smart little addition that means you can switch up your playstyle, should you want to.Further enhancing what Kratos is capable of are the various role-playing systems that are tied to equipment. Naturally, equipment can be upgraded to improve their strength, the effectiveness of the element they are imbued with, or the power of the unique Runic attack, among other things. But the most tangible additions are often in the attachments, some of which will further enhance attributes while others go so far as to introduce new functionality--like sending consecutive waves of frost with every swing of the axe. Armor is treated similarly, bestowing pluses and minuses to attributes or having a unique effect that is activated by certain conditions. None of this is particularly game-changing or innovative, but it does offer the freedom to create a build for Kratos that caters to your style of play. In my case, for example, I like to play extremely aggressively and adopt high-risk strategies where parrying comes before blocking and dodging. Because of this, I focused on acquiring and upgrading equipment that rewarded me for this aggression. My entire strategy was built around rushing in and punching enemies into submission until they became vulnerable to cinematic executions, which would in turn grant me a burst of health recovery. I combined this with a relic that creates a Realm Shift, effectively slowing down time and giving me another opening to unleash a flurry of strikes or the space to hunt down life-restoring gems that might be on the battlefield.Kratos's aggression is reflected in the enemies, which hit much harder than before and aim to overwhelm. In the early hours, this is fine, but as the game ramps up and trickier enemies appear, the mechanics can struggle under the pressure of the increased speed and aggression. These enemies often absorb much more damage, have multiple phases, or move around and attack from a distance, and in many cases, there can be multiple of them. Because of this, it can often feel like you're being pulled in multiple directions and cracks in the defensive options form. I often found myself in the middle of a series of attacks and then suddenly an enemy would appear from behind, forcing me to disengage either by turning around or rolling out of the way. The quick turn input is now L1 and down on the directional pad, and even as I approached the end of the game, it felt awkward and unreliable to execute, especially in the heat of battle. You can remap this, but I never found a place where I was completely comfortable with it.This also felt like it was breaking the flow of combat, especially since the intensity made it easy to lose track of the on-screen arrow that indicates an attack from behind is coming. The indicator switches from yellow to red to provide some idea of timing, but I still found myself getting clipped a lot. Although this isn't a big deal for much of the game, in the latter half, enemies can stunlock you, so there were numerous occasions where a single enemy would open me up to being pummeled by multiple and I'd die in an instant. These moments arose in a way where I felt ill-equipped and incapable of making Kratos react in a way that could deal with what was being thrown at me, as opposed to not being able to execute because of my own skill. Since there are high-level challenges equivalent to Valkyries from the previous game–and more than a few that are even trickier–this is the kind of thing that can be the difference between life and death. Thankfully, for boss fights at least, God of War Ragnarok is much better about checkpointing as you move through phases. And when you're getting stuck into the combat, Atreus is much more capable this time around. Along with Mimir, he will either do callouts to keep you informed, or fire off some arrows at your command or of his own volition to get threats off you–he's a good lad.Ultimately, although these issues can be irksome, they are small and in the grand scheme of things don't drastically impact how the mechanics coalesce. Combat is much pacier and more dynamic than before, and it is thrilling regardless of whether you're fighting a smattering of Draugers or trading blows with gods. It's thoughtfully designed and thoroughly satisfying from the first swing of the axe to the very last.Kratos and Atreus's battles takes them across all nine realms, which is a change from the previous game where two of the realms were locked away. One of the most interesting parts of God of War Ragnarok is how it reimagines areas that were in the original game. Fimbulwinter is used as a narrative conceit to give these familiar locales new life. In Norse mythology, Fimbulwinter, which translates to ""the long winter,"" serves as the prelude to Ragnarok. In-game, it affects the nine realms in different ways. Midgard for example is besieged by a bitter cold, so when you return to the Lake of The Nine once again, it has completely frozen over. Key areas of the lake that you may have become intimately familiar with in the last game may now be inaccessible as new parts of it open up. A cold wind sweeps across the icy surface of the lake and at the center of it all, Tyr’s temple is now barely recognizable under the buildup of snow. In the distance, icy mountain peaks serve as a backdrop to a single lighting strike, frozen in place as the mark of an intense battle. Naturally, navigation is completely changed since you can no longer sail the waters. Instead, Kratos and Atreus get around on a sled that is pulled by their trusty pet wolves, which is a nice way to mix up the way you get around. At certain points, you can even use their keen sense of awareness to sniff out objectives, which is a nice touch.Svartalfheim, by comparison, looks picturesque from the outskirts, with its bright blue skies. But as you venture deeper into its wetlands, it becomes more desert-like, with craggy rocks awkwardly jutting out and collapsed wooden mining equipment filling the spaces in between. There's an unpleasant, arid atmosphere to it, and yet at the same time, it's quite the visual spectacle to behold, rich in detail and intricate in its construction. Vanaheim, home of the Vanir, is a verdant forest that has reclaimed much of the landscape; trees gently sway in the wind; moss has settled atop the water, and vegetation snakes along stone floors and up onto manmade shrines. And if you take a moment to stop and look around, you'll find wildlife nestled amongst all the green. It's a place that is very alive, which makes it a nice contrast to the coldness of Midgard or the glistening majesty of Alfheim's architecture. There are other areas I won't spoil, some of which have a good amount to see and do, while others serve a specific function.No one area in God of War Ragnarok comes across as big as the Lake of the Nine, but it seems like this is a symptom of how you're constantly moving around a variety of locations as opposed to repeatedly returning to one. Regardless, each realm has a grand sense of scale and, as you move between them, the scope of the world as a whole far eclipses what came before. While the main story campaign moves Kratos and Atreus through all nine realms, there are plenty of side quests to undertake in each of these locations. Yet another testament to the writing is that these quests are never a distraction and always present a good reward, whether that be an item or crafting materials, at the very least. However, most of the time they also deliver some piece of lore, further flesh out a side character, or give Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir something new to bond over.Going anywhere with these characters is an exciting prospect, and I often found myself just wandering around to let conversations play out or hoping that new ones would start. In most cases, they did, and I was treated to valuable character growth. In Ragnarok, Kratos is now more inquisitive, Mimir is always ready and willing to offer his insight, and Atreus takes the opportunity to make jokes at both their expense. And that's something I definitely didn't expect. God of War Ragnarok is a funny game--there are more than a few laugh-out-loud moments that endeared me to this new family unit that developed over the last game and flourishes in its sequel.And that's what distinguishes God of War Ragnarok from its predecessor, and most other action games. Despite being a story about warring gods and the end of the world, the soul of the game is something far more sentimental. You may have noticed that I've avoided mentioning the names of characters or describing plot beats, and that was intentional. To talk more about anything or anyone would be to rob you of some of the most unexpected things that God of War Ragnarok achieves with its narrative and the themes they explore. The last game's thoughtful approach to exploring fatherhood was unexpected, Ragnarok somehow manages to feel like an even more personal tale about the complicated nature of families and the people that make them up. For every moment of brutality, there is one of genuine and relatable emotion. How they land will vary from person to person, but there were multiple that left me with tears welling up. If nothing else, God of War Ragnarok further cements Sony Santa Monica's narrative team as one of the best in the business.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:The results are captivating and inconsistentIn 2019, I bought my first PlayStation 4. It was the first Big Console I’d had since the days of the slim PlayStation 2, and it came with God of War (2018), a new game from a series I wasn’t too familiar with. But I fired it up on my shiny new toy, keen to try something different. A big part of my God of War experience — something that didn’t click until later — was the one-off novelty of playing a big blockbuster on a “new” console. And it was fine. It was OK. Sitting down to write this, I realize now that the finer points of the story were almost forgettable, which is kind of what happens when you follow the game-as-a-prestige-movie story path that seems to color a lot of the AAA landscape. In 2022, God of War Ragnarök has improved on that recipe, taking a page from the success and spectacle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is, in essence, the most non-Marvel Marvel story I’ve seen in a game, from the eminently recognizable story beats — heroes face difficult dilemmas, friends become enemies and vice versa, boy meets girl, beloved characters die, and so on — to its practiced use of comedy and tragedy (the two classical storytelling genders) to push the player’s buttons.Like its predecessor(s), Ragnarök is the distillation of an everyman power fantasy, in which you enact powerful and badass acts of redemptive vengeance upon your enemies while retaining the moral high ground; you are, after all, playing a struggling parent with a whole lot of hang-ups. And while the writing does a much better job at building out the characters and their respective places in this world, the end result is a passably good but unevenly paced experience that, more often than not, feels like something I could binge on Disney Plus in any given week. Kratos and Atreus start off in Midgard, quietly reeling from the giants’ prophecy that warned of impending apocalypse and Kratos’ death. Since Baldur died, all nine realms have been thrust into Fimbulwinter — a precursor to Ragnarök — which is sort of analogous to drastic, world-ending climate change. Kratos, who shares the same weary countenance as the Ben Affleck Smoking meme, is still figuring out how to be a dad. Atreus is puberty incarnate, Mimir is still a head, and Freya — well, she’s still around, and she’s still mad about Kratos killing her son. It turns out that Atreus has been quietly researching giant lore without Kratos’ knowledge, and poking his nose into what happened to Tyr, the Norse god of war. Things kick off after an unannounced visit from Thor and his father, Odin, and Kratos reluctantly, cautiously agrees to follow his son’s quest. Like the previous game, Ragnarök builds itself around a central hub — a cozy treehouse where Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir make their home base. Gameplay is pretty much the same, too: They explore different realms, carve their way through hostile locals, and solve intermittent puzzles. Kratos has both his signature weapons, along with new toys that pop up along the way (one appears after the midway point, in one of the game’s many pacing issues), like a helpful amulet that gives you a variety of build options; Atreus has his own skill tree, along with largely cosmetic armor and limited bow upgrades. There are all the usual hallmarks of modern AAA game design: treasure chests, minibosses, and a Herculean grind to make your way through locked gates. Kratos still doesn’t have a dedicated jump button, but that’s fine — he’s a big boy.The universal core of Ragnarök is, of course, the bond between Kratos and Atreus. It speaks to emotionally constipated parents and frustrated kids, and for the most part, watching both of them grow up is appropriately maddening. The first third of the game can be grating if you’re not a fan of claustrophobic bickering and puberty-driven tantrums — I’m not talking about a taut, bristling sense of dramatic tension, but a lot of whining and grunting. But this also creates an immediate sense of relief whenever Kratos and Atreus split up to do their own thing; Atreus finally gets to be his own person on his detours to other realms, where he finally meets other kids his own age and embraces his own identity. The game, for the most part, does a good job of letting Kratos’ horrendously repressed emotions bubble to the surface. Over time, it also does well at untethering an extremely codependent familial relationship, which I can relate to as the kid of a single parent.Further into the story, it becomes crystal clear that the writers drank deeply from the well of The Great Sopranos Renaissance during the pandemic. There are all-too-familiar echoes of a made man getting pulled back into an old role, the moody scion who makes reckless decisions, the ritualistic sit-downs and mob negotiations that trigger inevitable conflict, and the overriding need for everyone to go to therapy. In ancient mythology, mob drama isn’t too far off from how gods behaved — unbridled pettiness, strict adherence to duty, maudlin displays of spite, and plenty of disguises and scams. And at the heart of it all, of course: family. Odin is a cross between Woody Allen and a neurotic Guy Ritchie mob boss, which I’m sure will appeal to some folks, but after 35 hours, I’m not one of them. It’s true that God of War’s characters (mostly Brok and Sindri) already established this anachronistic “what if ancient beings followed modern stereotypes” style, but Ragnarök seizes this approach by the neck and dials it up to 11. The result is more of an assault than an accentuation. Like all art and entertainment, games reflect the cultural contexts and trends surrounding their development, and when there’s big money involved, it means, more often than not, following a path that has already proved effective for the bottom line. Besides the Sopranos-like undercurrents, Ragnarök also channels toned-down antihero qualities of The Boys, spatters of aspirational Tarantino dialogue, and the frat pack era of filmmaking — the latter is evident in the character of Freyr, who, besides being a huge stoner, fails to show the blistering X-factor appeal that supposedly draws elves, dwarves, men, women, children, and stray dogs into his orbit. While some may delight at the banter when Thor shows up at Kratos’ house, it can feel a bit like eating reheated leftovers, albeit well-voiced ones. This isn’t a complaint about derivative media; all our stories are derivative. But how you do it matters — and when storytellers are generally too keen on remixing the hits without adding anything new, it means you have to work twice as hard to pull off a banger that still feels fresh and invigorating.Watching Odin godboss, gaslight, and gatekeep his way to Atreus’ heart is pleasantly sadistic revenge for the squabbles that came before. It is fleetingly comical to see the hypochondriac Sindri get sneezed on, and the game leans hard into the dysfunctional family dinner trope, where a humble dining table becomes the focal point for the story’s big “what now?” moments. On the other hand, characterizing Thor’s drinking like a modern-day affliction feels incredibly forced; it is simply a weird choice to bring contemporary concepts of accountability and Alcoholics Anonymous vibes to a mythological world of gods. Odin’s obsession with his own fate, too, feels poorly thought out. You can’t just shoehorn modern sensibilities into Valhalla — even with the goal of making the gods relatable and “human” — and expect all of it to fit well. “It’s me, your entire economy, speaking,” Odin yells at the dwarves, in another overwritten callback to his mob boss characterization.Despite its painful self-awareness about script structures, Ragnarök’s pacing is, at best, inconsistent. There’s a lot of filler and circular rambling — mostly on Atreus’ part — about what needs to be done to either avert or trigger Ragnarök. Atreus is also brimming with the sort of ceaseless questions that give parents gray hairs. On one hand, it does the trick: The characters are understandably anxious! But the constant hemming and hawing can get old, and in some instances, undercut the urgency and direness of the whole situation. NPCs will also routinely remind you to go blow off steam and do other things before continuing the main quest. But when the stakes are literally the end of the world and it’s already established that Odin has more eyes on you than a Ring doorbell, it doesn’t exactly make you want to run around and take in the scenery.

  Perhaps the problem lies with the frustrations of Ragnarök’s architecture as an “open-style” but non-open-world game. As in God of War, the main quest is essentially a series of tunnels pushing you toward an inevitable end. Many of these sections feel interminable, like the early portions of Svartalfheim and Vanaheim. What’s more, some realms feel like assignments rather than exciting new places — NPCs shouldn’t have to explicitly tell me to be thrilled about exploring a locale. For such an enormous world that clearly prides itself on its scale and wonder, there are times when my adventure felt like an amusement park ride (there’s a flume-boat section that looks and feels just like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad) where I just wanted to careen off the rails. Some of the mechanics, like Atreus’ chain-reaction Sigil arrows, feel like they belong in a different, more creatively permissive game that lets you actually experiment with the environments. Ragnarök constantly hints at deeper interlocking systems, but fails to follow through.Even so, Alfheim is by far the most captivating realm, possibly because there’s just so much to do, and also because the Temple of Light seems visually inspired by Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay (upon seeing the non-hive-encrusted Lake of Souls, I immediately thought of this local landmark). The temple is one of my favorite environments, next to the earthy reds and ochres of Jotunheim’s flora (and how it plays with size and scale), which had me peeking around corners for Elden Ring’s Malenia. Asgard, though, remains a wasted cipher — there isn’t much room to explore, even though a huge part of Atreus’ story arc involves going there to do just that.That being said, most of the side quests (known as Favors) are a lot more compelling than the main storyline, like Freya’s very personal mission to get closure from her forced marriage to Odin. I’ve always maintained that the real heart and soul of a game world can be found in side quests, if it has them, and Ragnarök is no different; there’s an especially engaging slow burn in the Vanaheim Crater area, where you get thrown a few crumbs about Kratos’ enigmatic late wife Laufey and her past. A fair amount of Favors involve cleaning up messes — again, back to the theme of accountability and making things right, or trying to leave something better than it was before.In a more welcome departure from God of War, Ragnarök also lets you experience, for limited periods, different combinations of characters working together. Atreus has extremely strong synergies with a new character who I won’t spoil here. And when a stronger, marginally wiser Atreus reunites with his father, it almost feels unfair to relegate him back to a sidekick role. But such is the power of the parental gaze — it makes sense to have Atreus inhibit himself around his father until dire circumstances call for dire actions. The big emotional gut punches in the story, when they do happen, do hurt (to be fair, I’m also someone who cries at cable television). The very last act of the game, where everything comes together and ties back to Kratos’ past and status as a god, felt like a bittersweet triumph for both father and son, and almost made up for all the times I wanted to knock their skulls together.For all of its flaws, there are moments in Ragnarök that well and truly rule. Mechanically speaking, the Aesir boss fights are all pretty much the same iterations of dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge — nothing to write home about, and more of a test of endurance and evasion than anything. But one boss fight, against Nidhogg, captured my heart. It’s metal as hell: a full technicolor blast of adrenaline and visual flourish and great monster design that I would replay in a heartbeat. There are also, to Ragnarök’s credit, a lot of very good dogs, and very purposefully weaponized uses of them.After dozens of hours watching Ragnarök’s characters struggle through a quasi-comical escalation of events — the kind of domino effect shitshow where one thing inadvertently sets off a chain reaction of mini-shitshows that nobody wanted to happen — it’s great to forget about fate and decorum, and simply feel content with the knowledge that everyone in this big, messy not-Marvel, not-Sopranos production experienced a promising modicum of character growth; at least enough to make it a better game than its predecessor. There is nothing life-changing about the way Ragnarök wraps up, but it delivers the same pleasant satisfaction that I get from finishing a Marvel movie that lets me run on autopilot. Even where the game can be frustrating, rote, and uneven, it’s also safe and comforting, like a rerun of Cheers where everyone knows your name and you know that you’ll never get thrown out of the bar. God of War Ragnarök, as the sum of its many disparate and often conflicting parts and influences, isn’t here to reinvent the wheel. But its single-minded desire to emulate all the hallmarks of an epic Hollywood narrative will remain both its biggest weakness and its enduring source of success. And like many, many Hollywood success stories, it shouldn’t feel this weird to say that something of this scope and scale is just OK. God of War Ragnarök will be released on Nov. 9 on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. The game was reviewed on PS4 Pro using a pre-release download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

Kotaku,"Literally, nothing anyone can say will dissuade a certain set of PlayStation fans from playing God of War Ragnarök, the latest major Sony exclusive starring Kratos, the god killer himself. After years of waiting, the hype for this highly anticipated sequel has exploded beyond control. And while I have a few qualms, I’m here to report that, yes, Ragnarök is very good and will likely satisfy folks who loved 2018’s God of War and want to experience further adventure with Kratos and his boy. God of War Ragnarök, out November 9 on PS4 and PS5, is the follow-up to 2018’s soft franchise reboot, which moved Kratos from the land of Greek gods to the world of Norse mythology. It also aged him up, gave him a young son to care for, and tasked the two of them with spreading the ashes of Faye, Kratos’ wife and Atreus’ mother. (Spoiler warning: If you didn’t finish 2018’s God of War and care about what happens, skip the next paragraph.)That seemingly simple task led the two on a large-scale adventure involving gods and monsters, and helped the pair grow closer. Unfortunately, they also invoked the ire of Odin’s former wife, Freya, by slaying her son Baldur. And Baldur’s death triggered Fimbulwinter, a three-year season of ice said to precede the world-ending conflict known as Ragnarök. Meanwhile Atreus learned he’s half-giant—known as Loki to his mother’s people—and Kratos discovered a mural depicting his death. Fun times!All of those story threads continue in God of War Ragnarök, which quickly establishes that Fimbulwinter is nearly over—meaning the world will end soon via Ragnarök—and that the now-older Atreus has been sneaking out to look for clues about his giant lineage and to possibly discover a way to prevent the cataclysm. Odin takes note, eventually forcing Kratos, Atreus, and friends to work together to foil the god’s scheming, save the world, and hopefully change fate to prevent Kratos’ demise.Big epic stuff! But don’t worry, unlike other folks online lately, I won’t spoil any of what actually happens. That in mind, what surprises me most is that while the overall narrative is extremely large-scale and epic, the game spends most of its time focused on the relationship between Kratos, Atreus, and their friends.Sure, Ragnarök is coming and Odin—one of the most powerful gods in all the nine realms—is trying to save his own skin, but that’s not really what this game is about. The greater focus is on Kratos and Atreus. The young boy isn’t a young boy anymore and he wants to live his own life and become his own man. Kratos isn’t dealing with that very well, falling back to his old ways to protect and control Atreus. This leads to tension, a lack of trust, and some tough moments. Their relationship is the heart of the game, and even when I’d sigh upon encountering yet another door puzzle, I’d push forward because I wanted to see what happened next.Like its predecessor, Ragnarök is a third-person action-adventure; that means a lot of fights, and I mean a lot! Luckily, the killin’ is good, with combat feeling both heavy and responsive. Each swing of your axe or slice of your blades looks nice, sounds powerful, and feels satisfying. This time around you start out with both the awesome ice axe and the fiery Blades of Chaos. This also means combat is a bit trickier from the start, with more complex engagements forcing you to switch up your weapons to counter different enemy types sooner. Eventually, you acquire a third weapon, a magical spear, that fits perfectly into the combat toolbox, but which I won’t spoil beyond that.The big difference this time around is that you don’t only fight nasties as Kratos, but also as his son. While you could give Atreus commands in the previous game, this time around you get to actually play as him as he goes on his own adventures—sometimes without his dad knowing. These Atreus segments help shake things up and keep the combat from getting too stale, as the young son is much more range-focused with his bow and magic. These sequences also give Atreus more time to develop into someone beyond that kid Kratos called “Boy” all the time.One particular extended Atreus segment around the game’s midpoint is one of my favorite parts from all of Ragnarök. Impressive stuff. While it might upset some fans, I’m happy Sony Santa Monica was confident enough to sideline Kratos at times to give his son more focus. The Arbiter levels in Halo 2 were a horrible mistake, but here the hero swap works and helps make Atreus a fully-formed character beyond just “the son of Kratos.” And more than just a minor detour, Atreus has his own weapons, skills, and abilities you can upgrade and tweak throughout the game.Ironically, that also adds to one of my biggest problems with Ragnarök: too much menu fiddling.I can’t stress enough how irritating I find all of Ragnarök’s various armor, weapon, and ability menus. Every few hours during my 35-hour playthrough the game added more stuff to manage and tinker with. You can upgrade every piece of armor and equipment. Some weapons and armor have to be crafted with a combination of two or three of the game’s dozens of crafting materials and currencies. You can also equip abilities and runes, and guess what, you can upgrade those, too. You also have to manage multiple skill trees, each of which contains skills that you can (yep!) tweak and upgrade.Eventually, I acquired an amulet that had a dozen slots I could fill with various combinations of gems, and I sighed. I can’t imagine Kratos would actually want or care about all this stuff. I know I don’t. While I assume some players will get a kick out of min-maxing all the stats and skills; creating specific builds and whatnot, I just got tired of it all. I’m here to rip enemies in half and toss around a big ol’ axe, not to balance my taxes via seven different menus. Thankfully, if you just pick two stats and upgrade everything around those, you can mostly ignore all the fluff and still end up a powerful god-killer.While at times God of War Ragnarök can feel more like a big DLC than a full sequel, it also tries to expand on the formula of the first game. One example of this can be found in some of the big, open-world-ish locations where you’re free to explore and complete side-quests and objectives in whatever order you choose. These segments remind me a lot of the similar moments in Uncharted 4 and Gears 5. Like those games, Ragnarök doesn’t go full open world, but instead uses these larger areas to experiment a bit.""You’ll laugh! You’ll cry! You’ll punch 200 chests and complete 100 door puzzles!""Epic, third-person melee-focused action-adventure RPG featuring a very angry dadFantastic combat, gorgeous visuals, solid writing, 120fps option, satisfying endingToo much fiddling with skills and upgrades, a few too many puzzles, slow openingSanta Monica StudioPS4, PS5 (Played) November 9, 2022Just about 40 hours. Completed main campaign and most side-quests.These freeform segments will likely be controversial. I liked how they slowed things down and let the characters talk more as I explored for collectibles and upgrade materials, but I imagine some players will find these areas too big and empty, devoid of action or fun. The one thing I believe everyone will agree on is that these sequences, like the rest of the game, are filled with puzzles. Perhaps…too many?Some of Ragnarök’s puzzles can be amusing to figure out, striking that perfect balance between being hard enough that you feel smart solving them and easy enough that they don’t become roadblocks to progress. But far too many of the puzzles end up feeling like busywork, just a way to slow you down over and over. And frustratingly, one mechanic involving triggering magic arrows with elements is far too finicky, often not working when it should. It’s a bummer that the second half of Ragnarök has so many of these puzzles, which sort of ruins a lot of the later side dungeons and puzzle rooms.Beyond the annoying puzzles and fantastic combat encounters, I was really struck by how often Ragnarök just lets things breathe. The game is filled with quiet moments, some of which can go on for as long as you want. One standout involves Atreus, Kratos, Mimir, the blacksmiths, and a few others all gathered around a small table and eating a meal together in awkward silence. The game just lets you sit there for as long as you want as characters fidget about and try to make small talk. Another involved Atreus skipping stones on a river. Again, you can skip this moment or stick around and listen to characters talk, tell stories, or share their feelings with you.That’s not to say God of War Ragnarök is a quiet game. It’s a visually impressive and exciting adventure that, at least on PS5, runs at 120fps and is filled with gore, action, and intense moments of destruction. But it also never forgets the real focus should always be on its characters. Kratos and Atreus are the heart of this new era of God of War. Ragnarök provides them plenty of quiet moments and lets you see just how much they’ve grown and developed since 2018. Getting to see the journey they take together to reach this new point in their lives is truly my favorite part of this sequel.Yes, the axe is cool. Sure, the fights are tons of fun. And I definitely enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny of the large worlds you get to visit. But what kept me glued to my PS5 for nearly 40 hours was the story of a son becoming a man and a father trying to figure out how he feels about that. I probably could have enjoyed this story a tad more with about half as many puzzles and skill menus, but even so, I found myself smiling, feeling satisfied, as the credits rolled. As I said at the start, God of War Ragnarök is very good.  "
Destructoid,"darkI typically start off some AAA sequel reviews waxing poetic about how “there isn’t much to say that wasn’t already said” about an original. But in the case of 2018’s God of War, there really is!It’s fascinating that the team kept the original continuity, but drastically changed the formula, and let Kratos grow as a character and a father. The pointed focus on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus helped make the 2018 iteration intimate and relatable. The sequel, God of War Ragnarok, mostly rolls with that premise, but it also tries to juggle a ton of extra cast members as it weaves in more stories.God of War Ragnarok (PS4, PS5 [reviewed]) Developer: Santa Monica Studio Publisher: Sony Released: November 9, 2022 MSRP: $69.99 (PS5) / $59.99 (PS4)For me, God of War really snuck up on me. I mean, we knew about it! Sony sounded their marketing trumpets from the mountaintop for this game. But playing it in isolation as a huge classic God of War fan (particularly God of War 2), I was shocked to see the direction that the team had taken with it: making Kratos a husband and a father, struggling with his violent past. I was invested in the universe out of the gate, and there’s more than enough good will there to entice me to try a sequel.Ragnarok continues the adventures of Kratos and Atreus (who is playable at points, complete with his own mini-loadout and skill trees), who are prepping for the titular potentially world-ending event, directly following the conclusion of God of War 2018. Even though you’ll miss some emotional resonance and some relationship/dialogue nuances, there is a God of War recap that you can watch from the start.Kicking off with a low key hutting expedition, Ragnarok doesn’t really waste much time. If I could describe the pacing of the story as a whole, it would be moments of urgency bundled with periods of calm. There’s a ton of walking and talking and exposition, which is kind of required given the larger scope and universe-sensitive stakes. You’re still traveling between realms this time, and it quickly becomes a road movie.Kratos is already a tad more fatherly, but still cold with room to grow. Atreus is older and more capable, but still compassionate, and a direct opposite of his dad in some ways, while still being a chip off the old block. Mimir (the talking head companion you rescued in the first game) is also in the mix, and is as entertaining and loud-mouthed as ever. Some of the most intriguing bits of Ragnarok are found in the arcs dealing with Kratos and Atreus: either together or apart. There’s some backstory that the team held from the 2018 edition spliced in, amid all of the new stuff happening.Combat, a big reason why people gravitate toward this franchise in the first place, is mostly the same: which works for me. There’s a dodge, parry and block system on the defensive side, which can be plussed-up through various means like skill trees, to create even more engaging timing sequences. You’ll mostly be using your [Leviathan] axe and blades [of Chaos], with a third main weapon that I won’t spoil here.One of the big upgrades for the first two weapon types in particular though is the ice and fire synergy. The icy axe and fiery blades can be charged up with the Triangle button, to imbue elemental powers in them and open up more attacks. Like several other action games before it (including DmC even), you can chip off shields of the opposite type on some enemy types.At first, I was worried that the team would go overboard with this system, and have the entire game based around the “opposites” approach. Thankfully that’s not the case, and you don’t even really need to use all of the tools in your toolkit to be successful. There’s so many options to approach any given fight, and you can tech into certain playstyles with skill tree and gear changes.Combat is still really punchy, and can often feel like a dance. I never really got tired of throwing an axe into one enemy to freeze it, then turning to beat up another one, then recalling the axe to finish them off. Although a lot has changed about this series combat is still brutal; with some vicious takedowns (triggered by R3 after an enemy is nearly dead) on full display. While I’m not going to spoil any boss fights, a select few are cemented among my favorites in the series (including a callback to the Narcis Prince archetype).Like the first game, sidequests are often directly tied to the story and the cast, usually after you acclimate to a new zone: without overdoing it and adding a ton of annoying pins to each disconnected sandbox. The main quest is roughly 20 hours (a little more with exploration), and all the sidequests, the leveling/gear system, and a few extras after completion will potentially double that number.Mechanically, it’s easy to tweak things to your liking too, to assist on that long ride. There’s tons of accessibility presets, including vision, hearing, motion, and motor toggles: on top of five difficulties (the last of which (Give Me God of War) can’t be reselected if you drop down. There’s options for a variety of experiences, and it’s one of the most accessible games ever made.Of course, a soft reset is kind of hand-waved away through fleeting mentions of stuff like the extreme winter “wearing down” some of Kratos’ powers, and the fact that Kratos “used” all of the armor provided to him from the blacksmiths Brok and Sindri (who return in the sequel as companions and helpers, albeit with a bit more depth).The father and son dynamic is still an emotional throughline, with Mimir sometimes acting as the reasonable impartial uncle. It’s still hilarious to see Kratos as the straight act to goofier or lighter fare, and there’s some really funny dialogue this time around that leans into that angle. The new additions are fantastic for the most part, as Ryan Hurst is incredible as a tortured Thor, and Richard Schiff really gets to spread his wings as the complicated Odin.And don’t forget the banter! There’s so much dialogue and lore to take in it’s insane at times. It can even reach the cusp of becoming exhausting, as a minor walk to a quest could end up becoming a crucial lore dump. Everyone who found themselves poring over this new universe will be stoked.Before too long though, we get a ton of characters thrown at us, some of which leave a more lasting impact than others. At times, especially mid-to-late game, I felt like this could have actually been a trilogy all on its own, with a little more time to linger on some of the events and moments therein. That same sense of overstaying a welcome can extend to the enemy types in Ragnarok: some of which are plucked from the original game, which the same basic strategic concepts.It can lead to more downtime, which may or may not gel with how you interact with a God of War game. I appreciated the streamlined and constant growth of Kratos and Atreus’ relationship in the first game, but the sequel has a lot of moving parts, and I didn’t connect with all of its cast.God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it. While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go. I’m fully on board with whatever Sony Santa Monica comes up with next.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

God of War (2018) is a tough act to follow. It got the highest possible scores from tons of publications (including us) and has sold over 23 million copies. We called it a “console-defining” game for the PS4. So, needless to say, there are big expectations for God of War Ragnarök.Fortunately, Ragnarök manages to meet and even exceed the hype for the most part. It’s bigger, bolder, and packed with more adventure than its predecessor. Unfortunately, a lackluster final act means it falls a little short of perfection.God of War Ragnarök starts three years after the previous game’s ending. Baldur’s death marked the beginning of Fimbulwinter, in which snow and blizzards engulfed all of Midgard. Because of this, Tyr’s Temple and the Lake of Nine have become an icy wasteland, making realm travel impossible.In the three years since Atreus and Kratos returned from Jotenheim, they’ve been training. Still mad with the desire for vengeance, Freya continues to hound them, but Faye’s protective barrier keeps her at bay.The two have tried to figure out a way to prevent Ragnarök and stop the destruction of all the realms except Asgard. Unfortunately, since the two have been stuck in Midgard, they have yet to make much progress. However, it comes to light that Atreus has been sneaking out of the protective barrier and has found an alternate prophecy that predicts an outcome exactly the opposite of what the original states. In it, the realms unite against Aesir during Ragnarök, defeat Odin, and destroy Asgard.The catch is that at the end of the last game, there was a mural amongst the giant prophecies that said Kratos would die during Ragnarök. So, the big dilemma throughout the game is whether to prevent Ragnarök and keep the status quo, which potentially would save Kratos, or risk it all and try to ensure Asgard falls.A recurring theme throughout the game is whether the characters’ fates are predetermined. The giants left behind many prophecies, all of which seem to come to pass despite the group’s best efforts to stop them. So, could they stop Ragnarök if they wanted to? Or are they locked into a course of action they can’t change despite knowing what the future holds.?In the background is Kratos’s struggle to let Atreus be his own person. In the three years that have passed, Atreus has grown into a young man. It’s a hard transition for Kratos, who has only barely grasped the role of fathering a boy, to now look at him as a man.The story is suitably epic, as you might expect from a game about Ragnarök. The cast is much expanded from the last part of the journey, and you’ll meet many people and see many sights that were only hinted at before. For example, Svartalfheim, home of the Dwarves, gives us our first glance at (an existing) civilization and lets us know what’s at stake if Ragnarök proceeds as prophesized.Playing straight through with no detours will take you around 20-25 hours. However, it felt much longer (in a good way) because of how much territory you cover. This time around, you’ll visit all nine realms, and the game’s scope is much greater.Despite the larger amount of territory, the pacing is excellent for most of the game. However, Santa Monica Studio’s desire to end the Norse storyline with Ragnarök resulted in the last bit feeling rushed. A few plot points, which are discussed multiple times throughout the game, end up being glossed over or dropped completely without explanation. Given how dense the game already is, it wouldn’t have been a reach to make it the second part of a trilogy.Regardless, with God of War Ragnarök, it’s more about the journey than the destination. But, of course, when you have a cast of beloved characters, any ending will be bittersweet. So even though it didn’t quite stick the landing, it’s an immensely satisfying adventure overall.Like in the previous game, there’s an ebb and flow between story missions and exploration. Again, the main quest is relatively linear, but there are many more side quests and optional content this time.God of War’s open-world gameplay primarily centered around the area around Tyr’s Temple and a few smaller areas in other realms. On the other hand, Ragnarök has large open spaces in several realms that you unlock over the course of the game.There’s a lot more environmental variety as well. As much as I love the Lake of Nine and paddling around in a boat, it was great to take a different mode of transportation for a change. The deserts of Alfheim, verdant forrests of Vanaheim, and snowy drifts of Midgard are amongst the places you can seek out knowledge and treasure. Each of them contrasts with the other not only in color palette but also in enemy type. Each realm consists of a different biome, and you’ll run into unique enemies, obstacles, and endemic life in each of them.The side quests are worth taking on for the lore alone, which is greatly expanded. Even the collectibles are woven into a tale or one of the character’s personal stories. So, even if you’re throwing your ax at 48 spectral crows, it feels like you’re doing something that affects the world instead of just ticking a number upward.Unfortunately, since it’s a cross-generation title, Ragnarök doesn’t entirely take full advantage of the PS5’s power. There are still plenty of places you have to slowly climb a cliff or travel through a long tunnel so the PS4 has time to load the next area. I hope we’ll see that trend die off soon because it’s started to wear as thin as regular loading screens at this point.Combat in God of War Ragnarök only gets a slight overhaul. Kratos plays the same for the most part, aside from superficial changes. He does get some new combat options later in the game, but if you pick up the controller straight from God of War (2018), you’ll feel right at home.One thing I’m not fond of is the removal of the shield skill tree. While you can still parry and shield bash, it’s missing most of the moves that made it a stun combo monster in the previous game.Elemental attacks are more important this time around. Holding triangle will charge a weapon with its signature move, imbuing it with elemental power. Some enemies have an elemental weakness by default. In contrast, others can generate elemental shields to protect against a particular type of damage.The combat is still fun, and it’s a blast to rack up a big combo while switching between weapons. It continues to rely heavily on juggling, timing, and stunning, which gives it a bit of a fighting game feel.There’s more to say about the combat system, but some aspects of it are unlocked via story events. So, instead of spoiling the fun, I’ll wrap it up by saying the fighting in this game is more of an evolution of the previous title than a reimagining. However, there are more options for defeating your foes overall.God of War Ragnarök is a triumph. It’s a swansong for the PS4 and one of the best first-party games for the PS5 so far. It’s bigger than its predecessor in every way.The game’s only flaw is the weak climax. Everything up to that part is gold. However, it’s hard to find a conclusion that’ll satisfy everyone when the stakes are basically everything.9Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Forbes,"God of War RagnarokGod of War Ragnarok is not a wholly transformational entry for the series the way its predecessor was. It couldn’t be, at least not in the same way.The leap from the original God of War games to an entirely new format with the release of the blockbuster reimagining in 2018 was something that would be impossible to replicate exactly. So, Ragnarok will just have to be content being an exceptional sequel to arguably one of the best games of last generation. And that should be good enough for everyone.This ain’t “DLC,” a common critique leveled at Ragnarok by some in early previews, citing similar zones and animations. This is every bit as sprawling and massive a game as the original, even if of course the first game lends it some old realms and flying Leviathan axe maneuvers. My normal “Give Me Balance” difficulty playthrough lasted just over 30 hours, which included exploring a good amount rather than mainlining the central story. But having saved some sidequests, optional bosses and challenges to the end, I finished nearly everything by 37 hours or so. A hundred precenting the game would take a few more than that (so many damn Odin ravens to find), and all of this would take much, much longer on higher difficulties with a lot more failures in combat.There is little God of War Ragnarok fails at, period. Everything you liked about the first game is here, again, but with enough added to it in order to warrant the length and depth of a sequel. The “Dad and Boy” dynamic is still in place, though this time it’s a teenage Atreus leading the central quest as he tries to discover his destiny. Now it’s Kratos following Boy, not Boy following Kratos. And he rarely calls him “Boy” anymore, with a major theme being Kratos trying, and often failing, to trust his nearly grown son with their fates.Fimbulwinter has warped the realms, freezing Midguard in ice, creating blowing sandstorms and poison swamps in other regions. Meanwhile, a vengeful Freya is still out for justice after the deadly final moments of the last game. But as we know, the Big Bad here is her ex-husband, Odin, and his Large Son, Thor, acting as bodyguard and enforcer. An extremely early battle against Kratos will show you just how well-matched the two legends are in open combat.God of War RagnarokBut if the last game wasn’t a clue, this is not the original God of War series. The story is not necessarily going to be Kratos racing around to kill every god in the pantheon in increasingly brutal ways. And the way the game develops Kratos and Atreus’s rivalries/relationships with Freya, Odin, Thor and other, unnamed characters I won’t reveal here, is easily one of its most compelling aspects. Sure, there are still plenty of touching parenthood moments to be found here between Kratos and Atreus, just like the last game, but if Ragnarok improves on God of War in one significant way, it’s how it utilizes the entire cast to enormous affect here, new characters, but also old ones. The standouts of the bunch by the end are Freya, and the dwarven duo Brok and Sindri, believe it or not, who are given, far, far more to do this time around than upgrade your gear (though they also do that).If there’s one area where the game’s story suffers, it’s not the writing or performances, which are all stellar, it’s the pacing. While I enjoyed meeting Thor and Odin, I kept track, and it was seventeen hours until I saw them again in the story. Sure, some of that was me wandering off to explore, but it still felt like a lot. Similarly, there are a few story segments that really, really drag, like a casual bit of adventuring in a relatively placid realm hidden from Odin that lasts probably two hours longer than it needs to.Level pacing itself can be weird too. The environments are sometimes overly linear and oppressively claustrophobic. There are some very cool, quasi-open world spaces to explore, but a lot of it is narrow hallways with similar-feeling puzzles and the all-too-present “shimmy through the tight space” mechanic that is wildly overused.But most of the areas are gorgeous, fun to play through and engaging, especially the further you get into the game where you will start to design some areas specifically designed for “choose your own adventure” exploration. And another area where God of War Ragnarok shines is its combat, above and beyond even its predecessor.I cannot speak highly enough about how much I enjoyed fighting in Ragnarok here. There are way, way more build options this time around, tons of armor sets, weapon mods, shield mods and companion mods, in addition to interchangeable abilities and a skill tree that upgrades individual skills the more you use them, both rewarding your favored playstyle and encouraging diversity in tactics while fighting. With plentiful upgrade materials to max out a number of sets and playstyles by the end, I had a blast putting some of these builds together. My all-time favorite was an armor set that allowed me to poison enemies when beating them with my bare fists, and then after that, they took 40% more melee damage while poisoned. Combine that with a rune skill ability that dramatically slows time and more mods to increase melee damage while time is slowed, and I was tearing up enemies and bosses alike.God of War RagnarokIn terms of the difficulty of combat, like the first game, it’s a wide range. Normal story stuff is not going to be terribly hard for the most part, at least on a standard difficulty. But yes, there is another Valkyrie-equivalent miniboss challenge spread across the game (not literal Valkyries again, don’t worry, they didn’t recycle all of them), with a mega-tough final boss I have yet to beat. Two mega-tough final bosses, in fact, this time, but that’s all I’ll say. Other than to note that I really enjoyed the ending of the game, both narratively, and in terms of the post-credits gameplay pathways it offered to keep doing things in the world. Even though yes, you will finish it all eventually. This is not God of War-as-service.God of War Ragnarok is a beautiful, moving game, no longer purely centered on a father getting to know his son, but also about vengeance, forgiveness and attempting to change both prophecy, and the people we used to be, both of which prove to be equally difficult. It’s almost impossible for me to imagine those who loved the last God of War will not also appreciate this one just as much, minus a lagging stretch here or there, and the fact that it can’t be as transformative as the initial leap from the Greek games.I have many, many questions about what comes next for this series, but I will save that for another day, in addition to a deeper discussion of some new mechanics and additions that may be considered spoilers, so I didn’t mention them here.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowAs the finale in the Norse saga, God of War Ragnarok is the perfect conclusion to Kratos and Atreus' adventure.God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece. The team at Santa Monica Studio has somehow managed to take what the 2018 game started, lift the story to dizzying new heights, refresh the combat systems, and tie it all off with enough emotional impact that it has left me thinking about the ending for days.The story of God of War Ragnarok picks up a few years after the events of the first game. The previous actions of Kratos and Atreus have ushered in Fimbulwinter, dramatically altering the climate of the nine realms.In his tireless drive to be prepared, Kratos has been training Atreus over these past years in anticipation for what comes next, whether it’s Ragnarok or something else. Throughout this time, Atreus has grown from a child into a young man with his sights set on finding answers.After a brief encounter, and a proposition, Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir set off on their next adventure as the prophecy of Ragnarok looms overhead.Told through its iconic seamless transitions, the tale of God of War Ragnarok manages to be both grand and awe-inspiring but also genuine and personal. It’s touching to watch Kratos continue to try and guide Atreus along the path he thinks is right, all while Atreus wrestles with the pursuit of independence that every teenager seeks.The narrative does wonders to expertly sidestep the common trope of moody and unlikable teenagers. Atreus often psyches himself up before a talk by having solo conversations where he plays both sides. He’ll offer up his own wishes and then imagine the retorts his father would make. It’s a genuine moment that reminded me of my own youth, practicing an idea before taking it to my parents.These emotional and relatable moments are sprinkled all throughout the story. Despite its fantastical setting and its grandiose worldbuilding, the characters, relationships, and themes are all grounded. It’s impossible not to be drawn into Kratos’ single dad struggles, Atreus’ lack of agency and desire to learn who he is, or the myriad of other characters and their plights.More than once throughout this unforgettable narrative I found myself welling up with emotion. The way the writers continue to develop and grow these characters is commendable. But it wasn’t just tears I was shedding, I was also hooting and hollering with excitement or laughing at the comedic timing.While the writing is impeccable, what lifts the narrative further are the performances. Christopher Judge as Kratos and Sunny Suljic as Atreus come together to create some of the most emotionally raw scenes in a video game to date. I would stare, misty-eyed, watching the character’s expressions, feeling the weight of the scene and all the emotional undertones being delivered by the actors. In addition to Judge and Suljic, Ryan Hurst as Thor, Richard Schiff as Odin, and Danielle Bisutti as Freya offered some spine-tingling and soul-crushing performances.To put it plainly, the whole story of God of War Ragnarok feels like an epic. It feels like one of the mighty tales that the characters talk about while you're playing. It’s mythological, grand, and world-changing but it’s also incredibly personal and genuine. It’s a gripping journey from start to finish and an absolute master class in storytelling.God of War Ragnarok’s excellence flows from its narrative into its gameplay. While the combat remains similar to the first, it’s been expanded with additional options and mechanics for Kratos and Atreus. It’s just different enough to feel refreshing without drifting too far from what was on offer in the first, in fact, it feels like a refinement.Kratos can still impale his foes with the Blades of Chaos to either pull them to him or send a fiery blast down the chain. These skills now exist as two unique moves attached to different buttons and each boast powerful upgrades. The changes to each weapon’s systems are subtle and overall improve the formula.Beyond the moves, players will find new Runic attacks to use, additional relics (Ragnarok’s form of the talisman), as well as a retooling of the enchantment system. Armor comes with unique effects and set bonuses, allowing players to really lean into a certain playstyle. I switched between a couple of sets, one that increased my base damage for a short time after using a Runic attack and another that increased the drop chance of health gems.Weaving these all together allows Kratos and Atreus to feel like a powerhouse throughout the campaign. This is heightened thanks to the soundtrack which is of mythological proportions. As Kratos swings his axe and carves up foes, the music swells and crashes. During intense quick-time cutscenes the orchestral score explodes to the beat of Kratos’ fists. Everything about the combat and music leaves you feeling like the god that you are.The power fantasiy is so good that I was concerned I wouldn’t have an opportunity to flex my power and test my mettle in difficult boss fights at the end of the story. Thankfully, Ragnarok has its own sort of Valkyrie-like encounters to keep you busy. These are a brutal challenge and exactly what the game needs to keep players tweaking their builds and collecting resources to upgrade their gear.God of War Ragnarok is not a strictly an open world game. Like the first, there are realms to visit and explore, each with its own unique environments, side quests, collectibles, as well as Nornir chests with their light puzzle mechanics. The puzzles also have their own separate setting in the expansive accessibility menu, giving players more time or slowing down objects to make them more forgiving.Players will be running, climbing, or using the Blades of Chaos on set points to swing between ledges when exploring the realms. There is a new addition in the form of a sled pulled by two wolves that allows Kratos and Atreus to move around the snow-covered realm of Midgard with ease. In the warmer environments the canoe returns, and although it’s a bit cumbersome to use, it offers an opportunity to hear Mimir’s stories and soak up the gorgeous vistas.Part of the joy of exploring these realms is who you get to explore them with. Without revealing too much, while Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir are the core trio, there are opportunities to fight alongside other characters in God of War Ragnarok. While their input to the combat is similar to one another, it affords the player a chance to learn more about these characters and see how they all interact outside of cutscenes. Again, it’s a small change from the first game but one that highlights the attention to detail Santa Monica Studio brings to the table, knowing just what to add to make an already stellar experience an exceptional one.Santa Monica Studio has captured lightning in a bottle for a second time. God of War Ragnarok left me speechless; it’s such a beautiful game both visually and narratively. The team has somehow managed to take what made the original such a wonder and expand upon it, delivering to players a masterpiece, an experience that sits atop the God of War pantheon.This review is based on a PlayStation 5 code provided by the publisher.

In Ragnarök, the young and eager Atreus of the last God of War has been replaced with a headstrong pre-teen who is constantly pushing against his father’s headstrong attitude. As the title implies, father and son find themselves struggling through the realm-scarring Fimbulwinter, a prelude to the world-ending battle of Ragnarök.Yet even the prospect of the end of the world isn't enough to re-ignite Kratos' lust for war. He's eager to avoid the battle, seeing that as the best way to fulfill his monomaniacal desire to protect his son at all costs. Atreus, meanwhile, sees his dad as too cautious and struggles to convince Kratos to trust his more active (and risky) plans to avoid an outcome that is literally fated.Ragnarök’s writing and characterization push very hard in an attempt to achieve the same kind of heartstring-tugging moments of growth and understanding between Kratos and Atreus that the last game achieved effortlessly. Unfortunately, for the most part, these moments don’t land as well as they did in the last game.Part of the problem is the performances: Kratos and Atreus have some of the weakest and least effective line deliveries in a game that is full of strong voice acting and motion capture. As a result, I never fully bought the pre-teen angst that leads Atreus to explode in a surprising (and momentous) burst of defiance at a key point in the middle of the narrative. Kratos’ near-constant defensive crouch at the thought of his son being in danger, meanwhile, is much less interesting and affecting than his growth into a reluctant but caring father from the last game (and often seems in direct opposition to all the battling he does in between cutscenes).Another problem is the game's lack of narrative focus. While Kratos and Atreus are still central to this story, Ragnarök diverts its attention constantly to narrative interludes based on the small, reluctant band of allies that has formed around this core pair. Aside from distracting from the parental-and-child tale that could serve as the game’s emotional core, these digressions end up more than a bit uneven.The game puts a lot of effort into a heavily telegraphed “redemption” arc for Freya, for instance. The goddess’ transition from murderous rage after Kratos killed her son to a reluctant partnership doesn’t have much in the way of believable justification and ends up feeling unearned. I also found myself utterly unable to get interested in the overwrought backstory of the two dwarven brothers who serve as the resident blacksmiths for the crew.I was a bit more intrigued by Tyr, another former god of war who suffered a long confinement under Odin and, like Kratos, has renounced violence as a way of life. Unlike Kratos, though, Tyr does his best to stick with his newfound pacifism, offering a compelling and tortured take on whether an immortal force can really change its nature. And while Atreus’ interactions with his father didn’t really connect emotionally, extended sections where he pairs with various young female companions shine bright, full of the kind of flirtatious banter and emotional upheaval that can characterize youth.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

VG247,"What did we think of Kratos and Atreus' latest adventure? Find out in our God of War Ragnarok review!
It says everything you need to know about God of War Ragnarok that you can go from listening to the captivating tales of Norse mythology, as told by your best mates as you float gently past dense riverbanks of lush jungle and along placid lakes surrounded by snow-capped mountains, to squishing giant flying eyeballs with your bare hands in the space of about 90 seconds. 

Neither feel out of place or jarring, but the flying eyeballs probably disagree.

Although it starts out remarkably similar to the 2018 God of War both mechanically and graphically, God of War Ragnarok gradually builds into a meaningful evolution for the series, expanding the scope of gameplay both stealthily and overtly, while delivering a tense and twisty story that bends legend around its characters in exciting and endlessly interesting ways. 

God of War Ragnarok takes place across all nine realms of Norse cosmology, as Odin – king and all-father of the Aesir gods – moves literal heaven and earth to try and avert the doomsday that’s prophesied to bring about his destruction. At the end of the last game, Kratos and Atreus learned their unwitting part in the prophecy, and God of War Ragnarok deals with the ramifications of this new knowledge, and the fallout of the events that led up to acquiring it. 

It’s a very direct sequel and, maybe because of a few years of distance and watching beautified PC port footage in between, starting Ragnarok almost felt like booting up the last game and playing on right from where it ended. 

In the Sony first-party pantheon, despite the upgrade in hardware, Ragnarok feels a lot more like the jump between Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3, rather than the more recent example of The Last of Us Parts 1 and 2. This obviously makes sense given both the development time between the rebooted God of War and Ragnarok (which would have been just a couple of years without a lengthy delay), and its cross-generation availability as well.

It looks and feels great, with detailed environments and distant landscapes in every realm, but there aren’t any huge technical or graphical feats that leap off the screen immediately. And that could make for a disappointing first impression if you’re expecting something that’s going to make your PS5 whur like a jet engine, like it does your PS4. 

That’s not to say that God of War Ragnarok is a complete retread, or does nothing to take things forward. What’s familiar swells over the course of the game – whether it’s combat styles, companion abilities, traversal or puzzle-solving – to the point where you realise later on in the whole experience just how much is different and new.The first few hours, then, feel quite close to what you’ve played already, and if Sony Santa Monica tried to introduce a lot of this more quickly, just for the sake of difference, it might have felt overwhelming or disparate, so ultimately it’s the right choice for the game as a whole. Even if, sometimes, you're encouraging it all to speed up a bit.

You’ve got a lot of time to explore the mechanical nuances once they start to show up, though. Where the console-showpiece spectacle action genre used to be a linear 6-hour firework, God of War Ragnarok is as chunky as Kratos’ own bicep, taking me just over 40 hours to complete the main story (with  about 75% of side stories, collectibles, and extra tidbits thrown in, too) on the regular difficulty. 

At the end of a main story branch, you almost always have the option to break off into a relatively compact – but very dense – open exploration area filled with environmental puzzles, mini-bosses, and fetch quests. Diving into these spaces is heavily encouraged not just for the world and character-building exploits(the main “Favours” in each area are generally good), but because they offer a lot of the best stuff and upgrades, making them pretty vital if you want to make smooth progress in the next chapter.

These areas aren’t disposable, either. More activities appear pretty constantly as the world state changes throughout the main quest and even after the credits roll, continually giving you an incentive to keep the realm-hopping family road trip rolling. But the persistent diversions can also be a bit distracting, both in the exploration areas and along the main path.There’s something hidden around nearly every corner, and sniffing it out can take you out of the moment a bit. If you’re a magpie, like me, you'll be thinking more about the collectible you need to smash in the corner while a cutscene’s playing than what’s actually going on. Those with short attention spans, be warned.

But if you know that you can’t really miss anything and you can always go back and get things that you do miss – which you know now, because I’m telling you – hopefully most people can push through that completionist itch. 

I wrote in my early impressions preview that the beginning of God of War Ragnarok’s story had me a little worried because it laid on the emotional moves thicker than the hide of the world snake, Jormungandr. Right from pressing “New Game”, it’s all heavy hearts, long sighs, and sombre silences that threaten to tip into becoming maudlin – and at this point, that feels like a Sony studio party trick.

However, character motivations quickly reestablish themselves to make everything feel more earned – and from there, Ragnarok never loses its great moments. An early standoff between the game’s main players is crackling with intense atmosphere and menace, and the unexpected and intricate characterisations of many of Ragnarok’s antagonists are almost as revolutionary as the renewed depth to Kratos’ character in the 2018 God of War. 

These moments come more frequently, more intensely, as the game edges towards its climax. Then, from the summation of the last full realm arc until the blockbuster finale, it’s gigantic, cataclysmic set-piece after set-piece – wielding the full weight of everything that’s built up to this point to grip you as aggressively and wrathfully as the characters battling on-screen. 

It’s not just about the engrossingly spectacular, but the quieter parts, too. Drawing on themes of responsibility, loss and, chiefly, the uncertainty over changing stages of life gives us an emotional impetus and makes the edge of the action cut much more keenly. Whether the story mulls on growing up, fatherhood, or death, it does it reflectively and knowingly. And it always makes you care.

The only quibble I have with all of this is where characters have a tendency to basically state the insinuations of a scene; saying the quiet part out loud when it was already well-earned and clear from the context and performances. I wouldn’t say that it undercuts anything too important, because when the real emotional moments touch down they land like a swan on water.But it does feel like there was some undue worry that people wouldn’t “get it”. This is particularly felt at the end of the main Favours in each area which often finish with a conversation which comes off a bit like a plenary at the end of a school lesson or the coda at the end of a sitcom – “so what did we all learn today?”

But that's all overshadowed by the action, anyway. Once you get used to the touch-tight camera angle(which can make it feel like you’re getting brained by things outside of your peripheral vision before you master the audio and visual cues), the arsenal of weapons, combos, and abilities at your disposal feels incredibly flexible – with supplementary items to modify almost every option available to you. 

So much information is communicated to you so naturally by subtle things – the clunk of an inert attack on an armoured enemy, or the slight twinkle of a fully-charged swing – that finding your own style within the skillset is instinctive. And that’s without the jarring stops and slowdowns that give knuckle-cracking impact to every hit and have you throwing yourself into each shot, like a football manager kicking every ball for their team on the sidelines. 

You get the biggest sense of this in the many, passionately fierce boss fights that punctuate the game. They do a great job of incorporating unique mechanics without coming off as cheap or overly simple. And, really, these boss fights are emblematic of what makes God of War Ragnarok great: they’re hugely successful meldings of an involving story and brutal action that not only produce an eye-popping, absorbing spectacle, but an impassioned investment in the outcome as well. 
God of War Ragnarok launches on November 9, 2022. Reviewed on PS5, code provided by publisher.
