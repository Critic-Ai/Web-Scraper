Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.Much like Leon S. Kennedy, Capcom was not in for an easy ride with this one. There are great games and then there are the classics, games so forward-thinking and complete that they shape entire corners of our industry. In Resident Evil 4's case, every third-person game since has worn its love for Capcom's masterpiece on their over-the-shoulder sleeves: Everything from Gears of War to Dead Space to The Last of Us runs because Capcom showed them all how to walk. Remaking a game that remade its own genre is nothing less than trying to catch lightning in a bottle one more time.What is it? A remake of one of the best action games ever made.

Link Official siteCapcom almost managed it and, for the longest time, you'll think it did. The opening of the Resident Evil 4 remake is outstanding, slightly streamlining the original route into the village in order to get you into the first big set-piece: A knock-down drag-out village brawl that, almost immediately, takes place with the constant sound of a chainsaw revving as its owner chases Leon everywhere. I played on Hardcore difficulty, which is recommended for those who've completed the original game, and the name fits. I must have died in this encounter six times before re-adjusting and beginning to figure out the endless little tricks baked into Leon's moveset and the enemy behaviour. One difference you'll notice almost immediately on this difficulty is that running away is not quite the god-tier strategy it once was: These ganados don't just run after you, but will catch you and inflict grievous damage. If there's one thing you'll realise quickly in this game it's that, after the rather flavourless Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Capcom has rediscovered the joy of killing players brutally.And it will do it to you again, and again. The original's death animations for Leon were another standout feature (Dead Space in particular strove to recreate this) and you can sense the animation team here wanted to out-do daddy, and has produced some of the grisliest, grimmest and sometimes amusing deaths you'll ever watch. I've seen Leon lifted into the air on a chainsaw, I've seen a giant bite his head off, cultists poke his eyes out, dogs ripping his throat to shreds, clawlike fingers poked through his brain, huge pulsating worms nom his face, razor-sharp tendrils slice through his tender bits… honestly I could write five paragraphs on the ways I've seen Leon die, and I'd probably still miss some.This is the Resident Evil 4 remake's great strength. Where the original came up with a new threat, the more human-seeming ganados and their swarming tactics, the remake doubles down on the idea, making enemies tougher and more persistent while subtly altering Leon's toolkit to deal with it. This has always been a game about crowd control: Keeping things off your back, whittling down a seemingly unbeatable mob to its last member, gritting your teeth and blasting through a sea of bodies and tentacles. The remake throws everything at you and then, while you're gasping on the ground, the kitchen sink sails through the air right at your head.This can be utterly exhilarating. Resident Evil 4's greatest fights are all here, bigger than ever, and feel better than ever to wade through. The core of combat remains location damage, shooting enemies in the legs or head in order to stagger them then following up with melee attacks—a brilliant push-pull dynamic that sees you staying on the edge of mobs until you need to dash in and unleash a roundhouse or suplex. A superb new addition is the ability to parry with your knife (though of course not all attacks can be parried), leading to these extended sequences of utter chaos where, through some combination of instinct and extreme firepower, Leon somehow walks away from an army with nary a scratch. One particularly well-done element of this is, if you'll do a mental drum roll, reticule wavering. I know, I know, doesn't seem like much, but the original game incorporated the idea that Leon's aim would always be slightly wobbly, and the remake takes this and runs with it. Hold out your pistol and, over a few seconds, the reticule will wobble vaguely around the point you're aiming at before settling and tightening up to a smaller area. Enemies won't wait around to give you time to line up your shot, so you'll need ice-cold nerves if you want to be an accurate gunslinger.The moment-to-moment combat is as good as Resident Evil has ever been, and that's saying something: That shout of ""Un forastero!"" still sends chills down my spine every time. The remake also initially stays relatively true to the original game's outstanding structure and pacing, but once you're out of the village things change and not for the better. The Resident Evil 4 remake makes some bold decisions about elements of the original and, in many cases, that decision is simply to remove them. Capcom has been upfront about the game removing the QTE elements (though these are still a part of combat in dodges and arguably even the parry) but it doesn't have any ideas about what to replace them with and so moments of great drama and peril—little sequences that I find memorable—just aren't here. The review embargo prevents me saying exactly what is here and what isn't but, if you have any familiarity with the game, you'll notice the absence of one, then another, then by the time you're near the end sadly conclude this isn't going to deliver much of what it should.That might seem entitled. But Resident Evil 4 was always a slightly crazy game. Where the first game's mansion was coherent and semi-believable as a setting, Resident Evil 4 takes place in an unspecified European wonderland of bizarre contraptions, shooting galleries, medieval castles, and an endless menagerie of grotesque and toothy experiments. And a lot of it just hasn't made the cut. One iconic sequence in particular—I'll not say which as we've been asked to avoid revealing certain specific changes—has here been replaced with an utterly anodyne and short section that simply isn't fit to lace the original's boots.This element of the remake begins to encroach more and more as the game hits its second half stride, and I can only describe it as timidity. Where the original felt like it was constantly over-reaching, always surprising the player with new demands, new environments, and wild one-off challenges, this seems content to settle into more of a standard corridor shooter rhythm. The combat is so good that even when the game's unambitious it is borne aloft on a cloud of shotgun shells, but the further you poke into that soft underbelly the more standard it begins to seem.Memories are obviously hazy things, but the castle always seemed to me a gigantic playground, filled with back-and-forth warrens and secrets to be uncovered. Here it feels like something designed by Naughty Dog, opulent and gorgeous and fun to walk through, but always with a very obvious big finger pointing out where to go next. I'm not saying the original game was some expansive freeform epic, because it wasn't. It was every bit as linear as this. But it felt a lot bigger, and kept out-doing itself until the very end in a way that this just doesn't.I suspect that, for those who haven't played Resident Evil 4, the experience of this remake will be to discover a very good third-person shooter, and wonder why everyone made such a fuss about it in the first place. And the sad fact is that, where the original game was pioneering and ended up defining a genre, this remake is trammeled by that legacy and bound by what Resident Evil 4's successors, almost all of which are inferior games, have done to the template.You'll feel this especially in some of the boss fights and more extreme encounters, where it's almost like Capcom dials back the threat level somewhat so everyone can get through it. There's an infamous room in the castle, where Leon and Ashley gradually have to work their way to the back through hordes of enemies, before Leon guards Ashley as she operates a contraption, and the version of it here feels like such a normal fight that you wonder, in a game that elsewhere is happy to batter you, why they'd soft-soap such an infamously tough challenge. It feels like the balance is wrong in some encounters, and part of the mystique and terror is lost. The less said about the gimmicky versions of certain other classic boss fights the better.And yet… that core remains so strong, so vital, and the old rhythms beat beneath it. My delight at acquiring the Red9 pistol made me feel 20 years younger, and the upgrade path had that familiar pattern of gradually turning an unwieldy, bucking peashooter into the hand cannon of every secret agent's dreams. The expansive armoury, which really blossoms after a few chapters, soon forces you to choose which weapons to carry around and upgrade and tinker with, and while there are no surprises the distinctions between them and their efficacy in different situations makes Leon, in those hectic gun-switching grenade-tossing moments of chaos, feel like some high-tech Rambo.Resident Evil 4 remake jettisons many parts that made the original so good without having any idea of what to replace them with.Resident Evil 4 remake undoubtedly improves on the original in some ways. Personally I'll always miss the line ""You're [sic] right hand comes off?"" but the B-movie script is much-improved, and the way the storyline has been tweaked, in some cases significantly so, is well-handled and retains enough of the schlock factor that the personalities shine through. Ashley, doomed to forever be the damsel in distress, is now a much more forthright and capable companion, while Luis' reinvention retains the rogueish charm and sands off his more leery side.Perhaps something like that smoothing out is the real problem here, however. Resident Evil 4 may be one of the best games ever made, but it is also wildly uneven in places, and this remake feels like it has been planed to remove those spikes and jutting edges. It feels like a much more straightforward experience, start-to-finish, than the original. It doesn't have these far-off detours and wild one-offs then, with a few notable exceptions, re-does the surprises of the original in new ways without ever quite surprising you enough with how it does so.If Resident Evil 4 remake was an original, standalone title, it would be a good game indeed, and anyone who plays this will have a fun time (maybe not on Hardcore though: it really is brutal). But this is not a standalone game, it's a remake of one of the greatest games ever made and, when it comes to the crunch, it falls short. Where the original felt expansive, this feels cramped, and where the original went on breathless tangents and threw one idea after another at the player, this feels (in the second half especially) like it settles into a groove and isn't especially interested in breaking free of it. Much of this is forgotten when, in the utter maelstrom of battle, you're surviving by the skin of your teeth and blasting through a sea of limbs and teeth with knife-edge parries and outrageous firepower. But outside of this exquisite action core, Resident Evil 4 remake feels like a game that runs out of ideas and, most unforgiveably, jettisons many parts that made the original so good without having any idea of what to replace them with.Resident Evil 4 re-invented thirdperson action, and ever since it came out I've been waiting for another game to blow the bloody doors off in the way it did. But this is not the heir to Resident Evil 4, so much as a tribute. Resident Evil 4 remake is merely a great thirdperson action game that, sadly, takes too much inspiration from what followed: Rather than what started it all in the first place. Resident Evil 4 remake is a great game in its own right, but can't hold a candle to the original.Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

Eurogamer,"New corpse of action.
It's no exaggeration to say that Resident Evil 4 was one of the most influential games of the early 2000s. Its popularity served to standardise the over-the-shoulder third-person camera and precision aim feature that became ubiquitous in almost every action game that followed for decades to come. It also marked a turning point for one of the most popular horror franchises in gaming, as it leaned into fast-paced action and interactive cinematics to create a truly unique and exciting experience as it assuredly danced players from one dazzling set piece to another. There are moments from that game permanently etched in my memory. A corpse dangling silently from a pitchfork inside an abandoned shed. A dog that knows how to repay a debt. ""There's no time for resting."" The bitch in the red dress. Bingo?

All that to say, there's a lot riding on the Remake of what is widely considered one of the best games of all time. After two and three, we more or less know what to expect from Capcom's Remakes - rebuilt from scratch to a high standard, they've generally excelled at capturing the spirit and style of the original games, keeping what works and modernising what doesn't while utilising the RE engine to make gore glisten and chiaroscuro of piles of trash pop. Resident Evil 4 Remake follows this formula and builds on it, displaying a confidence in both the original game's strengths and its own innovations to deliver something that feels at once intimately familiar to old fans and excitingly fresh for newcomers.

In the Resident Evil 2 Remake, large sections of the RPD, as well as other memorable locations, were redesigned and reshuffled to work cohesively with the updated gameplay and to make sense in a more photoreal world. In Resident Evil 4 Remake, large sections of the game - particularly in the earlier chapters - are essentially completely unchanged from the original, so much so that, scene to scene, I knew exactly which part of the 2005 game we were up to. It's that funny thing about remakes and remasters; done right, the new and improved version tends to look exactly like the original does - in your head. But having gone back to the 2005 iteration since completing the RE4 Remake, I can decisively say it has aged far more than you probably realise, and the Remake does an incredible job of capturing all of the details, moments and mechanics that matter, while bringing everything else up to a standard modern players will enjoy. 

The bulk of the action in RE4 Remake falls into the 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' category, but there are still a few modernisations that players will have come to expect from this genre - ever since the original set the tone for that same genre 18 years ago. The ability to crouch and stealth past certain enemies is a tiny, welcome lean back towards survival horror territory, for example, with the idea behind it being the developers' desire to give players as much freedom and variation in how they approached the game's combat as possible. So as well as stealth kills, Leon also now adds the silent bolt thrower weapon and knife-based ground finishers to his repertoire, letting you pass by some encounters without so much as making a peep. Plenty of players will pass this up in favour of the loud and extremely in your face approach that Leon S Kennedy excels at, as well they should, but more player choice here is no bad thing. 

While the original is roundly praised for popularising the third person over the shoulder perspective, it should also be held somewhat accountable for the proliferation of Quick Time Events in the many games that followed seeking to emulate its success. The 'action button system' was implemented to ensure players didn't get bored during cutscenes, and though praised at release, is very much a product of its time. The development team for RE4 Remake are aware of this, which led to one of the biggest mechanical changes in the game - the knife parry system. This was born from the desire to make the infamous knife fight with Jack Krauser more directly controlled by the player as opposed to a series of button prompts, after which the dev team apparently realised there was no reason not to implement a parry mechanic throughout the entire game. So, now, most enemy attacks can be defended against and even deflected with the knife if your timing is up to scratch. It's an addition that makes total sense in the context of the game and adds a pleasing risk/reward system to every hatchet and kitchen knife thrown Leon's way - do you play safe and simply dodge out of the way, or do you take a swipe and feel invincible if you time it just right?

Your knife then becomes even more of a vital tool - particularly when ammo is running low - but it isn't 100 percent failsafe. Your knife now has a durability metre and will break with repeated use if it isn't repaired by the merchant. Different uses of the knife cost more or less in terms of its durability - stealth kills on unsuspecting enemies cost next to nothing, while using it to stave off an otherwise deadly grab attack by pressing R2 at the right moment will deplete its usage by almost half. You can repeatedly press X to struggle free instead and keep your knife sharp, but this will drain some of your health in the trade-off. 

In addition to these last minute saves, there are still other QTEs of sorts where you'll need to press circle or the equivalent in time to avoid specific enemy or boss attacks, but these are greatly diminished in number from the 2005 release. Crucially, they flow much more comfortably with the gameplay rather than the 'press x not to die' moments of the original game. There's one new mechanic that allows enemies who circle round behind you to grapple Leon and allow other foes to get some hits in; breaking free requires you to mash X. Thankfully this doesn't feel like a QTE for the hell of it - rather, it adds to the extreme tension and outright panic in those moments where Leon, outnumbered and surrounded, is using every tool in his XL attaché case to survive.

Speaking of that iconic and physics-breaking piece of kit (seriously, where does he store it on his person?) the attaché case returns with all of its original quirks plus a few new enhancements. You can now customise the case at typewriters to grant yourself small gameplay boosts. Changing its look can increase probability drops for certain types of ammo among other enhancements, while you can also attach up to three cute charms that offer other bonuses - a chicken charm will ensure any eggs Leon consumes restore his health 100 percent, for example (just try and suppress the mental image of him cracking a raw egg into his mouth mid-battle, much to Ashley's horror). How charms are actually acquired is a fun little surprise I don't want to spoil here, but let us take this opportunity to reassure you that for all its gorgeously spooky new visuals and foreboding atmosphere, Resident Evil 4 retains its campy sense of fun where it matters. 

As well as being able to organise Leon's equipment in the attaché case, you can create ammo and health items in the separate crafting screen. Or, you can quickly craft items by dropping them on top of one another - as with the original game - directly in the case. Also updated is the map screen, which in a similar fashion to the Remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3, logs useful info as you play, like the locations of items you've seen but haven't picked up, puzzles you've yet to solve, and locked and unlocked doors. I personally like the fact that it immediately alerts you to items you missed and gives away the location of some extra curricular quest solutions too, but some may rightfully prefer to ignore these hints in favour of finding things for themselves.

Of course, no Resident Evil 4 Remake would be complete without the merchant, and although some fans of the original game will be unsure of his new voice lines, they'll be thankful for the new services he offers regardless. You can buy, sell and tune up weapons and equipment at any of the merchant's numerous pop-up stores throughout the game, but he's now expanded his business to include trades. In the original game, spinels were small jewels that you could find and sell for quick cash, but here in the Remake they become a currency all their own, given by the merchant in return for doing small requests for him throughout Leon's adventure. These requests usually tie in nicely with your current activities - so there's no lengthy backtracking required - and feature a pleasing assortment of tasks for you to do in return for a slack handful of spinels. 

The most basic of these include tracking down a gold chicken egg or shooting down some blue medals in and around a rundown farmhouse, but there are some unique little side adventures in there too. The jewels are then rewarded and traded with the merchant for special items, most of which you won't find elsewhere. And, if you find yourself short of cash for other guns or weapon upgrades, there are lots of treasures to find, stick some other gemstones into, and resell. You'll find yourself making your way through most of RE4 Remake with the contents of an airport Tiffany's tinkling in your pocket, as the game helpfully breaks down gemstone value multipliers that award you more cash for certain colour and size variations, meaning you'll want to keep extra stones on you at all times to make the most of every trinket.

There are several new gameplay sections and story additions in RE4 Remake that we'd love to discuss in more detail but can't due to fear of spoilers and embargo restrictions, but we will say there has clearly been an immense level of care and attention to detail paid to every facet of Resident Evil 4 Remake's design. Some boss fights are functionally and stylistically identical to the source material, while others have been completely reworked and reimagined. Some locations are brick for brick lifted from the original, while other areas - particularly later in the game - have been streamlined to better fit the flow and pace of the story. There are other structural shifts within the narrative - some huge, some barely noticeable - but tonally everything meshes to form a pleasingly cohesive whole. 

The trouble with Remakes is you're damned if you do and damned if you don't - change too little and players will ask what the point of it all was. Change too much and you risk upsetting long-time fans while thumbing your nose at what made the original game great in the first place. Remaking one of the most influential games of the last twenty years is no small feat, yet Capcom has pulled it off here. Leon is just as dryly sassy, Ada is a smoke show, Ashley is considerably less annoying than in the original (even if her fashion sense has suffered horribly), and the baddies are all given their time to shine and then erupt in a mass of entrails and extra limbs. Oh and the regenerators? Still utterly terrifying. There are a few sequences that fall flat, particularly late game, but overall this is as good as remakes get. Even if the bingo reference is slightly lost on new generations.

Metro GameCentral,"The beloved bonus mode for Resident Evil 4 is now available for the remake as free DLC and it’s just as good as the main game.For most normal people the Resident Evil 4 remake has been one of the highlights of the year so far (the not so normal ones ended up review bombing it because it wasn’t sexist enough). It managed the seemingly impossible tasking of reimagining not only one of the most highly regarded video games of all time but one which is riddled with anachronisms that don’t translate well to the modern era. There was one flaw though, in that there were several missing modes from the original – but thankfully it hasn’t been a long wait for Mercenaries.It’s widely speculated that Separate Ways is going to be paid-for DLC, but Capcom promised that The Mercenaries mode would be free and available just two weeks after launch, and they have delivered; in more ways than one.Although Mercenaries mode has featured in many Resident Evil games, starting with Resident Evil 3, it’s always been the Resident Evil 4 incarnation that’s been a fan favourite, since the game’s peculiar limitation of not allowing you to move and shoot at the same time made the action more compelling. But of course, the remake’s controls are much more straightforward, so the question is whether that makes Mercenaries intrinsically less interesting as a result.As nonsensical as it may be in real world terms the limitation of not moving and shooting always felt like it was channelling the spirit of golden age arcade games, where gameplay is far more important than logic. However, it’s clear that Capcom understands what a difference this makes to the pacing of the action and while The Mercenaries is the same basic idea as before there are some new twists to keep the magic alive.The Mercenaries is not a complicated concept. It uses a few maps repurposed from the main game and simply has you running around trying to rack up a high score before the time runs out. That’s essentially all it is but because the combat is so intrinsically entertaining – both mechanically and in terms of the hordes of enemies the game throws at you at once – it’s extremely compelling.If anything, the crowds of enemies are even larger than in the story campaign and there’s almost nowhere you can go on any of the maps where you can put your back to the wall and just blast away as they advance. You can make a stand for a few seconds or so, but unless you keep on the move and remain aware of everyone around you (the sound design helps very well in this regard) your assault on the high score table is going to fail.The best way to get a decent score, apart from taking down the various mini-bosses that appear, is to hit a combo. The more enemies you shoot in the same narrow window of time the more you earn but it’s more complex than that, since if you shoot a more dangerous enemy, like one of the chainsaw sisters or the minotaur, then the number of points you earn from them gets a major boost.Doing well at Mercenaries involves a surprising amount of strategy, not only choosing the best moment to take out an enemy but deciding when to use explosive barrels and when to break off a fight to escape and set up in a new safe space, or to collect ammo or time extensions that litter each map.Most of this is the same as it was in the original game but where the remake tries to compensate for the new control system is that you can also get a small time extension by killing enemies with a headshot or with a knife, or via other special means such as with a grenade or barrel. This adds a welcome extra layer and also means there’s a benefit to standing still and aiming more carefully – just like the original.There’s also something new called mayhem mode, which is basically a rage mode and activates after a meter builds up, to give each of the unlockable characters their own special abilities. For Leon that’s just increased speed and power but Luis can use dynamite in mayhem mode, Krauser uses his Las Plagas sword arms, and HUNK gets infinite ammo.Each character also has their own weapons loadout, which you cannot change, with Leon being the all-rounder, Luis having a better pistol but worse melee weapons, and Krauser being the opposite. The fourth character is HUNK (an Umbrella soldier who always turned up as an unlockable in the early games) but unless you have to do something special to unlock them there’s no sign of Ada Wong or Wesker.Perhaps they’ll be available as paid-for downloads, or maybe as part of Separate Ways. There’re also only three stages, even though there was four in the original, so that may be being treated in the same way.To unlock the four characters all you have to do is get an A rank on the ones that are already there, so Leon unlocks Luis, Luis unlocks Krauser, and Krauser unlocks HUNK. An A rank (it goes up to S++) is achieved by getting 100,000 points, so it’s not that hard if your Resi skills are already relatively polished.We’re not entirely sure what we did to unlock the different stages, but it may be as simple as just playing the previous one. Although we never got less than a B rank so maybe it’s that.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationAs with the main game, our fears that the more generic control system would undermine the appeal of the original have proven unfounded and the remake of The Mercenaries is great fun and makes the whole package seem like even better value for money than before, with enormous replayability for a single-player game.We can only hope that Capcom doesn’t get greedy with DLC – at least not for anything that was in the original version – but either way The Mercenaries only makes a great game even better.Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and PCPrice: Free (main game is £54.99)Publisher: CapcomDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: 7th March 2023Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Publisher: CapcomIt's exhilarating, for the most part. The previous Resident Evil remakes have, let's be honest, really been about ammo management, as you essentially countdown to trouble with each bullet fired - every shot taking you closer to an empty mag and the problems that ultimately brings. Here, it's more about dealing with the constant, ratcheting pressure of an enemy mob that's always shuffling closer. They encroach, they edge around the sides; step into the vague corners of your eye, or lurch suddenly and drunkenly right up to your face. And they just keep coming. The result, particularly in the opening hours, is a procession of fingertip grasping, running on instinct and fumes fights to buy just a few feet of space to think.The village area which opens Resident Evil 4 Remake is fairly relentless. Playing as Leon S. Kennedy, the European backwater you're scoping out in search of the President's kidnapped daughter is about five parts angry murder villager to one part rotten wooden shack. But while most of my immediate memories of playing are of panic and things grabbing my face, overall one of the Remake's best strengths is knowing when to leave you alone. There's plenty of space to explore, to backtrack, and to absorb the atmosphere of it all between all the screaming and running away. Resident Evil 4 Remake is a spectacularly pretty game, so having the time and space to soak it all in is welcome. Capcom's RE engine continues to deliver incredible amounts of detail, and I've easily lost hours just looking at things - from animal jaw bones dangling from strings to dusty, moonbeam riddled castles and lab benches scattered with equipment - it's always a beautiful thing to look at, and Capcom uses these impressive visuals well to craft and develop a series of creepy, unsettling atmospheres as you gradually progress.  In the beginning, the village is full of wrongness; a dark and dank murder town full of leering locals long since separated from their sanity. Everything reeks of that 'you shouldn't have come here' energy you usually get in slasher movies, where high school teens break down in the middle of nowhere. That gives way to a castle full of a more silver screen horror vibe, with heavy robed, mindlessly chanting monks; its decaying extravagance countered by dimly lit, grimy dungeons. Then there are monster-filled mines that go full creature-feature, abandoned labs full of science gone wrong (including one of Resi's best/worst monsters), and plenty more. The variety and breadth of tones keep things incredibly fresh, interesting and (remake aside) unpredictable throughout its 20 or so hours. It almost feels like several different, smaller games expertly dovetailed together at times. There are sections, beats, and creatures that could carry entire games under different circumstances, appearing almost as cameos in Resident Evil 4's grand scheme. When Remake does deviate from the original framework, it does so in a way that makes sense, or at least makes things more interesting. Resident Evil 4 is largely a faithful remake overall, rather than an interpretation, with modern sensibilities applied to elements like controls, checkpoints, and so on. The original game literally set the template for modern third-person shooters, and there's less that actually needs changing compared to the static cameras and pre-rendered backgrounds that Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake had to do away with. While most of the characters, bosses, and locations are largely the same there are some changes. The biggest probably being a new degrading knife system where your blade takes damage and can eventually break. Parrying blows and attacking stunned enemies has the least impact, while using it to get out of being grabbed can see chunks drop off the durability. Once it's gone you lose those abilities until you can get it repaired or find a new one. It's an interesting idea but negated somewhat by the ease with which you can repair it every time you visit the merchant. It's a panic, initially, to see your knife slowly falling apart or to lose it completely, but once you realize you can just keep fixing it, that soon passes. There are a few aspects of Resident Evil 4 Remake that I'm not entirely sold on. The inventory management has a range of little wrinkles – like how weapon attachments still take up space even when they're affixed to a gun. I know it makes real world sense but somehow it feels wrong, for me, to combine a rifle and a scope and not get any space back. Especially when you can spend hours jigsawing all your earthly possessions into a strictly limited grid. Only being able to put guns into storage is another odd choice when most supplies can only be found or crafted. Not being able to store ammo (or buy it) pushes you to pick weapons and stick with them. I bought a classic Resi gun, thinking it would be great to pull out of storage for boss fights, but ended up never using it after repeatedly discarding or selling its scarce bullets to clawback vital Inventory space for other items.  The combat, while generally excellent, does also have some occasional irritations too. Wherever space is intentionally limited, that exhilarating and fraught dance to survive can quickly become a mess as you're passed from one mauling monster to the next without any useful ability to deal with the situation. Leon's stodgy sprint is a clumsy way to relocate under such pressure, and the times where you have to fight in small, crowded areas are often the most frustrating experiences in Resident Evil 4 Remake. In contrast, I found all the boss fights surprisingly easy due to having a single threat to avoid and plenty of space to do it in.The combat, while generally excellent, does also have some occasional irritationsThere's a slight aiming wobble too which, combined with enemies ducking and diving, can be exasperating early on. I've endured absolute scenes where the randomness has left a cartoon-like halo of bullet holes around an opponent's head despite having the barrel on their nose when pulling the trigger. I get the idea of panic affecting your aim, countered by taking time to steady and calm it – but when the entire combat model is largely 'six people in a shed hitting you' it can be hard to line up those shots with care. It gets better over time, with upgraded equipment and skill, but be prepared for some real 'oh come on' moments in the opening hours. I am largely pulling at blood crusted straws here though, as I loved pretty much all of Resident Evil 4 Remake. It's a tightly focused, exciting action game, with some genuinely exhilarating fights to survive - not to mention plenty of great locations, enemies, and set pieces. It knows where to apply pressure, when to let you breath, and balances fear, excitement, and exhilaration almost perfectly throughout. The fact Resident Evil 4 Remake works so well, largely channeling exactly the same spirit as the original, only goes to show why it was a classic in the first place. The only question now is this: What's next on Capcom's remake list, and when is it Dino Crisis? Resident Evil 4 Remake was reviewed on PS5, with code provided by the publisherI'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"They said it couldn’t be done but Capcom’s remake of the legendary Resident Evil 4 is a triumph, even if it’s not quite the game you remember.For years the best advice anyone could give to Capcom, whenever the subject of a Resident Evil 4 remake came up, was just not to do it. The original is not only an all-time classic but one of the most influential video games of all time. It popularised the concept of the third person shooter and created a foundation for modern action games that is still as relevant today as it was when the original launched on the GameCube back in 2005.It’s not that Resident Evil 4 is a sacred cow that cannot be touched, since Capcom’s existing remakes of Resident Evil 1 and 2 are excellent, despite several liberties being taken with the second one (Resident Evil 3 is, as always, entirely superfluous). Instead, the problem is that Resident Evil 4 is very much a product of its time, in terms of its goofy tone and abstract control system.Modernising the game by making the dialogue and controls more sensible is relatively easy but by doing so you lose much of the charm. Compromise is almost always the enemy of creativity and yet somehow Capcom has managed to thread the needle with such skill that all the early concerns now seem needlessly pessimistic.Resident Evil has one of the longest running storylines of any major franchise, with not a single reboot since its inception in 1996. However, Resident Evil 4 was a soft reboot, in that while it exists in the same continuity the gameplay is completely different to everything that came before. Not least the fact that instead of zombies you have much more intelligent human enemies, as well as other more monstrous foes.The game is also not really a survival horror. There are a few jump scares and creepy moments – more so in the remake, thanks to the more realistic visuals – but this is much more a straight action game.The plot is pure nonsense, and never seems to have intended as anything else. You play as Leon S. Kennedy, as he seeks to rescue the US president’s daughter, who has been kidnapped by an evil Spanish cult. Although given the outrageous accents and the depiction of rural Spain as still being stuck in the 15th century it’s a good job nobody ever got offended by it. Resident Evil 4 is dumb and silly and it always has been, but that actually feels very refreshing today, given how seriously some modern games take themselves.As the prototypical third person shooter, Resident Evil 4 is a very straightforward beast in terms of mechanics, especially in the remake. There is a grand total of six different control schemes, but all allow you to move and shoot at the same time. Although we’d swear the movement when aiming over the shoulder is faster now than it was when we previewed the game last year, which makes it seem a little less unique than we originally expected.Not being able to move and shoot is not a question of nostalgia; it strikes to the very core of the game’s design and pacing. In most action scenes you are beset by dozens of enemies at once, in encounters that always last far longer than you expect, and which often have no obvious endgame – other than your grisly demise. The only thing to do is keep mobile and not get boxed in, so not being able to shoot and move is exactly the opposite of what’s needed, which is why the original was so outrageously tense and exciting.Of course, that limitation makes no logical sense in real world terms, it’s a conceit that was invented purely to make the gameplay more interesting, but that, sadly, is a level of abstraction that modern video games no longer allow. The furthest the remake is willing to go is making movement while aiming slightly slower than normal.Some part of us feels we should resent the remake for giving in like that, but it’s still such a joy to play the change becomes more an issue of academic interest. The sense of constantly being under pressure, never knowing where your next ammo clip is coming from or how long the current set piece will last, is still maintained perfectly.It’s especially impressive because the game isn’t particularly difficulty, it’s just incredibly nerve-racking, as you rush around the small sandbox areas, constantly looking for additional weapons and items or new vantage points to chip away at the hordes of enemies.The famous village sequence at the start of the game (which is also the centrepiece of the free Chainsaw Demo) is still the most iconic but there are dozens of similar set pieces throughout, including a number of sieges, where you desperately try to barricade windows to keep enemies out. Some are recreated almost 1:1, some are greatly expanded, and some are completely new but while they can go on for a very long time that’s never a complaint and as soon as they’re done you just want to go back and do it again.Although you rescue Ashley, the president’s daughter, relatively early on she’s constantly getting re-kidnapped and so is only around as a companion for a fairly small percentage of the game. Her AI isn’t great, and she doesn’t help in combat, but there are far worse escort missions in gaming than hers.She’s still a bit of a wimp but then she is supposed to be just an ordinary civilian and Resident Evil has plenty of other far more capable female characters – including Ada Wong, who is particularly good in this (her side story Separate Ways is not included in the remake but is hopefully coming as DLC).As well as the cheesy dialogue, the previous Resident Evil remakes also downplayed the equally silly puzzles, that have always been an important part of the franchise. This remake brings them back, and even adds in new ones, although they rarely deviate from collecting various ludicrously shaped keys (unicorn horns and lithograph tablets are just two examples) and using them in very obviously signposted locks.This element is necessary as an occasional palette cleanser, but the complete lack of any actual puzzle element does become tiresome. Instead, exploration is a much more satisfying distraction, with useful loot lying around every corner, as well as new secondary objectives primarily conveyed via new blue request missions.These are usually simple things like shooting a set number of targets, or taking on an extra hard monster variant, but while their rewards come in handy, they do spoil the pacing a bit, as they often involve backtracking to earlier locations, which is something the original game never really did. Although the obvious solution to that is to just not do them.The remake includes many other brand new elements, from unique items to whole new set pieces and areas. Many of the boss battles have changed too, although most are at least as good as the original (or still just as bad, in the case of the anticlimactic final fight). We’re still somewhat upset that the original’s QTE encounter with Krauser, which was easily the best use of QTEs ever, is now represented as a standard real-time fight, but it is a very good one and helps justify the new focus on knife combat.Knives are still used to escape an enemy that’s grappling you but can also parry weapons, including projectiles. However, each knife takes damage when used and is either eventually destroyed or rendered unusable until you get the Merchant to fix it. Speaking of which, we were quickly won over by his new voiceover. He’s much more obviously cockney now and while he repeats some of the lines from the original, he’s got a number of new ones that are almost as good (aka bad).Overall, though, the game is more serious than back in 2005 and while it does keep some of the original dialogue the bingo quote at the end of the Chainsaw Demo implies that happens more than it does.Some of the sillier set pieces have also been toned down, such as the over-the-top fire traps in the castle and one of the more infamously absurd boss battles, but there’s always visual or dialogue-based references to how it used to be, that strike just the right balance between honouring the original and making it more palatable for modern audiences.And that is the game in a nutshell: a rare compromise that manages to have its cake and eat it. In a way though, despite it technically changing more in terms of its presentation and controls, Resident Evil 2 still feels closer to its original than this, when it comes to everything but the dialogue.We took 25 hours to finish the game on our first playthrough, and while that involved more backtracking and careful exploration than the average player is likely to attempt we were still left wanting more by the end – which you get thanks to a significant New Game+ option and the promise of The Mercenaries time attack mode, as free DLC after launch.Given the challenges of recreating a game that belongs to such a very specific period of time, Capcom should be applauded for executing such a difficult reimagining. Many of the details may be different but the core appeal, the very peculiar mix of goofy fun and almost unbearable tension, is almost exactly the same as the original.What flaws the remake has are largely subjective and while we can see some people getting frustrated that you can’t store health and ammo at save points, even though you can guns and attachments, that’s just another affectation meant to make the gameplay more interesting. It works too, because as silly as the attaché case is the difficult question of what to fit within its finite confines is a serious tactical decision, even if the fact you can pause the action at any time to peruse it does, literally, take you of the action.The attaché case is one of many elements that would never have been part of the game if it was made as a brand new title today but what ages the gameplay the most is the lack of a dedicated dodge button. Occasionally there are context sensitive dodges but otherwise you just have to turn round and run away if you want to get out of something’s way and that almost feels more archaic than the idea of having to stop to shoot.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationBeyond that, the only real fault is that Resident Evil Village, the most recent mainline entry in the series, steals so much from the original Resident Evil 4 that there’s an unfortunate case of déjà vu here, especially in the castle areas. That’s unfortunate but the remake is a much better game overall. It’s graphics are also superior and, like everything, else find a perfect midpoint between the monochrome brown/grey colour scheme of the original and the technicolour delights of the modern era.The remake of Resident Evil 4 could never have had the same groundbreaking influence as the original, but it is just as entertaining, and still not quite like anything else around… even after all these years.In Short: More a reimagining than a straight remake but despite the difficulty of recapturing lighting in a bottle, this is both a loving tribute to the original Resident Evil 4 and a great game in its own right.Pros: Fantastic action, with some superbly well-orchestrated set pieces. A lengthy story with mountains of content and meaningful secrets. Excellent graphics. Cheesy tone is maintained better than previous remakes.Cons: The modern controls make the game feel more generic than the original and no longer completement the gameplay as well. At the same time, a dodge move is sorely missed. Non-puzzles feel increasingly pointless.Score: 9/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and PCPrice: £54.99Publisher: CapcomDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: 24th March 2023Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Game Informer,"There are two entirely different audiences for the Resident Evil 4 remake: those who have played the original game, perhaps multiple or even dozens of times over the last 18 years, and people who have never played it, but want to know what the fuss is all about. Let's start with the former: unequivocally, if you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you must play the remake. It's not only one of the best action games in recent memory; it's the best Resident Evil since, well, probably the original Resident Evil 4. From the jump, the remake overwhelms you with danger. The faithfully recreated ""village"" section throws dozens of enemies your way, requiring you to handle the numerous combat scenarios or die quickly. As it was in 2005, it's a punch-in-the-face type of opening, the game telling you this is how it will be from here on out; get used to it. Running for my life, terrified of the chainsaw-wielding maniac chasing me through crowds of nasty folks, all the while desperately shooting at enemy kneecaps, parrying incoming projectiles, and running in and out of houses as my scarce ammo count gets closer and closer to zero was tense in a way this level hasn't been since I was a kid. That the game maintains this tight-gripped action until the credits roll is a feat of game pacing. For the first time since 2005, Resident Evil 4 is scary again, and I couldn't be happier. It's incredible. Gameplay has been expanded – namely, you can walk and aim your gun at the same time now, as well as the aforementioned parrying and new melee options – which makes the already-great bones of RE4 feel modern and fresh. Despite my constant anxiety, I had so much fun that I welcomed every major combat encounter. Especially by the time I unlocked the more powerful weapons – shoutout to my semi-automatic shotgun – blowing through scores of enemies felt fantastic. And don't get me started on the game's brutally gross gore system; blasting off heads and arms and even shooting enemies entirely in half as blood flows like confetti out of a pinata has rarely looked this fantastically disgusting. I am a freak, and the Resident Evil 4 remake indulged my sick love of virtual gore. From a visual and level design perspective, the Resident Evil 4 remake knows precisely when to be nostalgic and when to be fresh. As a lifelong fan of the original, seeing some of my favorite levels and combat arenas recreated 1:1 on the PlayStation 5 was novel and fun. That the next room might be a complete remix or reinvention of a different area, however, kept me on my toes, as if I knew the subject of the painting, but all the details were in new colors. Nevertheless, I welcomed every new addition as much as I did the old standbys. Perhaps the most elbow grease went into rewriting the game's story, though the narrative beats are all the same. You play as Leon Kennedy, now a special agent of the United States president sent to a remote Spanish village in search of the president's missing daughter, Ashley Graham. At that village, all hell breaks loose. You're soon confronted by scores of angry locals infected by a parasite, Las Plagas, making them easy for the game's main antagonist to control without completely losing their mental faculties. Leon's nightmare takes him through the remote village, into the bowels of a baroque castle hoarded over by a ghoulish Napoleon wannabe, and then finally onto the shores of a military stronghold. All the while, monsters, gore, and death follow. It's campy, goofy, and over-the-top. And much of that charm is retained here, but with the addition of much sharper writing and better characterization. Ashley, in particular, has been rewritten as a real character with emotions, intelligence, and charisma. That other characters don't sexually harass her like they did in the original is also a huge improvement. Across the board, the cast has received an overhaul, making the protagonists more likable, the enemies more menacing, and the twisting threads of the plot somewhat more coherent – all the while never losing what made the original story so fun in the first place. I could write a metaphorical book about all the ways I love the Resident Evil 4 remake, but it might be simplest to tell you to look down at the score at the bottom of this page and sum it up like this: if you loved Resident Evil 4 in the past, you will love this remake. Period. Point blank. It is a love letter to a game that fans know up, down, left, right, and center, a faithful recreation at all the right moments, but with expert refinements and modern sensibilities. It's also a radical reimagining when it needs to be, a wonderfully fun game fully confident in its ability to remake one of the best games of all time. What it lacks, however, is context. And that's important. Quickly following any mention of the original Resident Evil 4 is discussion of its camera. Rather than the fixed camera angles of its predecessors, the original game placed the camera behind Leon's back. Most importantly, he was slightly off-center to the left. When he aimed, you looked directly over his right shoulder. This perspective is, of course, the template for almost every third-person video game that came after. Resident Evil 4 changed the shape of the game industry. As great as this remake is – and let me reiterate, it's incredible – I do not think it will show you why Resident Evil 4 was so groundbreaking. It just can't. There's no universe where this game will ever be as important as the game it remakes. It can't come out in the same time, space, and context as the first Resident Evil 4. Somewhat ironically, it's only as good as it is now because it exists in a post-Resident Evil 4 world. And so, while I think it can show you why Resident Evil 4 was fun, goofy, and endearing, if you're someone interested in just why this old game has such an enduring legacy – especially one strong enough to warrant such a massively expensive remake – your best bet is to still play the original, to try and put your mind in a pre-Resident Evil 4 world to understand how that game could change everything. Or better, you can watch a few minutes of a Let's Play or read one of the thousands of articles about it. That will make playing the remake a much richer experience; you can see decades of lessons learned throughout the game industry about how to make a third-person action game thrilling, fun, and mechanically effective reapplied to the source material. It's a refinement, not a reinvention. And that space is the most interesting place this remake can occupy. The Resident Evil 4 remake is about everything I could've wanted. But importantly, it doesn't overwrite its predecessor. If anything, this new version reinforces why the original Resident Evil 4 is a game people should still seek out, play, or at least watch and learn about. But as a love letter to one of the greatest games of all time, as a new historical artifact that reinforces why the source material was so landmark in the first place, this new trek through the Spanish countryside is as good as it gets and makes a great game that much better.

GameSpot,"Capcom raises the bar for what a good remake is and simultaneously preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time.By 
    Kurt Indovina
   on March 17, 2023 at 12:01AM PDTHow do you remake Resident Evil 4, an experience that changed the way action games are made today? It is, at best, an unfair challenge and, at worst, an impossible task. So, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel a second time, developer Capcom has doubled down on the brilliance of the original's design--elaborated on it, and finely tuned the experience. The result is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all time.If you're not familiar, the premise of Resident Evil 4 is straightforward: Leon S. Kennedy, the cool and handsome rookie-cop-turned-government-agent who you may remember from his escapades in Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City, has been sent to rural Spain to track down Ashley Graham, the US President's missing daughter. Yes, it's a ""save the princess"" trope but, even 18 years later, its juxtaposition against the survival-horror genre serves as an immaculate setup for the game's over-the-top set pieces. In this case, the princess is in another castle, but it's a castle besieged by parasitic infections and mind-controlled cultists, so you'll have to blast your way from a rundown village to a military island to get her back. While the core pillars of tense, up-close-and-personal action and careful resource management remain welcomingly unchanged, improvements to character development elevate the story as a whole. Now more than ever, Capcom is aware of the tone and humor of the game after it felt accidental in the original. This time, it feels like Capcom is leaning into it, striking a considered balance between heart-pounding horror and laugh-out-loud cheese.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil 4 Remake Video ReviewThis time, Leon isn't just a cool-looking dude with swoopy hair and a sweet jacket, who says sometimes cool, sometimes corny things, and does super-cool stuff. He's more than that: Now he's a cool dude with cool hair doing cool stuff who also acts like a human being. This is a Leon who carries the trauma of the Raccoon City incident from Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives more weight to his character and serves as compelling context for his motivation to save Ashley Graham. This time around, it's not just another assignment for Leon--it's a chance at redemption for the lives he couldn't save in Raccoon City. This narrative continuity is a strong thread that ties the remakes together with emotional heft, making this new era of the franchise feel stronger and more unified than the originals.Those concerned this added layer of humanity has changed Leon's iconic action hero cheesiness shouldn't worry, as Leon is still an absolute one-liner cornball. In fact, this aspect of his character has been turned up a notch. Through the chaos of blood-soaked battles where he faces down crowds of the parasite-infected Ganados, Leon still takes the time to toss out memorable one-liners. And it's not just for banter, as these moments are used to ease the nerve-wracking tension of fighting off villagers by cutting through it with some much-needed levity. Narrowly surviving each encounter feels like a relief, but when Leon throws in a casual ""bill me for the repairs later"" quip after shooting a lantern that erupts into flames, it almost feels defiantly triumphant. The world of Resident Evil 4 is grimy, filth-covered, and horrific, but it's also one where a government agent trying to save the President's daughter says, ""Not bad, right?"" to himself after suplexing a Ganado so hard its head pops like a water balloon. Capcom managed to take me to the edge of my seat in a desperate fight for survival, only to catch me off-guard and make me laugh with some comical quip. Its ability to repeatedly do this without disrupting the overall tone of the game is one of Resident Evil 4 Remake's crowning achievements.Facing off against the Ganado is more stress-inducing and terrifying than ever before. Their frenetic movements, unexpected lurches, and vicious attacks have all been intensified, making each encounter a panicked waltz of crowd management while fighting for breathing room and hoping you've got enough ammo and health to get you through the skirmish. You'll often be outnumbered on all sides as they juke and duck out of the way of your aim, fumble over each other to grab you, and push you toward the pitchforks, sickles, and knives wielded by other members of the horde. While the Ganados were similarly tricky in the original game, this time around their movements feel more tangible and weighted, which also makes the potential consequences of being backed into a corner or overwhelmed even more terrifying. Seeing Dr. Salvador, the chainsaw-wielding potato sack-wearing maniac, stomp through the crowd to try and tear Leon apart, resurfacing a fear that repeated playthroughs of Resident Evil 4 had long since dulled.These scenarios are absolutely heart-pounding and, despite the hair-raising tension, I couldn't get enough of it because combat just feels so damn good. From blasting a wall of enemies with a shotgun, to a quick parry of a stampeding pitchfork-wielding Ganado, to delivering a sweeping roundhouse kick that pushes back a crowd, the Resident Evil 4 remake's action has a kinetic brutality that feels like controlling chaos in the most satisfying way.Each combat encounter requires constant adaptation and tactical adjustments on the fly. Sometimes the situation calls for running bravely into a crowd of enemies to thrust a knife into a downed cultist before it stands back up as a much deadlier and more erratic creature. Others require a little creativity, like sticking a well-placed remote mine next to a crowd of enemies before switching to a shotgun to eliminate an enemy's wooden shield and then watching everyone go boom. Either way, there's a playground-like nature to combat in which you can manipulate the enemy's movements to your advantage, such as luring an enemy into their own bear trap or parrying a Molotov cocktail back at someone, engulfing a crowd in flames. It all feels punchy, visceral, and badass to pull off. This was the case with the original, but it is further amplified in the remake thanks to a greater variety of enemies--some of which are entirely new--while other returning ones have been reimagined in terrifying new ways. Without spoiling too much, some enemies now change the dynamic of how crowds act, often pulling the rug out from under my feet just as I had become comfortable in combat, forcing me to contend with a whole new level of stress.Leon has, of course, been given more versatility to take on the more capable and deadly Ganados. Fundamentally, the absence of tank controls means he's much easier to control in the heat of battle, but now he also has the ability to utilize stealth and his trusty knife-fighting skills. Knives now have durability (a carryover from Resident Evil 2 Remake), with each use slightly damaging it. Knives can now be used to parry nearly every attack by hitting a button just as an enemy strikes, and to instantly break free when being grabbed. These new additions elevate the tango of violence when dealing with a crowd of enemies by creating a sense of momentum. Each fight can quickly become a dance of maneuvering weapons, managing resources, and executing parries. And being able to cycle back and forth between these actions in quick succession makes it feel like you're fighting as hard to survive as the Ganados are to kill you. If your trusty knife breaks, you'll have to scavenge for inferior knives that are considerably less durable until you can repair yours. And even then, you'll need to have the space to store them in your attache case. Naturally, resource management is once again a major pillar of the Resident Evil 4 remake, as is the fiendishly compelling meta-game of organizing the contents of your case to fit together herbs, gunpowder, weapons, and crafting resources like tetrominoes. For those that would rather skip this, you can also hit a button to have everything automatically arrange itself.[Resident Evil 4] is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all timeResident Evil 4 Remake is full of smart quality-of-life changes that build on what the original revolutionized, with the strongest example of this being the change in combat capabilities for Ashley Graham. Thankfully, Ashley no longer has a health bar for you to manage with your own resources as you escort her. Instead, when Ashley is injured, she'll become incapacitated, forcing you to juke around enemies in order to get to her and bring her back to her feet. This is much less punishing on the player than outright failure but maintains the tension of the cooperative dynamic by forcing you to suddenly shift priorities to save her, while also ensuring enemies don't carry her away by taking them out. While the original game made it very easy (comically so, at times) to trivialize this aspect of gameplay by ordering Ashley to hide in garbage cans while you dealt with crowds of foes, this time around, hiding spots are few and far between. That's a welcome change, as it makes protecting her much more ingrained into combat, while avoiding the feeling that she's just an object you have to keep safe, which often came off as dehumanizing in the original.Like Leon, Ashley Graham is more fleshed-out and believable. She retains that 20-year-old sensibility and reacts as such, screaming in horror and shock at the sight of a parasite erupting from a cultist's head, but it's never overstated. Resident Evil 4 has struck a nice balance of allowing Leon and Ashley to communicate from time to time without overstaying its welcome and falling into the protagonist-who-talks-too-much trend that has become prevalent in games in recent years. Instead, they'll check in on one another after fights to ask if they're doing alright. Ashley will compliment Leon with a, ""Wow, that was a nice shot"" after you pop the head of a cultist with a sniper rifle. There are little extra added conversations that allow the friendship between them to develop, but it never distracts from the core of the gameplay or undermines the tension of the game.Across the board, characters are no longer the one-note plot devices they were in the original. Luis Serra, for example, is given a little extra screen time that better establishes his stakes in the overarching plot. And don't worry: Like Leon, his suave charm and ""hey, gotta smoke"" quips remain intact. He's still a leather jacket-wearing lady killer who slings one-liners and wields pistols like he's a cowboy out of a spaghetti western. Even Krauser, the '80s action movie archetypal antagonist who seemed to walk right out of movies like Commando, feels more well-rounded thanks to further context around his stakes and presence in the narrative.Some characters, however, have been given more flavor than depth--specifically the Merchant. His iconic voice has changed, but this is a new version of the Merchant who is iconic in his own right and stands as one of the most memorable characters in the franchise, despite only being a walking and talking pawn shop. He remains a mysterious figure you'll find throughout the world, but now with a few extra lines in his arsenal that you'll be saying as much as you said, ""What're ya buyin'?""--I've been repeating, ""Remember, fun rhymes with gun for a reason!"" to myself non-stop.When you're not covering yourself ""with the stench of battle,"" as the Merchant likes to say, you'll have the opportunity to go off the beaten path to track down treasure, as well as complete requests that the Merchant has placed around the environment for you to find. Some are scavenger hunts like finding a gold chicken egg, while others entail hunting down fiercer and more unruly enemies that require a little backtracking to get to. In exchange for completing these requests, you'll receive spinel gems that you can trade for treasure maps, special item upgrades, and more resources.The requests create more incentive to explore the world but never interrupt the flow and pacing of the game, as they often lead you back down familiar paths with newly gained items like special keys to unlock cabinets and devices that hold treasure. These side missions don't feel like chores or checklists to complete, as the requests are naturally paced along with the game's narrative and given a little story flavor to ground them in the world. I welcomed them, as they only prolonged my chance to wander around in a world I love spending time in, even if that meant trudging through decrepit villages or the fog-covered floors of a gothic horror castle again.Even as Leon's mission takes him to some of the less visually interesting areas in the latter chapters of the game (a carryover from the original Resident Evil 4), the remake still manages to retain a remarkable balance of bombastic action intensity and nail-biting combat scenarios. Where the original game started to lose its steam, the remake manages to keep the experience on track by considerably changing what I had come to know so well from the original. Some sections of the original game have been honed, trimmed down, and reorganized to fit better into the flow and also within the environment. The first encounter with the blind, giant-blade-wielding Garrador, for example, has been better contextualized to fit in the torturous depths of the castle. As a result, the scene is even scarier and more stressful than before--it all feels turned up to 11.There are also returning boss fights, some of which are slightly tweaked, while others have received a welcome, more significant overhaul. For nearly all of them, I had a smile plastered across my face despite the dozens of times I've faced them in the past. I applauded when I was caught off-guard by new additions and audibly cheered when I found some of Leon's most iconic lines were still in the game alongside new ones I'll be repeating for years to come. There's a remarkably judicious approach to respecting what Resident Evil 4 was by preserving vital elements of the original, and realizing the potential of what it can be by introducing new ones.On the other hand, some sections have been cut entirely, but it is evident that this has been done with careful consideration and a deft touch. For everything taken out of the game, something new has been introduced to take its place. Capcom has clearly paid close attention to how these decisions impact Resident Evil 4's masterful pacing, and the delicate balance of combat, exploration, and some additional puzzle-solving that's light and approachable.Writing this review has involved putting the controller down and stepping away from playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and as hyperbolic as it sounds, that is much easier said than done. At the time of writing, I have finished the campaign, started a New Game+ on Hardcore, and also begun an additional playthrough on Professional mode, and I know this is only the beginning of many more playthroughs to come.Resident Evil 4 remake is the re-envisioning I wanted, but also not the one I expected to get. As a Resident Evil 4 purist, I feared that messing with the magic of an all-time classic would spell disaster. Instead, the Resident Evil 4 remake deviates from the original in many significant ways, but never compromises anything that made it revolutionary. It preserves that, recontextualizes it, and rejuvenates it in a game that is designed to keep veteran players constantly on edge, toying with what they remember to create fear through subversion. Although I have an intimate knowledge of the original game, the slight tweaks and unexpected additions kept me from ever reaching a comfort zone--I was never fully at ease, even with my knowledge of the original game. Capcom's strategy of using my knowledge of the original against me was a huge success. I won't not go into details, and some of these moments are more subtle than others, but every one of them felt clever and considered.Capcom has masterfully created a new version of a beloved game and continues to blaze a trail with its Resident Evil remakes. Like the Resident Evil 2 remake before it, the studio has used advancements in technology and design to modernize an iconic survival-horror and action game by placing emphasis on capturing the spirit of the original, and respectfully evoking the same sense of atmosphere and tone that the original developers aspired to. At the same time, it empowers the player with thrilling new mechanics and places challenges in their way to test their mastery of them. In that respect, the remake stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:How many more does Capcom have left?In 2001, four years before the original Resident Evil 4 was released, Capcom knew it had a problem. The Resident Evil series was stuck in a cookie-cutter mold, producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi said at the time. “The whole concept of RE4 was to reinvent the game,” he said. “We wanted to give the gamers something new.”The result was a combat-forward reboot of the series that reconsidered its survival-horror roots, pitching Resident Evil 2 co-star Leon S. Kennedy as an international action hero on a mission to save the U.S. president’s daughter from a cult. Resident Evil 4 was hailed as a masterpiece, injecting new life into a franchise that would only become even more action-focused in ensuing sequels — ultimately prompting yet another reinvention of the series with the back-to-basics horror game Resident Evil 7 Biohazard.Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4 reimagines the series’ most beloved and influential entry with lavish detail, modernizing the game from top to bottom. Developers have reframed Leon’s adventure through the lens of other recent Resident Evil remakes, bringing new levels of beauty and squishy gore to Resident Evil 4 while also updating its controls and story. The result is a clear demonstration that the developers understand their source material, and want to make it sing by fleshing out every possible detail.The game also strongly signals that Resident Evil may be in need of a reinvention once again.Resident Evil 4’s core elements are present in the remake. Leon S. Kennedy, now a dashing government agent, is dispatched on a covert solo mission to Spain, where he searches for a target codenamed “Baby Eagle” — real name Ashley Graham, the daughter of U.S. President Graham. A group of cultists has kidnapped her in a plot to infect her with a parasite and ultimately make her their puppet. As Leon searches for Ashley, he encounters a remote rural village overrun by the parasite. Its angry residents — and a series of ultra-powerful men and monsters — stand between Leon and his rescuee.Leon is no longer the rookie cop of his previous game, and he no longer faces danger in the form of one or two shambling zombies at a time. Instead, he is well armed and combat-ready, and faces swarms of armed, infected humans known as Ganados. While resource management and ammunition scarcity were core to the gameplay of early Resident Evil games, in Resident Evil 4, players concern themselves more with crowd control and — specifically in the remake — parrying attacks from all sides. Resident Evil 4 presents a new type of challenge: surviving against overwhelming odds.In the remake, the dance to avoid death can be daunting. Ganados and burly men wielding chainsaws or giant hammers can quickly surround Leon. But Leon can parry or dodge just about any attack. He can roundhouse-kick or suplex bad guys, before finishing them off with a knife through the skull. Or he can approach encounters with stealth, creeping up behind unsuspecting enemies and dispatching them with a quiet execution. All these options make every combat encounter exciting and flexible in their demands; occasionally, they can be frustrating, as the game pours waves of enemies on Leon in set-pieces that feel more like an exercise in trial and error than puzzling out a solution.As in the original, Leon must also protect Ashley from harm in multiple, albeit brief, segments where the two team up. Ashley is totally vulnerable in these moments, and Leon must not only fight for his own survival, but hers as well. This time, she’s a far less complicated babysitting assignment; her health system has been greatly simplified. Ashley’s presence was a famously divisive element of the original, but she’s less of a nuisance here, and can be commanded to stay close to Leon (during chase sequences) or to keep her distance (during combat). The two work well together, and it’s fun to watch them flirt.In between Resident Evil 4’s action-heavy set-pieces is a series of puzzles, many of them inscrutable and ornate in the classic Resident Evil style, along with fetch quests. These lock-and-key tricks still take a back seat to the combat, and after all this time, they still feel perfunctory in the grand scheme of the game’s design. Even the puzzles specific to the remake feel like an afterthought on the developers’ part. Players will probably spend more time puzzling out how best to equip Leon, as a mystical, ever-present merchant offers a huge array of upgrades, weapons, armor, repairs, and recipes for Leon to purchase. (The Merchant quips, as fans would demand him to, “What are ya buyin’?” but only sometimes, in a great and rare display of restraint from the designers.) Capcom has added a new layer to Leon’s upgrades in the remake, letting him not only increase the size of the attaché case that stores his items, but also the case itself, with variants that offer varying perks, and attachable charms that offer even more buffs. Players can earn these charms at the shooting range minigame, an amusing, highly replayable diversion that appears at several locations in the game — I lost far too much time there trying to unlock the best charms, which are based on RNG.Resident Evil 4 also diverges from past games in its linearity. There’s very little backtracking to do here, as the game aggressively pushes Leon forward to new areas and new scenarios. While the same sequence of events is intact from the original, the overall flow and momentum have been both shaken up and smoothed out. Where Capcom has cut, wisely, is in eliminating or reframing the sillier components of the original game. Quick-time events from the original, where Leon would have to outrun boulders or an out-of-place mechanized giant statue, only to potentially fail in a matter of milliseconds before doing it all over again, have been recontextualized. The most striking and welcome example is how Capcom recast the central character of Ramón Salazar, who comes across less like a bleached Chucky doll and more like a distinguished but decaying old man. For all of the rough edges that it smooths over, Resident Evil 4 pulls off the same trick that Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 2 did in 2019, making a groundbreaking but now dated game feel brand new again. But after four Resident Evil games in as many years, even the current incarnations of the franchise are starting to feel a bit familiar — there are hints of the cookie-cutter mold that Kobayashi set out to shrug off more than 20 years ago, even in Capcom’s slick and gorgeously produced remakes. This latest one is no anomaly.Resident Evil 7 Biohazard and Village showed, just like the original RE4, that Capcom can adapt and reinvent. After completing 4 once again, the most obvious question the remake left me with was: Where do they go from here? Resident Evil 4 will be available on March 24 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” PlayStation 5 download code provided by Capcom.

Kotaku,"Resident Evil 4 remake—a complete reimaging of the classic 2005 survival horror game out now on consoles and PC—follows Capcom’s previous Resident Evil refreshes. Following the somewhat standalone Resident Evil 1 remake, we got the excellent Resident Evil 2 remaster. After that, we got the good if a bit short remaster of Resident Evil 3. And while fans may have wanted Capcom to remake Code Veronica next (and I still hope they do…), most assumed the publisher would hear the siren’s call and once more return to Resident Evil 4. It’s a game Capcom has re-released over and over again. I was, admittedly, nervous about it. After Capcom’s previous remasters, HD ports, and a VR version, did we really need a remake of such a great game? Would it even be worth it? Well, I’m glad Capcom ignored me and other fans and made the RE4 remake, a game that is better than the original.Remaking this beloved Resident Evil installment would be different that Capcom’s past projects. Unlike RE2 and 3, RE4 wasn’t a slow horror game with tank controls and static camera angles. It was the entry in the series where Capcom ditched all that and added more action and shooting into the formula, complete with a now-famous (and often imitated) over-the-shoulder camera. So the room for modernization was narrower, and the places where Capcom could “improve” the game were less obvious.So instead of tossing it all out or slavishly sticking to the original, the developers smartly pruned and tweaked it, as if the game was a delicate plant that could topple over if fucked with too much.At its core, this is still the same basic game. You still play as handsome good guy Leon S. Kennedy, a few years removed from that terrible night in Raccoon City. In the time since RE2, he’s become a badass federal agent and is sent on a mission to save the President’s daughter, who has been kidnapped by some creepy cult in the middle of rural Europe. Once Leon arrives and starts blasting and kicking his way across the area, he uncovers a disturbing secret, involving dangerous parasites and religious zealots. Veterans of the OG RE4 can confirm none of that has changed. Even the campy tones and cheesy dialogue—like Leon yelling out one-liners before killing bosses—mostly remains intact.It’s in the details and execution where Capcom has tweaked and edited the narrative and overall game. Some boss fights are missing, replaced either with new ones or just left off the table entirely in an effort to keep the story moving. Ashley is still a young woman, with a similar outfit, but you no longer can look up her skirt, and characters aren’t constantly hitting on her in uncomfortable ways. Leon can now move, aim and shoot at the same time. Oh, and QTEs are gone from cutscenes!Added up, all of these tiny tweaks and changes do make the game feel noticeably different than the original. This is a faster, more aggressive, and more modern-feeling Resident Evil 4. My first few hours were spent being knocked around a ton while getting cornered by large groups of enemies. Yet, I didn’t mind this at all. In fact, modern improvements to controls make it easier to fight big waves of baddies. And all of this—including the way the remake better handles its characters and narrative—felt like they were implemented by people who really, really cared about this shit.This is more noticeable in the ways Resident Evil 4’s remake doesn’t change things up. There’s still a mysterious merchant who will sell you various upgrades and weapons and buy your unwanted items, though you can no longer kill him. The opening village fight remains an intense baptism by fire. The Regeneradors in the latter sections of the game are still scary as hell. You can shoot crows to get coins like it’s 2005. You can once again abuse Leon’s massive kicks when attacking a stunned enemy. And if you shoot the lake, you’ll still get your ass eaten by the giant monster hiding below the murky surface.It’s clear the devs knew what could be tweaked, removed, or heavily altered and what needed to remain. It’s a balancing act that seems unbelievably hard to pull off, and yet throughout the entire 16 hours or so it took me to beat my first RE4 remake playthrough, I never stopped and shook my head over some tweaked mechanic or missing piece of content.The worst European vacation ever. Action-Packed Survival HorrorFantastic visuals, smart changes to the original game, faster and harder, the attache caseNo Separate Ways campaign, Mercs mode missing at launchCapcomMarch 23, 2023Completed main story in 17 hours and replayed first few hours in New Game+PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (Played), PCWell, that’s not completely true. When I discovered the Ada Wong-focused side campaign “Separate Ways” wasn’t part of this remaster, I did get sad. But thankfully, it seems Capcom may have plans to add that side adventure in the future. Similarly, The Mercenaries mode is absent at launch but will be added via a free update on April 7.Still, even with that stuff missing out of the gate, the RE4 remake feels like a complete package. The kind of game we don’t get anymore. After beating the game once, you’ll unlock fun extras and new costumes. Beat it again on a harder difficulty or with a faster time and you’ll unlock more powerful weapons and cheats. All of that wonderful stuff is here and just like in the original game, it makes RE4 remake hard to put down and easy to get lost in. I literally started up a second playthrough via New Game+ the moment the credits ended.If it wasn’t clear before, this isn’t a 1:1 recreation of Resident Evil 4. This game is a bit darker, a bit faster, and easier to control. It cuts some bosses and annoying parts but has also expanded on fan favorites, like the attache case inventory system and merchant-ran shooting galleries. (The shooting galleries are more elaborate now and the case can be modified, granting bonuses and perks.)Really, instead of recreating the classic title, Capcom has instead seemingly dug into my brain and pulled out the version of the game I remember playing in 2005 and slapped that onto a disc to sell back to me. Crafty bastards, I’ll give them that.I didn’t think we needed a Resident Evil 4 remake. I guessed that Resident Evil 4’s remake would look nice and play well, just as the other recent remakes. But what I didn’t expect was a game that not only recreates the original but also builds on it in smart and interesting ways to create something different and better than the classic.In fact, when I go back and replay Resident Evil 4 again one day in the not-too-distant future, I think it will be this new version that I’ll return to instead of the original. And I truly can’t think of higher praise to lay upon the remake than that. "

Ever since the 2002 update to the original Resident Evil, Capcom has been the standard-bearer when it comes to re-examining a classic. It featured more than enough new content for series veterans, but also stood as an excellent modern entry point for newcomers. Almost 20 years later, Capcom would repeat this formula with the stellar Resident Evil 2 remake and the more forgettable remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.It’s natural to wonder when Capcom would put the brakes on this lucrative remake train. Do they go all the way up to the maligned Resident Evil 6 with its bloated campaigns and uneven action? Or do they even bother with Resident Evil 5, with its heavily criticized setting and somewhat disappointing campaign?I even wondered if they’d bother to remake Resident Evil 4. After all, it’s already one of the most re-released games this side of Skyrim. I loved my time with the GameCube original at launch, as well as the PS2 version with its added Ada Wong content, the Wii version complete with motion controls, re-releases on Switch and several generations of PlayStation, and even in VR. It’s arguably the entry least in need of an upgrade even in terms of gameplay. The campaign may be loaded with hot-at-the-time QTEs and the visuals are a bit dated, but it’s still a blast to play and was never saddled with the clunky tank controls of old.If you wondered if Resident Evil 4 could benefit from the big-budget Capcom remake machine, the answer is an emphatic “yes.” Like the remakes of 1 and 2, it is fully in line with the white-knuckled spirit of the original release while brilliantly subverting expectations and tightening up every element of the experience. Some remakes are all about making the visuals of the original look more palatable to modern audiences. In Resident Evil 4, the (admittedly stunning) graphical upgrade is the least interesting part of the package.Let’s start with what’s the same. Resident Evil 4 was always a three-act story – Leon makes his way through a nightmarish village in rural Spain before exploring a sprawling castle and winding up on an island filled with parasite-controlled, assault rifle-toting soldiers. That has not changed. You’ll still be sprinting away from the chainsaw man in the village, escorting Ashley (the President of the United States’ daughter) through the castle, trading barbs with everyone’s favorite Little Lord Boy, and getting into a knife fight with a reject from the cast of Apocalypse Now.Some areas are largely unchanged. The opening village is still a mad scramble through barns and houses until the church bell rings. In the castle’s water room you’ll still feel overwhelmed as monks attempt to drag Ashley to her doom. If you disliked the original’s swing towards action in the latter act on the island, you’ll probably still consider it the weakest part of the campaign.Most of the frustrating aspects of the original have been shortened, changed, or omitted entirely. Even the action-heavy island is improved with the addition of stealth takedowns, either via sneaking up on enemies and stabbing them in the neck or taking them out from afar with the silent bolt thrower. I have annoying memories of stumbling through dark and flooded sewers, flipping stupid switches during late-game boss fights, and getting run over by a boulder because I didn’t anticipate a QTE prompt. These frustrations were drastically minimized or completely absent this time around.As much as I appreciate the omission of the negative elements of the original, I had even more appreciation for all of the smart changes and additions this remake introduces. Ashley seems to require far less babysitting and now you don’t even need to manage her health. You’ll never have to decide whether Leon or Ashley gets that coveted yellow herb – Leon can scarf down (or whatever he does) every one of them guilt-free now. When Ashley takes too much damage, she’ll go into a state where you have to help her up before she gets attacked again. That’s it. When I played the original, I was haunted by her screaming out for Leon and me having to repeatedly restart checkpoints. During this playthrough, I think she caused me to restart twice.That’s not to say this experience is easier. It’s every bit a scramble to survive during sections like the village, the attack at the house, the castle’s water room, and large chunks of the island. My first playthrough saw Leon die 29 times despite my long history with the game. If you think you know the original too well to be surprised or challenged, know that you can look forward to numerous moments that will catch you entirely off guard. I don’t want to spoil any of these in particular, but there were several times where I yelled “OH MY GOD” at my television in the middle of the night. This game is going to fucking kill people when that VR mode gets released.Capcom took out a bunch of the frustrating elements, added a ton of excellent and surprising new stuff, and I still don’t have enough words to go over all of the little tweaks and additions that I appreciated. Parrying feels incredible every time, whether you’re swatting an axe out of mid-air or stopping a chainsaw blade from lopping your head off. The shooting gallery is expanded upon and offers useful charms for those with good aim. Spinels are no longer random shiny objects in the environment, as they’re now rewards for merchant quests that can be spent on exclusive upgrades and items. Journal entries expand upon memorable boss fights like El Gigante and The Garrador. Even something as simple as slotting gems into treasures has added a fun color-based multiplier system to maximize your sell value.On top of it all, it manages to maintain the perfect amount of cornball and ridiculous moments. Leon hasn’t grown out of his one-liners and he’s still throwing German suplexes like he’s the Brock Lesnar of rural Spain.I don’t know what more you could ask for in this stunning remake of Resident Evil 4. It’s obvious to say that a great remake should satisfy both returning fans and total newcomers, but this goes so far beyond that. The original game is one of my favorites of all time and now the only reason I’d recommend anyone play it is purely for historical value. And if you’re a complete newcomer to the series, this is bar none one of the most thrilling games ever. It shines as the ultimate Resident Evil experience and the greatest remake of all time.© 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Destructoid,"darkThe impact that Resident Evil 4 had on the industry can’t be overstated. Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it’s an important and well-loved title.When the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market. Now I know the answer.Resident Evil 4 (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox Series X|S) Developer: Capcom Publisher: Capcom Release: March 24, 2023 MSRP: $59.99Six years after the worst first day on the job ever, Leon “Sherbert” Kennedy has an awesome jacket. Now working a different job, he has that jacket taken from him, and spends the entirety of the game trying to get it back. Also, the President of the United States’ daughter is missing in the area. Maybe find her and ask if she’s seen his jacket.Leon’s jacket is lost somewhere in a remote part of Spain. Crawling across the countryside are angry people who have worms.Resident Evil 4 can be neatly sliced into three parts: the village, the castle, and the island. The first part was a major departure for the series, simply due to it being more rural and not including zombies. Zombies don’t really pop up at all in a direct interpretation of the word; instead, having you fight faster, smarter enemies that come in various flavors. So, while the locations of the latter two parts of the game are more familiar in terms of Resident Evil aesthetics, the enemies and change of control style makes it feel like a largely different game throughout.In a lot of ways, Resident Evil 4 was a necessary evolution of the series, as things were starting to grow a bit stale. However, this also means that a remake is less impactful than what we saw with the recent refurbishments of Resident Evil 2 and 3. It could be argued that Resident Evil 4 didn’t need a remake, and now that it’s here, that remains absolutely true.The most appreciable difference in Resident Evil 4’s refresh is the graphics. It is, to my untrained eye, a top-to-bottom redo. However, beyond that, this will be extremely familiar to anyone who played the 2005 original version. Those three parts I mentioned above are still as starkly partitioned. Leon still loses his jacket and fights Napoleon. You can still take all the villagers and cultists on a scenic vacation to suplex city. If you haven’t played Resident Evil 4 in over 15 years, then you could potentially be tricked into believing this is just a visual upgrade. Even the behavior of the villagers was so familiar to me that I could almost take them down through muscle memory alone.There is a tremendous list of omissions and additions made here too exhaustive for the contents of this review. However, I feel like I must stress that this is still entirely Resident Evil 4. It may look prettier, and you can move when you shoot, but thematically and mechanically, it’s more similar than dissimilar. It tries to land in a sweet spot of addressing past complaints and modernizing while retaining what people loved about Resident Evil 4. I can’t speak for anyone but myself, but I feel like they did pretty well on hitting that target.This also means that certain things that might not be to people’s tastes are also often changed. Dialogue is redone, but Leon “Sicknasty” Kennedy still spouts ridiculous one-liners. The main antagonists have all returned, and they’re all still as shockingly out-of-place as they were before. I know there was some concern that Capcom would play it too straight with Resident Evil 4, but with a few exceptions, it’s just as atonal as it was originally. For better or worse.The greatest thing about Resident Evil 4 is that it’s fun. Whether you can move while aiming or not, the combat is reactive and enjoyable. Enemies are a nice mixture of varied and dumb, and there’s a bit of randomness that comes in when certain enemies take more shots or sometimes get back up after you kill them. You can shoot their legs to set them up for a suplex or wait for them to get close and parry them. My favorite is to lead them all into a big cluster and drop a grenade by their feet, especially when the president’s daughter is in the mosh-pit with them.There’s a nice layer of progression spread over top, as well. You gradually get access to buy new weapons, can upgrade your favorites, and customize your kit as you see fit. Leon’s nimble fingers can also craft in the midst of battle, so there are plenty of strategies that come into play.The biggest issue in all this is that it’s very front-loaded. The best section of the game is when you first enter the village, and it never reaches that height again. That’s not to say it doesn’t remain to be a fun time, but I just can’t believe they didn’t put together more complex set-pieces like that.Speaking of which, Resident Evil 4 also has a dizzying amount of variety and is constantly throwing new stuff at you. When I say “new,” I mean it was new in 2005. There isn’t a lot here that’s going to surprise you if you’re familiar with its original state. They got rid of the quick-time events, which makes that whole deal with Jack Krauser a bit more tolerable, but there’s something else there in its place. They’ve also dropped in some new varieties of enemies, but they’re not very meaningful additions. On the other hand, they blend in so well with the original cast that you’d be forgiven for not even realizing they’re new.A lot of people will be happy to hear that Ashley is less annoying. I didn’t find her too awful in the original version, but she was so much easier to ignore this time around.One thing to note is that a lot of side content isn’t even implemented yet. I was surprised, upon completing Resident Evil 4, that the Mercenaries mode doesn’t exist. Capcom has said that this will be coming in a post-release patch. What they haven’t clarified is where all the Ada Wong content is. The “Separate Ways” sub-story that was added in the PS2 version isn’t here. I have a creeping suspicion that it will be paid DLC, but since they haven’t said anything, that’s just speculation.Resident Evil 4 was a groundbreaking title that shifted the direction of big-budget development. The over-the-shoulder camera angle employed was tremendously influential for years to come. It also shifted the Resident Evil series into its worst era, as Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6 both followed its example before Capcom eventually corrected its course.Back in 2005, I liked Resident Evil 4, but I didn’t love it. The remake hasn’t changed that. Unlike the Resident Evil 2 remake, which was revolutionary, Resident Evil 4’s glow-up is more of a faithful recreation rather than an overhaul. It changes just enough that, if you loved the original, I can’t guarantee this will leave you unperturbed. Meanwhile, if you didn’t like its first iteration, it’s not impossible that this will change your mind. The best I can say is that it is an earnest effort at recapturing the magic, and it’s worth checking out. It remains, as it always was, maddeningly inconsistent.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.

With the RE2 and RE3 remakes in the bag, Capcom is now on to the Resident Evil 4 remake. RE4 was the entry that took the series in an interesting new direction, with an over-the-shoulder camera and heavier focus on the action. It was a bold risk that paid off with a huge boost in mainstream appeal and critical acclaim. However, this evolution cost Resident Evil much of its horror game soul, which was sent further out of balance with RE5 and RE6.With the best Resident Evil games, the action gameplay is masterfully balanced with horror elements, but it’s a tough feat. This makes the Resident Evil 4 remake all the more impressive, as Capcom has delivered everything that made the original so revolutionary and so much more.Right from the get-go it’s clear that this is a massively overhauled experience. Even veterans like myself, who have replayed RE4 over and over will be surprised at how different the opening is. More time is spent developing the police escorting Leon and their fates are all the more gruesome, setting the scene for a remake that aims to inject a healthy dose of horror into Leon’s previously campy adventure. Sure, he still spouts one-liners, but these moments of levity are a lot less jarring, often complementing the incredulity felt by the player in moments of absolute chaos and scenes of gratuitous gore.The expansion of the intro teases the additional content found in the rest of the game, with areas made larger and more complex. There are many additional puzzles and plenty of extra loot to find. This leads to a surprising boost in play time, with my expected 14-hour playthrough turning into 20 hours. What’s more, the grading system, unlockable costumes and weapons, and harder difficulties invite at least one replay. While the story still hits the same beats, with Leon forcing his way through a secluded Spanish village to rescue the U.S. president’s daughter, Capcom has given the cutscenes, environments, and enemies glow-ups in the most terrifying ways. In the original, it was easy to feel superpowered as Leon blasted his way through slow-moving villagers and cultists. In the remake, more cunning and aggressive enemies quickly swarm you out of the darkness and tougher minibosses appear at the most inconvenient moments, making it easy to feel overwhelmed. I died five times on Normal difficulty and the “You Are Dead” scenes are as brutal as ever, with Leon often losing his head. Leon is not helpless, however. While he was a newbie in Resident Evil 2, he has spent the last six years training as a specialist agent, skilled with weapons and hand-to-hand combat. This means he can throw a mean punch and land a big roundhouse kick, all the while headshotting enemies with a range of upgradeable weapons. Various difficulty and accessibility options, including a generous aim assist function, are also available to further personalize the level of challenge.Brand new to the Resident Evil 4 remake are the stealth mechanics. These are fairly basic, as the new crouch button quietens Leon’s movement and the knife attack provides a handy one-hit-kill from behind. I’ll admit that I was worried when the game first kicked me into a stealth tutorial, but it’s a minor element and purely optional. At first I was skeptical, but I became grateful for the ability to take down a couple of enemies before I was inevitably spotted by the remaining horde.Another new mechanic that initially had me worried is knife degradation. In the original, Leon’s knife did not break and was used to conserve ammo as he slashed open boxes and got in the occasional cheeky hit at close range. In the remake, knives can only last so long. It makes sense given how powerful it is now, with the new ability to parry attacks, one-hit-kill enemies, and deal significantly more damage with pokes and slashes, but I was still very thankful to learn that it is easily repairable. Like with stealth, I grew to ultimately appreciate the new knife functions.We need to talk about Ashley, the president’s daughter. Arguably the most polarizing element of the original Resident Evil 4, Ashley requires protecting through the bulk of the game. Just as players are getting used to controlling Leon and mastering his abilities, the game throws in a curveball with the vulnerable Ashley. On paper, it’s genius, as Ashley adds another layer of difficulty at the very moment when players are just getting comfortable, reintroducing the tension that had slowly been unwinding since the start of the game. However, the way enemies target her and try to either outright kill or carry her away, can make for some frustrating moments that are easy to criticize.With that said, having now completed the game, I can look back and say Ashley has been massively improved for the remake. Her character goes through some valuable development during the story and it feels like there’s more of a connection between her, Leon, and the other characters. Ashley is also easier to protect, as she no longer has a health bar to manage and Leon can stop her from being carried away with a quick knife attack.Sure, the game would be easier with just Leon, but easy is not the goal here. Instead, Capcom uses Ashley to force the player to think on their feet and adapt. She might still be a controversial element, but it would be dull without the extra dimension she brings.The Resident Evil 4 remake isn’t flawless. On PS5 there are graphics options for fancier hair and ray tracing, but I found that both of these settings caused the frame rate to drop below 60 FPS and introduce a noticeable stutter. With those settings disabled, however, the game remains impressively smooth in frame rate mode, despite the incredible visuals. I’m also not a fan of the repetitive enemy designs. I killed the same male villager in the exact same clothes a good 30 times. It would have been nice to see more variety there, especially in a “remake” where extreme attention to detail and maximum polish is expected. Fans of the original will also be sad to learn that there is no “Separate Ways” content, meaning you won’t get to play through key moments of the story as Ada Wong. Perhaps it will roll out as a DLC in the future, like the score attack Mercenaries mode that has been promised for shortly after launch. Without these modes, the remake feels less definitive than I was expecting, though the expanded main game content helps to make up for it.Finally, while some of the boss fights have been overwhelmingly improved, others pale by comparison and left me asking “Is that it?” For the most part, though, the main bosses and minibosses are great and made to feel a lot more threatening. The Resident Evil 4 remake keeps what made the original so good while significantly elevating the story with horror elements, the presentation with cutting-edge visuals and performance, and the gameplay with many welcome quality-of-life improvements. While there are some small niggles that I would have loved to see perfected, this remake exceeds expectations, perfectly balancing the action with the horror and cementing Resident Evil 4 as my favorite game in the series.9Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowThe Resident Evil 4 remake had the challenge of improving upon one of the greatest games of all time. Does it cut the mustard or is this chainsaw missing some teeth?Like many others, I was waiting for the Resident Evil 4 remake with high hopes and a bit of nervousness. Resident Evil 4 is a beast all its own compared to other mainline franchise entries. It was a turning point in the Resident Evil franchise and a keystone in the design of every third-person action game that followed. So, how do you improve on a masterpiece? I wouldn’t know where to begin. Capcom does, though. It also knows where to continue and where to end, taking what was considered an already impeccable game by many and moving the pieces just enough to make it an even more brilliant picture.If you somehow missed out on Resident Evil 4’s various forms since 2005, get ready for a trip. This one takes place a few years after the events of Resident Evil 2. Former Raccoon City rookie cop Leon Kennedy came out of the worst first day on the job in history to become a special agent for the US government. Unfortunately, the President’s daughter, Ashley Graham, was kidnapped and Leon’s the guy tasked with saving her. That takes him to a remote Spanish village, and it isn’t long before you’re pulled into the heart of a biological weapon-fueled cult as Leon races against time to save Ashley’s life.The original Resident Evil 4 was scary, but it also had the beats of a cheesy action flick. As Leon fought enemies, secured Ashley, and interacted with other main characters like femme fatale Ada Wong and enigmatic ladies’ man Luis Sera, there were quips a-plenty and always a sense of confident bluster about it. The beauty of it has always been that no matter how good Leon is, the threats in Resident Evil 4 are intense enough to challenge him and keep the player on their toes.I’m happy to share that a lot of that stayed intact here, and was even improved. Leon is still quippy and even has some new one-liners that will probably become favorites among fans. Meanwhile, I think many will agree that Ashley was often a chore in the original game that mostly just stood aside unless she needed to be saved. In the remake, she grows and becomes more meaningful, becoming stronger and more supportive of Leon as the story goes on. Where she begins scared and confused, later on, she comes to terms, cheers Leon on, and even enthusiastically helps him in key moments. Luis was also a favorite of mine, taking on a whole new dimension through both overt and subtle changes. Even the villains have been given effective depth. All of this happens without shedding much, if any, of their original beats, and I’d argue what was shed was either necessary or inconsequential in comparison to what was added.I was shocked at how well the Resident Evil 4 remake constantly subverted my expectations. Yes, most of the main narrative points and broad outcomes are similar, but the journey between those beats moved constantly between gentle differences and massive shifts that I ultimately felt were for the better. Take Krauser for instance. The soldier turned renegade mercenary was always a weak point of the original defined mostly by an annoying quick-time event (QTE) knife fight and a somewhat obnoxious, but still intense boss battle. If you’ve seen the reveals on Resident Evil 4, then you already know the knife fight was made into a proper player-controlled battle, but it’s more than that. That fight is good and Capcom uses it to flesh out the stories of a lot of characters as the battle carries on.All of this to say that Resident Evil 4 moved as I predicted in the broad strokes, but it did it in ways that made more sense. The sheer amount of remixed details constantly caught me off guard and delighted me. It made for a better, scarier Resident Evil 4 and an overall more satisfying package filled corner to corner with Easter eggs and deeper lore that are sure to delight fans of the series. Of course, not every single moment is drastically improved, but nothing falls short of the original. At worst, the lesser scenes just stay on par.Of course, none of that story would matter if Resident Evil 4’s gameplay wasn’t also up to snuff. The core gameplay is still mostly intact. Leon has a grid-based attaché case that he can fill with weapons, curatives, and gadgets. As deranged cultists come at him, you will likely employ a lot of it fighting them off. I will say right off the bat that one of my pain points with the game is the aim. Where the original had a laser pointer on every weapon, that’s removed here. Every gun has new aiming mechanics more in line with the previous Resident Evil remakes, with weapon sway and bonus accuracy for staying still and steady.This is tough when you’re constantly surrounded by enemies. Early in Resident Evil 4, you may find yourself overwhelmed by panic as you try to land successful shots while avoiding being circled by foes looking to get a cheap hit in. However, I also felt it increased the tension right out of the gate. Hitting a critical shot on an enemy and busting their face open with a follow-up roundhouse kick feels more satisfying than ever. So do skull-popping headshots.It’s worth noting that if the aim really gets to you, you’ll find weapons and attachments that will make that problem easier to deal with. Furthermore, Resident Evil 4 has a plethora of accessibility options that includes Aim Assist. If there’s an aspect of the game that you’re having issues with visually or mechanically, the option to adjust and dial them into your liking can be found throughout this remake’s wide assortment of gameplay and accessibility toggles.The enemies in the remake get some new tricks to suit their numbers. Villagers that get behind Leon will actually try to hold him for other enemies to finish him off – absolutely terrifying when you’re turned around to see a chainsaw-wielding maniac approaching. Let him get in and it leads to one of the many revamped and brutal death scenes scattered throughout the game. Later on, further enemies are also full of new tricks and creepy little nuances that make them all the more intense.Leon has an incredible wealth of new toys and moves himself, with knives acting as a prominent star in this show. He has his own knife that can be repaired and upgraded at a merchant, but you’ll also collect lesser knives. It’s important because Leon can now parry attacks with it and negate damage. He can also break a grapple with a knife. The catch is each knife has a durability meter. Parrying and slashing uses a little durability while breaking grapples uses a lot. Being without a knife is a death sentence in some cases, so every decision made with them inside and outside of combat feels critical, and any time spent without them becomes all the more frightening.There are a bunch of new weapons in the Resident Evil 4 remake and even some twists on the ones you know. Almost every original gun is accounted for, offering a wide variety of options between power, ammo capacity, range, and speed of use. I was particularly drawn to a newcomer: the Bolt Thrower. Taking the place of the Mine Launcher, this crossbow is very fun. You can kill silently with it (stealth is a meaningful option in this game) and collect your ammo from a corpse or missed shot, making it valuable for preserving your resources. I loved this twist on a weapon I really didn’t care for in the original, but Resident Evil 4’s armory is still full of satisfying options that will let you customize your offense to your heart’s content. You can even craft ammo and resources with new items found throughout the game (including lesser knives) or take on small quests from merchants (expanded beyond shooting blue medallions in the original) that will help you unlock even more enhanced gear.A lot of the set piece action moments and encounters were also reworked and are mostly accounted for. I think the only one that stood out as less than the others was the lake fight. There’s something about the water of the lake in this remake that doesn’t look right. Leon’s boat stays mostly dry during the battle despite being thrown all over the place, and the waves in the lake do not look great compared to how gorgeous everything else in the game is. Even then, that encounter is hardly bad or unfun. The water just looks weirdly out of place among its otherwise gorgeous visuals.The only other qualm I had is that there are some really distinct graphical quirks I noticed. Most notable is that this game has very few loading screens and, when moving into new areas, I could sometimes see visual filters, brightness, and contrast notably change only after I moved in, especially in heavily contrasted areas such as coming out of dark caves into open space. It’s a transition that’s likely necessary to keep the action flowing smooth, but was also poorly hidden. Nonetheless, I still prefer Resident Evil 4 moving along so seamlessly and keeping me in the moment without loading.Every issue I had about Resident Evil 4 was minor and each one could either be adjusted or was simply buried under the sheer amount of great content. This remake is intense and scary. It’s no cakewalk, but can be softened to suit you. The story is not only refreshed, but improved, and the shifts and added details will likely delight fans of this series as much as they delighted me. Moreover, New Game+ and all sorts of other unlockables after the credits mean we’ll all be likely playing through this one over and over again.Capcom had a mountain of a task remaking Resident Evil 4. The original changed everything and set a benchmark for the series that is still celebrated 18 years later. Nonetheless, I say this without reservations: Resident Evil 4 remake improves upon a masterpiece in ways that will make it hard to go back to the original. It might very well be the most perfect horror-action game I’ve ever played.This review is based on an early PlayStation 5 digital copy supplied by the publisher.

					TJ Denzer posted a new article, Resident Evil 4 review: I'll buy it at a high price 
					History has been made here at Shacknews.				
					You clever bastard, TJ. That's a quality headline. I just played through the original RE4, and some aspects of it--particularly the narrative and casual misogyny--didn't age well. Really looking forward to playing through the remake! 				
					At some point I had to stop gushing in this review, but I will say EVERY critique David and I had of the original was addressed, including the misogyny. If anything, we were hyper conscious to see if they kept anything unfortunate.				
					That's so awesome to hear. I probably will not have time to play this in the next 4-5 months, but fuck me, if I ain't buying it ASAP when my schedule is less hectic. Squeeeeee! 				
					I've never played RE4I guess this is the way to do it? 				
					Ok, so PS5 or PC? I have a 3080 but PC ports lately have not inspired confidence in me. 				
					I’ve played on both for nearly two weeks. While they’re both great, I recommend PC. Tighter controls and lots more bells and whistles. Full PC impressions coming next week. :)				
					Awesome, thank you!!!Is the game cpu bottlenecked at all? I have a 3080, but only an 8700k.Is the visual different pretty significant PS5 vs PC maxed? 				
					Nope, you should be good to go. I played on two PCs. One, at the Shacknews office, is tricked out. My PC at home was pretty good circa 2020 when I bought it. Both delivered on performance at various settings. I noticed slight visual jank in the PS5 version, such as the fat, bright white raindrops that had the Internet in an uproar a few weeks ago. On both PCs, the raindrops looked like raindrops. Not distracting at all.				
					Excellent, thanks again! 				
					PS5, couch, giant OLED				
					this always come up, but it's not like it's impossible to have both.  i've got an hdmi / usb cable with a usb dongle running downstairs to my livingroom. with a bit of setup, i can wake my PC up from my couch and output to my C1. it's glorious. more work, but the fidelity bump and cheaper operational costs are worth it to me. 				
					I only said it because I know Milleh will play it on a 10 inch screen or something.				
					7-15.1!				
					[deleted]				
					Does the game let you save at any time? 				
					No, similar to other RE games, it keeps saving to typewriter checkpoints. However, I would add that they are generously places, plus unlike other games, this one’s story is cut into chapters and you can also save at every chapter’s conclusion. I never really ever felt like save opportunities were too spaced out.				
					Thanks! 				
					The save point music in RE games is always amazing. 				
					Perfect scores from multiple outlets. I guess I should buy this.
