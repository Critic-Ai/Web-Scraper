Eurogamer,"Biohazard warning.The Resident Evil 3 remake comes out just over a year after the Resident Evil 2 remake, which is particularly satisfying timing when you consider the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis came out just a year after Resident Evil 2, back in 1999. Resident Evil 3 launched just before the launch of the PlayStation 2 and a transition to the next-generation of consoles, and the Resident Evil 3 remake launches not long before the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X - another satisfying parallel. But unfortunately there is an unwelcome parallel: the Resident Evil 3 remake, like the original upon which it is based, is inferior to its predecessor.Don't get me wrong, when the Resident Evil 3 remake is good, it's fantastic. The remodelled Jill Valentine, if not inspired by Milla Jovovich then certainly developed with the Resident Evil movie star in mind, is a wonderful character. Her desperate attempt to escape Raccoon City with the relentless Nemesis monster on her back quickly turns into a save the city operation - she's likeable, determined and I couldn't help but root for her throughout.I was surprised to find myself rooting for Umbrella mercenary Carlos Oliveira, too - once I got over his spectacularly vibrant bouffant hair. Carlos comes across as, well, a bit of a dick when he saves Jill - early doors - from the clutches of Nemesis. But as the story progresses so does his character. In reworking Resident Evil 3's plot, Capcom has placed greater emphasis on Carlos, and you play as him in two extended portions of the game. Jill is of course the star of the show here, but Carlos benefits from the extra quality time - and his new hairdo, which I'm convinced has a life of its own.And it's worth pointing out just how fantastic Resident Evil 3 remake looks. There is an incredible level of detail throughout the game, which was built on the Resident Evil 2 remake tech. Capcom's lighting technicians are wizards, and I love how incidental objects make subtle noises when you are close, just to freak you out. A creaking gate, the crunch of glass under foot, the wind blowing papers around the downtown streets of Raccoon City - nighttime never looked so good.It's a shame, then, that the Resident Evil 3 remake is so fleeting. I finished my playthrough in just five-and-a-half hours, and I think it's worth unpacking why it felt even breezier than that. This is a more action-oriented game than the Resident Evil 2 remake, and while it does contain traditional horror sections, such as skulking through the creepy corridors of a hospital, you spend less time tiptoeing around corners and listening for thuds, and more time blasting beasts to smithereens. Zombies are less threatening because both Jill and Carlos have the dodges they had in the original Resident Evil 3, but if you time a dodge perfectly, you get a free counter-attack opportunity. Jill and Carlos both have access to serious firepower (Jill gets the shotgun pretty early and Carlos starts with an assault rifle), too. It's not long before Jill gets an assault rifle of her own and then the death-dealing grenade launcher. So, this remake ends up quite the inventory management game as you fuss over making sure you've enough room for your weapons and their ammo (the grenade launcher has four types of ammo). The true fear is you run out of ammo, not run into a rock hard enemy.Capcom has also made some curious decisions when it comes to the cutting room floor that make the plot pacey. You start in Jill's incredibly-detailed apartment before Nemesis starts his assault and forces you out into the city streets. You spend the first hour or two in downtown Raccoon City, running this way and that as you try to get a train working. Downtown Raccoon City is more open than the confines of Resident Evil 2's iconic police station, and while zombies are everywhere, there are plenty of environmental aids to use in your defense, such as exploding barrels and electric shock stuns. But while downtown is more open, its map is modestly sized. And while you can spend the backtracking time it takes to explore some of the shops and building interiors that were closed off in the original game, it's not long before you're on the train and, well, as you'd expect - and as you know if you played Resident Evil 3 on PSone - your escape does not go well at all.The return to the police station is a cool moment for anyone who played the Resident Evil 2 remake, as, timeline wise, you arrive before Leon turns up. Without spoiling things, Capcom has significantly re-jigged how this area plays out, from start to finish. But there are some clever nods to the Resident Evil 2 remake here - an explanation of some environmental damage and even enemies you'll remember from last year's game. I got a kick out of retreading old ground - even if I'd seen most of it before.My favourite area from Resident Evil 3 is the clocktower, its creepy gothic architecture and fun puzzles a wonderful change of pace following the carnage of downtown. The remake relegates this section to a boss fight, played out in the area outside the clocktower. I found this particularly disappointing, as it means the remake sort of hurtles forward into the next section of the game, which, as someone familiar with the events of the original, meant I knew I was coming up on the endgame. Raccoon Park and its Grave Digger boss aren't in the remake at all, another popular Resident Evil 3 location that failed to make the cut.Perhaps the bigger issue is the lack of puzzles. There are only a few to solve, and none involve much work. I love the silly puzzle-solving in the original Resident Evil games, and the Resident Evil 2 remake had plenty of that, too. What happened here? I'm not sure, but more puzzles would have added variety to the gameplay. Resident Evil 3 remake is a relatively straightforward adventure, and while you can spend time backtracking to find weapon attachments, extra resources and Easter eggs, progression is linear.Which brings me neatly onto Nemesis - Resident Evil 3's big bad. I won't spoil how or when he turns up, or his various forms (there are a few, and some of them are fantastically outlandish), but for me he's not as effective, or as memorable a villain as Resident Evil 2 remake's Mr X. He works best in downtown Raccoon City, where he stalks Jill in (relatively) humanoid form while wearing his creepy bin bag-style clothes. But his jump scares feel scripted. Sure, there is some sense of him dynamically stalking you once he bursts onto the scene - usually through a wall. But where Mr. X imposed a sense of dread that encompassed the entire police department - so much so that venturing out from a safe room gave me the fear - Nemesis is about inducing surprise panic.There are moments where this can work tremendously well. In one playthrough, on a harder difficulty, I escaped the clutches of Nemesis by the skin of my teeth (the less said about Nemesis' new teeth, the better). One more hit and I'd die, and with Nemesis leaping to attack, I made it under a shutter with a millisecond to spare. Safe, sweating, exhilarating! But these moments are by design, rather than emergent. And in any case, after Nemesis starts sprouting tentacles, he ditches his surprise stalker status and settles into a traditional boss fight role. It's a different feel, and I don't think it's better.A word on Resident Evil: ResistanceResident Evil: Resistance, the asymmetrical 4v1 multiplayer survival horror game, comes bundled with the Resident Evil 3 remake. It is a separate download and client, and was once an entirely separate project. We'll have more to say on it once its servers are live, but based on our time with the game during playtests and the beta, it's fun with friends but a bit of a nightmare with randoms. If you're playing as the Mastermind, know this: Mr. X is overpowered - as he should be?All this - the pacing, the progression, the action and Nemesis' design, contributes to the feeling the Resident Evil 3 remake is over too soon. I know, the original Resident Evil 3 wasn't exactly a long game. And Resident Evil 2's campaign can be completed in a handful of hours, too. But Resident Evil 2 remake's campaign can be played over with two separate characters, which changes things. Resident Evil 3 remake is one set story, divided up into Jill and Carlos playtime.So, why play it again once you've finished the game? There are a few reasons. There are incredibly hard difficulty sections for Resident Evil masochists. The knife is invulnerable, so knife-only runs are viable. When you finish the game you unlock the shop, which lets you buy a new costume for Jill and other game-affecting ""leg-ups"" for a virtual currency you obtain by completing in-game challenges. But apart from that, there's nothing much else to do.I feel like I'm coming down a little too hard on the Resident Evil 3 remake. After all, my expectations were set with the incredible Resident Evil 2 remake in mind. Jill is a triumphant character, and there are moments of genuine brilliance here. The hospital level, whose tone rekindles memories of Resident Evil 2's police department, is fantastically unnerving. But for every super cool area in the Resident Evil 3 remake, there are two areas that fail to inspire. Downtown Raccoon City is, unfortunately, not the expansive, multi-layered stalk-fest I'd hoped it would be. There are no alternate endings to chase, no story-altering choices to make, no new game plus mode. The source material is - and I think this is the perceived wisdom - simply not as good as the original Resident Evil 2. But I can't shake the feeling the Resident Evil 3 remake was rushed - as its original was. Now that's an unfortunate parallel.

Link Official siteWhen I first encountered the Nemesis in Resident Evil 3, a monstrous bio-weapon sent by the Umbrella Corporation to hunt and kill protagonist Jill Valentine, I felt my pulse rise. This towering stack of ugly muscle can move alarmingly fast, snag you with a pair of slimy tentacles, and even use weapons, including a colossal rocket launcher.You can outrun the Tyrant in the Resident Evil 2 remake fairly easily. Wait for a gap to open up, then slip through it. But running can't save you from the Nemesis, who stalks you relentlessly through the zombie-ravaged streets of Raccoon City, and always feels one step ahead of you. Seeing something that big and scary move so quickly is really unnerving.At this point I assumed Resident Evil 3 would be one long, tense game of cat and mouse against a dynamic and unpredictable enemy. But, sadly, this is far from the case. That first run-in with the Nemesis is not only more scripted than it first appears, but basically a one-off set-piece in disguise. And for the remainder of the game the creature is promptly relegated to cutscenes and pedestrian boss battles, which is deeply disappointing.Replay that first encounter and you'll notice that the Nemesis always appears in the same places at the same time, which swiftly shatters the illusion that this is an intelligent killing machine with a mind of its own. It feels like it's a step ahead of you because it literally is, set to spawn when you reach certain parts of the level. I wasn't expecting Alien: Isolation levels of reactive AI here, but at least something to chew on. It's frustratingly half-baked and so, unfortunately, is the rest of the game.The streets of Raccoon City have a very different feel from the claustrophobic corridors, polished floors, creepy statues, and grand hallways of Resident Evil 2's police station. There are a handful of larger, more open spaces here, connected by alleyways, apartment blocks, and sewer tunnels. The city is illuminated by an explosion of neon signs, which make it feel more like Las Vegas than small-town America, but it looks cool. I like that I occasionally find myself using the larger space to reposition zombies, luring them down one staircase to escape up another.The city is illuminated by an explosion of neon signs, which make it feel more like Las Vegas than small-town America.Raccoon City is a nice change of scenery, but it's short-lived. Later environments are dingy and artistically uninspired—particularly the Spencer Memorial Hospital, a location you visit towards the end of the game. Compared to the visually striking, architecturally rich RPD building, this maze of samey corridors and wards is totally forgettable. It's somehow less interesting to look at than the hospital in the original game.Speaking of which, this is a remake of Resident Evil 3 in the loosest sense. The plot, locations, and characters are vaguely similar, but it's a departure in so many other respects that it might as well be an entirely new game. Whole locations are missing, including the clock tower, even though its exterior features in a scene. And those sections where the action stops and you have to make story-altering decisions have been cut entirely.Resident Evil is best when you're lost in a complex, labyrinthine space, forced to make a mental map as you play, unlocking more of the sprawl by solving puzzles and finding keys. But Resident Evil 3 has none of this, and is actually stiflingly linear. You're frequently funnelled down a prescribed path to the next cutscene, and it doesn't help that the story is lean to the point of nonexistence, with one-dimensional characters and a narrative through-line so flimsy I kept forgetting what I was doing or why.I do like the way it connects to Resident Evil 2, though. The story takes place 24 hours before Leon and Claire arrive in Raccoon City, and you'll witness events that provide additional backstory to stuff you saw in the previous game—including how Marvin ended up bleeding all over the lobby of the police station. There are a few fun set-pieces in here too, including a fraught, chaotic siege straight out of a classic zombie movie, and a darkly hilarious homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark's boulder chase.Resident Evil 3 comes with a 4v1 multiplayer mode called Resistance, where a group of players are tormented by a player-controlled 'mastermind' who lays traps and other obstacles for them. We'll have more on this when the game goes live and the servers are populated.But man, what happened to the combat? One of the most surprising things about the Resident Evil 2 remake was how it made slow, shambling zombies exciting again. Its undead were brilliantly physical and clumsy, tripping over each other, tumbling down stairs, flopping into comical ragdoll heaps. But here they seem strangely disconnected from their surroundings, and shooting them just doesn't feel as satisfying. It's like the physics that govern them have been severely reduced, or removed altogether.They hardly react to the limp, rattly assault rifle (a new weapon), and even popping them with a pistol has less of the crunchy feedback that made Resident Evil 2's combat so enjoyable. At least the shotgun still packs a punch. This reduced fidelity may be a trade-off for having more zombies on screen, but it wasn't worth it. You don't even have as many ways to deal with them, thanks to the removal of the system from Resident Evil 2 where you board up windows with planks of wood to manage the flow. Why does a high profile sequel like this have less in it? It's baffling.Resident Evil 3 codes: All locker and safe solutions

Resident Evil 3 settings: Get the graphics rightAnd before you know it, it's all over. Resident Evil 3 rarely gives you a chance to soak anything in before it fast-tracks you to the next story beat. There's nothing wrong with a short game, but the pacing here feels off, like it's hurriedly shoving you to the next location just as you're starting to get comfortable—and before its ideas get a chance to fully form. It's ultimately an extremely shallow game, with lavish production values failing to mask just how rushed and unambitious it feels.After the imaginative, tradition-defying Resident Evil 7, and the sublimely polished, playable Resident Evil 2, this is a massive leap backwards for the series. The Nemesis is wasted—a bit player in its own game, neutered by its chronic lack of purpose. There are barely any puzzles and you're rarely given the chance to wander off the beaten path.Resident Evil 3 is essentially a chain of action set-pieces, threaded together with a paper-thin story and a few too many cutscenes. This is the direction the series started to take post-Resident Evil 4, when it seriously lost its way and we ended up with the abysmal Resident Evil 6, and I'd hate to see that happen again.Both the Nemesis and Raccoon City are massively underused in this disappointing step back for the series.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.When everything hits its mark, Resident Evil 3 is almost every bit as good as last year’s Resident Evil 2 Remake. A tense, jumpy retelling of the PS1 classic in a modern gaming language, it tries a few new ideas but works best when it sticks closely to the previous game’s template of undead crowd control and criss-crossing hub areas to unravel. Like the original game it’s a slightly more gun heavy take on the series’ zombie surviving, and one that rewards aggression more than caution to create a faster, more trigger happy adventure that’s still Resident Evil at heart. It lacks some of the depth and variety of last year’s Resident Evil 2 Remake, with less puzzles and more action, but it’s still a rewarding slice of horror. Release date: April 3, 2020
Platform: PC, PS4, Xbox One
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: CapcomCuriously, the Nemesis - the cover star and arguably the point of the whole thing - is far less of a pursuing menace than Mr X this time. I mention it now because if you were expecting the original’s set up - where he repeatedly appears to hound you - you’re going to be disappointed. Aside from the opening city section, where he chases you for a small segment, he’s largely relegated to more set piece orientated moments and tightly defined boss fight encounters.  But the opening city streets, where Nemesis first menaces you are an exciting start with a different feel after Resident Evil 2’s more subdued corridor based apocalypse. Wandering around outside during a zombie apocalypse in progress is a far more interesting location to digest as you scan the burning skyline or wonder what happened to leave all the piled up roadblocks and trashed cars. It’s also the best mix of the old and new ideas here - mainly the new dodge move and the increase in enemies. The more open areas really capitalise on the main character Jill’s ability to sidestep zombies to manage threats. In later, more corridor-y, areas dodging can be a bit hit and miss with less space to move in. This city street section is the only place where the Nemesis really appears as you might expect - a constant, lumbering, trench coated danger. Once he arrives you are constantly on the run, or at least trying to be as he leaps in front of you or lashes out with long range tentacles. When I played the game at preview stage I wasn’t entirely sold on the mechanics because having an unkillable enemy that’s always in your face can only hold your interest for so long.  But as it turns out there’s far less to worry about in the full game. Partly because when you first encounter the creature there are plenty of grenades and explosive barrels to knock him down for the minute or two’s respite you need to tick off your apocalypse to-do list. However, what is surprising is that after this opening encounter, the Nemesis never really appears in this way again and, instead, the focus shifts to more compartmentalised, structured encounters. Having plenty of weapons and ammo to deal with the Nemesis’ initial (and, really, only) face to face encounter is part of getting your head around the fact that this is a much more shooter-focused Resident Evil experience, keeping with the more action focused shift in the original game. There’s plenty of ammo this time but it might take a while to realise that you can pretty much go weapons free on any threat you find. Old habits meant I initially played with the old Resident Evil 2 mindset of making every shot count and avoiding rather than fighting enemies for a while, but that actually makes things more tricky. There are generally more zombies in any given area so it’s best to blast everything that moves to avoid getting overwhelmed. When it works it’s a satisfying role reversal that feels like you’re taking control of the zombie apocalypse rather than surviving it. That said it mainly clicks in the larger areas where you have more room to aim, reposition and manage threat spacing. With less space you can easily end up firing wildly from a corner or wall you’ve inadvertently backed yourself into. The second playable character, Carlos, also swaps the dodge for a shoulder barge that takes you towards enemies and can sometimes make things worse.Tighter spaces can also expose frustrations with the Hunter enemies who use insta-kill attacks suddenly and without warning. These are true insta-kills too that can spell death even if you’re at full health. The blind frog-like Hunter Gammas can swallow you whole, while the Hunter Beta can tear your throat out with zero warning. On the one hand it makes them a genuinely terrifying encounter in a game with some already strong jump scares, but it can be irritating to die instantly. Usually in tighter spaces where you don’t always have the room to keep the distance you need to survive too. In fact, despite extra enemies, more ammo and a few new ideas (most of which I’m either not allowed to talk about or don’t want to spoil) Resident Evil 3 works best when it sticks to what made Resident Evil 2 so good - settling into a hub-like area to unravel it; tracking from one objective to the next to progress further is just as good here as in the last game. The mid-point hospital level is an extremely enjoyable high for the game and on par with Resident Evil 2’s RCPD building as a chunky location you spend considerable time in, slowly peeling back its layers. Character wise however this actually edges out Resident Evil 2 a touch. I liked both Jill and Carlos a lot more than Leon and Claire, while the villain Nikolai is a gloriously sneery heel. Overall the writing more lovingly embraces a cheesy action movie feel that works beautifully against the zombie monster setting. At one point a character calls someone a “ballsy montherfucker” in a moment that’s 100% 80s Arnie camp machismo and I am totally here for it.Leaving the story briefly, there’s also a multiplayer option this time. Resident Evil Resistance is obviously a new angle and it’s a perfectly functional experience that’s pretty good fun. I say that having played in lobbies with people I actually know. Its escape room premise - four players battle zombies to locate keys and survive while a fifth bad guy player summons monsters and traps - works well with communication. I’ve yet to spend much time with online randoms, but as talking and working together is so key to winning as a team that it all depends on who you're with. The single player however is decent enough that the multiplayer is just a bonus. That said the main campaign does feel brief and light - I clocked a 9 hour completion time that included plenty of backtracking to find the few upgrades and extras scattered around. As I mentioned, there’s fewer puzzles, or multistage lock systems to unreveal, favoring instead a more direct progression of door opening. It lacks the breadth of the last remake in that sense but with the focus more on action it suits a faster pace and the balance still creates satisfying, albeit lighter, reimagining for the series. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"Capcom remakes another PlayStation 1 era Resident Evil on PS4 and Xbox One, but how successful is the return of Jill Valentine and Nemesis?Everyone has their favourite Resident Evil, whether it’s the original mansion horror, the terror of Mr. X and the Resident Evil 2 police station, or Resident Evil 4’s masterful reinvention of the series. But, especially when considering only the series’ first decade, we don’t think many people would say that Resident Evil 3 was the best one. Central villain Nemesis was certainly memorable but beyond that the game’s contribution to the franchise has been fairly limited, and that goes for the remake just as much as the original.Given how good last year’s Resident Evil 2 remake was it does make complete sense to try the same trick with its immediate sequel, since both games are set just a few hours apart, after Racoon City is ravaged by the T-virus and almost everyone is turned into a zombie. Obviously, Capcom didn’t know anything about the coronavirus when they first started work on the remake, but apart from a bit of exposition at the beginning it’s barely a factor in the story and Resident Evil is far too shlocky and silly for anyone to take offence.Like almost all the Resident Evils, the original 1999 game had a fraught development and was originally planned to be merely a standalone expansion to Resident Evil 2. With Code: Veronica – which did much more to move the plot and gameplay forward – a timed Dreamcast exclusive and Resident Evil 4 still years away, Capcom were worried that the franchise would lose visibility on the PlayStation and so Resident Evil 3 was rushed through to completion. And that’s equally as obvious in the remake as it was the first time around.Resident Evil 3 starts an hour before the events of Resident Evil 2 and ends a little after it, as it follows Jill Valentine, from Resident Evil 1, in her attempts to escape Racoon City and the Nemesis creature that’s been sent to kill her. There’s a neat gameplay twist in how the game starts, that we won’t spoil, but after a brief, mostly on-the-rails, encounter with Nemesis you soon find yourself on the streets of the zombified city, and even revisiting familiar landmarks such as the police station and Gun Shop Kendo.Resident Evil 3 looks and plays almost identically to the previous remake, right down to the same graphical glitch affecting some reflections, with an over-the-shoulder camera view rather than the original’s pre-rendered, fixed camera angles. The area of city you can explore is very small though, with most roads blocked off with crashed cars and debris, and so everything still works very much like a traditional Resident Evil as you tussle with zombies using only limited ammo and solve absurdly impractical logic puzzles – although there are far less than the original.Nemesis works like a more athletic and heavily armed Mr. X from Resident Evil 2. Except, for various story reasons, he’s not actually around all the time and if you do the sensible thing and run as soon as he appears you actually see surprisingly little of him. When he is active he can appear anywhere, except when you’re in a safe room, but since all you can do is slow him down there’s zero point hanging around when he turns up, reducing him to more of a mild inconvenience than the unstoppable menace he was intended to be.As in the original, you also get to play as good-hearted mercenary Carlos Oliveira, but much more than before and to the point where his sections take up at least a third of the game. This only underlines that Jill, and to be honest most Resident Evil characters, doesn’t really have much of a personality and there’s no attempt to portray her as a human being with likes, dislikes, or weaknesses. That’s hardly unusual in video games but considering how well known these characters are, despite them being essentially costumed avatars, it’s a missed opportunity of both remakes.The script no longer features the hilariously bad dialogue of the originals, although by the time of Resident Evil 3 it had already stopped being borderline incomprehensible and was by 1999 simply bland and cliché. The remake is the modern equivalent of that and while it’s competently written, adding swearing and more nefarious backstories for the villains just comes across like try-hard edginess. Thankfully it doesn’t go overboard, but the last whiffs of old school cheese, which still permeated the Resident Evil 2 remake, are now gone and the game loses a lot of its personality as a result.The real problem with Resident Evil 3 is that it doesn’t do anything to evolve either the gameplay or the mythos of the franchise. It’s also not at all scary, and it’s telling that the brief return to the police station is by far the most tense sequence in the game. This, and most of the other problems, were also issues with the original game but if anything the remake makes things worse.The original’s depiction of Racoon City had some very odd art design, that didn’t look anything like a real American city, but there was at least plenty of visual variety. But this remake is a much looser adaption than the one for Resident Evil 2, and many locations just aren’t represented at all, replaced instead by more sewers and other overfamiliar locations cribbed from Resident Evil 2. The majority of the original game was spent only in Racoon City, but here you barely seem to spend any more time on the streets than in the last remake.The first three Resident Evils all have the same basic plot and structure, but this remake only increases the similarities, to the point where it starts to feel like the video-on-demand knock-off to the cinematic original. Altering the setting for the finale (and getting rid of Jill’s one-liner when she finally defeats Nemesis) is very strange and while it doesn’t ruin anything it’s also nothing you’d count as an improvement.That’s not to say that there aren’t some things that are improved though, beyond the general gameplay and excellent graphics. There’s a fun Resident Evil 4 style siege towards the end of the game and the story tie-ins to Resident Evil 2 work much better than the original. But there’s also a strange refusal to use QTEs that seems a shame given how good Resident Evil used to be at them, as even when they do pop up they’re extremely simplistic.The binary decisions that used to appear at certain points in the story have also been removed, so this is now just a straight linear adventure that lasts around 12 hours. That’s longer than a single playthrough of the Resident Evil 2 remake but there’s no real replayability this time, beyond a small collection of unlockables.The original Resident Evil 3 was even shorter, and it tried to compensate for that with the first incarnation of the popular Mercenaries mode. The remake doesn’t have that but instead features 4 vs. 1 multiplayer mode Resident Evil Resistance. This is a completely separate game, where one person plays as a ‘mastermind’ character laying traps and triggering zombies as four ordinary players try to escape from an Umbrella testing facility.You’ve only got a limited time to do this, although you can gain more by killing zombies (and lose it for dying yourself). There are also what the game refers to as puzzles, but they really just have you collecting objects scattered at random throughout the game’s four maps. You can buy new weapons and items using in-game currency and while there are loot boxes there doesn’t seem to be any microtransactions.There’s nothing actively wrong with Resistance but having four people running around like headless chickens in the cramped level designs of a Resident Evil map doesn’t seem the best idea for a multiplayer game. And while it works okay in practice it’s not something we can imagine wanting to go back to in the future. There’s a practice mode you can play on your own, and custom rules you can set-up for playing with friends, so a lot of effort has gone into it, but it’s really just another Resident Evil multiplayer spin-off that you’ll quickly forget about.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepThe star attraction, pun intended, is the remake of Resident Evil 3 and that has its own problems, many of them not of its own making. At times it barely resembles the PlayStation 1 game, which is fine in theory but what replaces it is just an inferior rerun of the last remake. There’s a tightly designed, almost Metroidvania style structure to Resident Evil 2 that helps make it such a great game, but Resident Evil 3 feels disjointed and uninspired by comparison.If you were really going to remake the game, and try to fulfil its true potential, you’d probably be looking at some kind of open world adventure closer to a more serious take on Dead Rising. But that’s not what this is. The Resident Evil 3 remake is a fun and breezy survival horror but it’s not scary and it’s never surprising. Which means that, despite all the deviations from the PlayStation 1 version, this is one remake that’s just a bit too similar to the original.In Short: The source material already had its problems, but this disappointing remake manages to make Resident Evil 3 seem even less inspired than it was originally.Pros: Excellent graphics and fun action, that’s consistently engaging even when it’s at its most predictable. Project Resistance tries its best to offer a compelling multiplayer experience.Cons: Nemesis and the Racoon City setting are strangely underplayed, in favour of just rerunning Resident Evil 2. Bland story and characters. Not scary.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PCPrice: £49.99Publisher: CapcomDeveloper: Capcom and NeoBards EntertainmentRelease Date: 3rd April 2020Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter

Game Informer,"I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of “persistence hunting” – the idea that a hunter doesn’t need to run faster than its prey as long as they chase with dogged determination. Early human hunters would often pursue their game for hours – or even days – until they’d brought down some behemoths. After an extended chase, even the healthiest creatures must collapse, beaten and exhausted from the endless pursuit. It sounds like an incredibly terrifying way to meet your end, and if you ever wanted to know how that prey feels, play Resident Evil 3.As with last year’s Resident Evil 2, Capcom’s newest remake is a smart update to the PlayStation classic. Many of the elements from the 1999 release have been remixed in this retelling of Jill Valentine's escape from Raccoon City’s zombie outbreak. Capcom’s original release was a more action-focused experience than previous entries, and this remake continues that tradition, but that isn’t a bad thing since these firefights are so compelling. The action takes place from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective. Lining up a perfect headshot takes skill, as zombies stagger forward in erratic patterns, but the gunplay feels precise and exciting. My stomach regularly lurched into my throat as even small groups of undead crawled toward me. But when my back was against the wall, watching those zombie heads pop like melons proved especially satisfying.Between firefights, Jill scavenges for meager supplies and collects various keys that open new areas, and I loved hunting down the right key or tool to unlock each new room. However, since Jill has less downtime between set-piece moments, she has fewer puzzles to complete than Resident Evil 2 or even the original Resident Evil 3. That is disappointing mainly because the few puzzles you encounter are so well done; they offer a nice change of pace, and I liked figuring out how to reroute subway trains or calculating the correct chemical mixture to create vaccines. Resident Evil 3’s pace doesn’t suffer much from this renewed focus on combat, and the moment-to-moment action remains compelling.The biggest reason Jill rarely has a second to catch her breath is Nemesis. This 10-foot monster was created in one of Umbrella’s labs for the sole purpose of assassinating Jill. Nemesis is a grotesque figure who might send shivers down your spine with just one look, but this monster is even more imposing in motion. Unlike Resident Evil 2’s Mr. X, Nemesis is nimble and fast enough to keep pace with you. He follows you around the map, can leap in front of you to block your path, and reaches out to trip you with his tendrils. Whenever Nemesis shows up, you need to either run or dig in for a resource-draining battle. This makes each encounter with him as thrilling as it is terrifying, and when you do finally escape Nemesis' grasp, the sense of relief is palpable.The journey is full of relentless beatdowns, and you’d be foolish to try to take down every enemy you encounter. Jill’s new dodge maneuver allows her to escape almost every conflict without a scratch – if you can pull it off consistently. When you time Jill’s dodge perfectly, you slow time and have the chance to squeeze off a few free headshots. Unfortunately, the timing window for this dodge feels off; even near the end of the game, I still got hit by enemies even after I was sure I had properly dodged. That inconsistency is unfortunate, because dodging is incredibly empowering when it works.Your race through Raccoon City is the main course, but the Resistance multiplayer mode is also worth a look. In this asymmetrical 4v1 mode, groups of survivors work together to kill hordes of zombies and find several keys, which allow them to escape Umbrella's labs. I appreciate the variety among the survivors, since some heroes excel in close-quarters combat while others function as support classes. I found a good routine sitting back from the front lines, disabling traps, and helping my teammates find useful equipment, but charging into the fray is also exciting. When you get a really good team together, you feel like you can overcome even the deadliest traps. Playing as a survivor in Resistance was a fun diversion, but I got a greater thrill when I took on the mantle of a mastermind. These devious characters work from the shadows and scheme to keep the survivors in line. As a match builds, masterminds accumulate a steady stream of resources, which they can spend to set up traps and unleashing hordes of undead monsters. I laughed with sick glee after saving up a mountain of resources to spend in a single room that tied up my survivors for several minutes, which ultimately won me the match. Masterminds offer a more strategic level of play that I haven’t seen in a Resident Evil game before, and I hope Capcom continues to iterate on these mechanics down the road.With this remake, Capcom has greatly improved one of my least-loved entries in the series. Resident Evil 3’s greater focus on action affords you fewer opportunities to stop and think, but Jill's adventure is an incredible thrill ride. From the first moment that Nemesis burst through the wall and reached out with one of his tendrils, I felt my heart begin to race. I don’t think it slowed down again until the credits rolled.

GameSpot,"The remake of Resident Evil 3 makes a strong first impression, and its online companion game Resistance has some interesting ideas, but they both struggle to follow through.By 
    Alessandro Fillari
   on April 6, 2020 at 1:32PM PDTThe opening hours of Resident Evil 3 are incredibly effective at putting you on edge. A remake of the original 1999 game, Resident Evil 3 puts the volatile and intense conflict between protagonist Jill Valentine and the unrelenting force of nature, Nemesis, front and center--giving way to some strong survival horror moments that show off the best of what the series can offer. But after that solid start, this revisit to a bygone era not only loses track of the type of horror game that Resident Evil once was, but also loses sight of what made the original so memorable.Much like 2019's Resident Evil 2, the remake of Resident Evil 3 interprets the classic survival horror game through a modern lens, redesigning locations and altering key events to fit a significantly revised story. Resident Evil 3 doesn't deviate too much from the formula set by the RE2 remake, but it does lean harder into the action-focused slant the original version of RE3 had, giving you some greater defensive skills to survive. RE3's introduction is a strong one, conveying a creeping sense of paranoia and dread that's synonymous with the series, and Jill Valentine once again proves herself to be a confident protagonist to take everything head-on.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil 3 Video ReviewRE3 is very much a companion piece to the previous game, serving as a simultaneous prequel and sequel that caps off the saga in Raccoon City. There are even key points in the story that expect you to know of prior characters or locations that tie back to the previous remake. While you won't miss out on anything vital for not having played RE2, some of the previous game's most poignant moments are given more subtext in RE3. You'll eventually cross paths with supporting characters like mercenary Carlos Oliveira, the game's second playable character, along with some other unsavory individuals looking to take advantage of the chaos.It was fun to see Jill and her allies maintain their confidence and even show some snark throughout the incident, which ensures that the game isn't always so serious. Both protagonists are also given some key moments throughout the story that show off their skills and personality more, which is fun and satisfying to see play out. But disappointingly, RE3's story reaches its conclusion after a brisk six-hour campaign, which is made worse by a lackluster finish that left me wanting. While this is comparable to the original game, the shrinking scope of the remake's plot and locations makes its short run even more apparent.Throughout the game, Jill Valentine is a capable survivor, more so than both Leon and Claire, and she's well-suited to handle the undead and other bioweapon monstrosities like the Nemesis that roam the city. Along with dodging attacks, she can also execute slow-mo evasive rolls that open a clean shot at the enemy's weak point, which can be especially satisfying to pull off during an intense encounter.There's a more pronounced emphasis on action and quick reflexes in RE3, which can make the shooting, survival, and exploration loop a bit more engaging and responsive. While this ultimately gives you a greater feeling of control in the field, it's not enough to the point that it makes encounters with the ravenous undead or Nemesis easy. So while you are capable, it's often best to play it safe. Resident Evil 3 tries to stick with the tenets of survival horror gameplay and is generally far more challenging than RE2, due to its greater focus on inventory management and ammo crafting. However, the generous save points and checkpoints ensure you won't suffer too steep a loss after death.Resident Evil 3 also carries forth many of the successes from the Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives it a leg up for its own outing. As with previous games, RE3 is all about escalation, forcing you to contend with dwindling resources as the monsters--and Nemesis--put the pressure on. Unlike in Resident Evil 2, which quickly took you off the streets of Raccoon City, you spend more time in RE3 exploring the main roads, side alleys, and other points of interest in town.RE3 possesses an impeccable level of detail for the locations and action during its six-hour campaign, right down to the tense atmosphere and grisly violence. The brutality and devastation in Raccoon City is demonstrated effectively thanks to the vivid and grotesque details as you explore the ruined city. The game also draws your eyes to the many locales that reference classic Resident Evil, which is not only fun to see, but manages to tug on the nostalgic heartstrings.One of my favorite areas of RE3 is Downtown Raccoon City, which shows off the best that the remake has to offer. As an expansive map, it not only has diverse locations, and plenty of undead, it also displays the dynamic nature of the game's true star--Nemesis. The imposing villain quickly establishes himself as a cunning force when encountered out in the open.The Nemesis has many tricks up its sleeve, such as using its tentacles to trip you up or turning other zombies into horrific mutations, all of which are disturbing to witness. It'll actively stalk and follow you into places you once thought were safe--bending the unspoken rules of engagement in survival horror to establish its presence further. Nemesis makes Mr. X from RE2 come across as a fedora-wearing goon, and even when you find yourself in a safe space, you can catch a glimpse of the villain waiting outside for you to leave--which stand as some of the most unnerving moments of the game.However, as the game goes on, it becomes clear that Resident Evil 3 struggles to maintain its poise when the scope begins to narrow, and how blatantly the game relies on recycling many of RE2's tricks and tropes, which now feel less interesting. This has to do with the game's focus on momentum. Just when you're getting accustomed to a location, particularly the extensive and varied Downtown area, a story beat will occur that brings you to the next area, preventing your return. The series' penchant for puzzles are also infrequent in RE3 remake, putting more focus on exploration and combat which can eventually become exhausting.It can be tricky to balance the elements of both survival horror and action gameplay, as one can easily undermine the other, and unfortunately, this is apparent in RE3. There are many moments where the game's strengths for action and horror shine, particularly during the more open areas where the Nemesis is afoot. Generally, though--especially toward the second half--its attempts to balance both can come across as awkward and uninteresting, and at its worst, they can be jarring. This is especially true with the many elaborate set-piece encounters, where you control Jill as she navigates Uncharted-esque sequences that are highly-scripted gameplay moments that go for the cinematic effect. They often result in tonal whiplash, as you typically transition back into the slower, survival-horror pacing right after.This is most evident in the portrayal of the game's primary antagonist. Nemesis is at its best when stalking you in the streets. But these sections--while terrifyingly engaging--are fleeting. Nemesis only actively hunts you during the opening section in Downtown Raccoon City. The majority of the Nemesis encounters occur in scripted sequences that lead up to boss fights. In the original game, Nemesis' random appearances kept you on edge. In contrast, the remake's use of Nemesis in the mid-to-late game will likely have you roll your eyes at the prospect of another lengthy and fixed encounter.However, as the game goes on, it becomes clear that Resident Evil 3 struggles to maintain its poise when the scope begins to narrow...Nemesis is undoubtedly one of the most iconic villains of the series, and it's frustrating and disappointing to see it effectively sidelined, coming off more like a standard Resident Evil boss that springs out at story beats. Another side effect of the lack of Nemesis encounters in the game is that it calls attention to the lack of enemy diversity. While the series' regular zombies are in plentiful supply, most other enemy types don't show up as often, which makes combat and survival elements feel stale towards the end.In keeping with previous games, finishing RE3 opens up some additional features when you complete it, which come in the form of a shop in the main menu that lets you purchase new costumes, weapons, and other items. This allows you to essentially customize your next playthrough, giving you certain key items earlier than intended or increasing your attack power and defensive capabilities. While these changes can be fun for a revisit, there isn't much else in the way of bonus content to keep you going, aside from a new playthrough in the game's nightmare difficulty mode that ratchets up the pressure even more.Also included with the remake is Resident Evil: Resistance, an asymmetrical online mode pitting four survivors against a lone player in the role of the overseeing antagonist. In essence, it's a more accessible take on the franchise's previous experiment with online horror, Resident Evil Outbreak, with some echoes of other asymmetrical games like Dead by Daylight or Left 4 Dead. Four players use their different skills to fight off monsters and complete objectives to make it to the stage's exit. All the while, one enemy player will observe the action through security cameras to lay traps, summon monsters, and manipulate the environment to spell a quick end to the group's escape.Playing as the survivors feels closer to traditional Resident Evil, where resources are scarce and the stakes become increasingly more significant. Using each survivor's skills effectively can come in clutch during a tough fight, saving you and your team from the mastermind's tactics. As you invest time in playing as the various characters, you'll increase in rank and unlock different skills and cosmetics for them. By completing daily and weekly challenges, along with completing matches, you'll acquire RP that's spent on loot boxes that yield bonus items for the group of survivors and the set of playable masterminds.Resistance has interesting ideas when it comes to bringing the series' survival horror gameplay online, and it does an adequate job of getting you up to speed with solid tutorials. Yet the overall execution of the game's mechanics often comes off as clunky and undercooked. During peak moments of action, the controls for the survivors feel unresponsive, especially when trying to get a clean hit on fast-moving targets. Resistance lacks a personality of its own, clinging tightly to references and Easter eggs to other entries in the series. While each survivor has a backstory, they mostly pull on horror movie cliches and archetypes, and they rarely speak during the actual game, which can make it hard to connect with them.The most fun to be had in Resistance is playing as the mastermind, where you can see the survival horror gameplay play out from the other side. Some of the most satisfying moments come from whittling down the defenses of the survivors and snatching away their last vestiges of hope as they attempt their final escape. At its best it's a clever real-time strategy twist on the survival horror formula, but generally, the game's already clunky gameplay gets in the way.Resistance didn't hold my attention long, and while Resident Evil 3 is the stronger of the two, it's still disappointing. Looking back on my first playthrough of the RE3 remake, it was clear that the game reached its peak early and slowly lost momentum going forward. With the remake's shortcomings in mind, it's easy to make comparisons to the original game's approach. In addition to featuring a more dynamic and present Nemesis, Jill's odyssey had more locations to visit. It is impressive to see classic locations like Downtown and Hospital recreated, yet some other places from the original, like the Clock Tower and Park, are absent. While this won't mean much for newcomers, and the remake skirts this by setting up elaborate Nemesis encounters, the shrinking scale of the game diminishes the impact of its plot and events. It's clear that this remake of Resident Evil 3 is missing some crucial beats that could have offered a more effective and satisfying story.As a remake, Resident Evil 3 not only falls short of honoring its source, but it also doesn't quite stick the landing as a standalone horror experience. Even without taking into account the original game, or its predecessor, RE3 struggles to keep up with its pace amid a clashing of elements from survival horror and standard action. While it has a strong start and gives its principal villain some great moments, this truncated retelling of the concluding game from the original Resident Evil trilogy doesn't do it proper justice.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Capcom’s latest remake is once again excellent, but safe and shortResident Evil 3 is haunted by the gargantuan expectations of quality established by its predecessor, the groundbreaking Resident Evil 2. That is as true for this year’s remake as it was for the original PlayStation game; Resident Evil 2 was one of 2019’s best games. In 1999, Capcom’s follow-up to Resident Evil 2 was both risky and derivative, in equal measure. Resident Evil 3 shed the established tradition of a two-character, two-scenario game in favor of a streamlined, focused experience — one that set a more action-oriented tone for future Resident Evil games.There was (and still is) just the singular campaign: Jill Valentine’s fraught escape from the disaster-struck Raccoon City. The sequel recycles the stalking dread of Resident Evil 2’s Tyrant with a new threat called the Nemesis, a more present danger that is on a much more even level with the player. Nemesis pursues the player from the game’s first minutes until its end — and it knows how to use weapons like rocket launchers and flamethrowers. It is unkillable to an almost comical degree.The Resident Evil 3 remake takes fewer risks than its inspiration. The original PlayStation game offered branching story choices, and an unlockable minigame called “The Mercenaries” that would become a series staple. None of those innovations are present here, making 2020’s Resident Evil 3 play more like an extension of last year’s Resident Evil 2 remake.That was my unshakable feeling of the first few hours of the new Resident Evil 3: that this game, so similar in its style of play and visual presentation, is simply more of 2019’s (admittedly excellent) Resident Evil 2. It is nearly identical in ways that are satisfying, but offer diminishing returns. I called the RE2 remake “a fresh, expensive-looking game that evokes the best memories of the PlayStation original, while also being something altogether new.” The same is true of RE3, but the feat feels less impressive this time. We know what to expect now.There’s no doubt that the things that made the Resident Evil 2 remake great are present in Resident Evil 3. Capcom’s latest remake is a beautiful game, bearing the same sharp design and streamlining of last year’s game. But much of it feels like a lesser repeat of what was so impressive in Resident Evil 2.The zombies, most of them reused from RE2, still shamble about in ways that are frighteningly unpredictable and hard to headshot. There are new, strange monsters to fight, like the hideous sewer-dwelling frog creatures known as Gammas that showcase Capcom’s current masterful skill at visualizing gore. Their fleshy innards are gorgeously rendered, and seeing Jill Valentine crunched in two by the Gamma’s horrid maw is impressively disgusting. Even the filth of Raccoon City’s sewers and its dilapidated streets inspire graphical awe.There is also the Nemesis, a relentless hunter who lacks the, well, meme-worthy charm of Resident Evil 2’s Tyrant, aka Mr. X. Nemesis leaps around Raccoon City to hunt down Jill in ways that feel more aggravating than they are scary, and he serves as the game’s ever-mutating big boss monster. Where Mr. X felt like a truly terrifying stalker, Nemesis feels like an overpowered nuisance.The action of Resident Evil 3 is familiar and enjoyable. Little has been done to expand the gameplay mechanics of RE2, which excelled at both movement and gunplay. There is a new dodge move used to evade zombie bites, and exploding barrels that wipe out clusters of the undead. Resident Evil 3 also shakes things up at times, letting me play as secondary protagonist Carlos Oliveira for segments that offer moments of catharsis amid the more careful hours with Jill, thanks to his assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition to unload on the horrors of Raccoon City. The story starts with explosions, burning buildings, and a chase, setting the tone for the rest of Resident Evil 3. That’s what much of RE3 is: a chase, with little in the way of story revelations or interesting new character additions to the Resident Evil fiction. Our heroes, Jill and Carlos, are likable. The villains drip with cruelty and hubris. Bits and pieces of lore are scattered through notes and computer files, some of which are amusingly written. When I first fired up Resident Evil 3, I worried that its tale of a pandemic turning cities into disease-plagued ghost towns would be more of a depressing reminder of our current reality than escapist entertainment. To wit: A live-action cinematic starts the game with doctors in hazmat suits and government officials telling of a CDC-enforced quarantine. But the infection of Raccoon City is so far removed from our real-world conundrum as to be mostly unrelatable. The threat of Resident Evil is visible, in the form of zombies and other grotesqueries, and the root of its evil so tangible: the Umbrella Corporation. (The only real shared threat in our world and Resident Evil’s fantasy world, as pointed out by Jill herself, is human greed.)At around six hours, RE3 is a comparatively short experience. Your second playthrough becomes a power fantasy as you complete tasks to unlock and purchase enhancements that give you extra storage, auto-healing items, and outlandish weapons like the Hot Dogger, a knife that sets enemies on fire. There are increasingly harder difficulty options to unlock for survival-horror heads who crave something grueling and more old-school. I am currently enjoying a “hardcore” difficulty run aided by a handgun with infinite ammo and a magical healing coin.Ostensibly, the other “half” of the new Resident Evil 3 is an original multiplayer mode called Resident Evil Resistance. Actually, RE Resistance is less of an extra mode than it is a separate game — it is a distinct download, and it appears there is no crossover or connectivity between the two experiences. I’ve only spent a brief amount of time with Resistance, but it is an asymmetric 4v1 challenge in which four players as survivors attempt to escape a research facility while an evil mastermind player attempts to kill them all with an elaborate security system. My experience with it so far has felt sluggish and clumsy, and the deep well of cosmetic and equippable items to earn through long-term play already feels daunting. There’s just so much stuff to unlock, and it all feels so laborious.Resident Evil Resistance starts with access to six of the game’s playable survivors, but only one of the four available masterminds is unlocked. Getting the rest, which would add some variety to the multiplayer mode, will take ample playtime, and over the weekend, I found it time-consuming to get into a stable match. I had a mastermind drop out 10 minutes into a game, shutting it down. I’ve had persistent warnings of unstable connections to the host. Getting into a game was a long process, and despite liking the premise — which is similar to horror games like Dead by Daylight — the refined controls of Resident Evil 3 feel laggy in Resistance.Were it not for the high expectations set by Resident Evil 2, Capcom’s similarly lavish remake of Resident Evil 3 would stand out as a gorgeous example of a survival horror game lovingly and painstakingly reimagined. At times it manages to be exactly that, modernizing the story of Jill Valentine’s escape from a zombie-ravaged Raccoon City crafted with amazing production values. But the shadow of its very recent predecessor looms so large as to overshadow it. Like last year’s game, Resident Evil 3 is a great example of what a video game remake should be. It’s just that the source material is a little less impressive this time around — and so is the end result.Resident Evil 3 will be released April 3 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” PS4 download code provided by Capcom.

Kotaku,"About five minutes into the Resident Evil 3 remake, I uttered the word “brilliant.” I don’t use that word often. I don’t know if I should have used it then. Brilliance is an incredibly rare thing, but Resident Evil 3 hooked me from the start. So I used the word. It is an explosive game brimming with intensity and some of the best action in the series. If you’re looking for a moody horror experience, this isn’t it. If you want furious chases, sudden death, and overwhelming zombie horde, Resident Evil 3 will gladly kill you.Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released in 1999 for the Sony PlayStation. The original Resident Evil was claustrophobic and puzzle driven. Resident Evil 2 upped the stakes with more zombies but carried a sizzling anxiety underneath pockets of violence. Nemesis operated on a different ethos: Set during the height of the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City, the survival horror was mixed with straight out action. There were assault rifles, dashing monsters, and quick maneuvering through open streets. The titular Nemesis loomed above all, a hulk creature all but impossible to kill. It stalked the player around the city and could appear at nearly any time. It remains terrifying to this day.""This is... my Last Escape.""Friendship Management SimulatorOne of my favorite Resident Evil stories, exciting re-imagining captures the core of the original, the Nemesis is freaky, some nice replayability and unlockables. Very short, not as many puzzles as the original. Every now and then, it tosses a few too many enemies into too tight spaces.CapcomPlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC.April 3, 2020First playthrough took about six hours. Cut that in half on the second. The Resident Evil 3 remake transplants that experience into a modern framework and ratchets up an already intense experience into something downright exhausting. I mean that in the best possible way. Resident Evil 3 is a better modernization than last year’s fantastic Resident Evil 2 remake. Where that game was still puzzling out a change in format and occasionally struggled to forge an identity, Resident Evil 3 proceeds with wonderful confidence. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but Resident Evil 3 knows what it wants to be.Video game horror operates on two different philosophies. In the first, players walk up to a closed door. Anything could be behind it; the horror comes from the unknown. That model, while effective, has a downside: players choose when to open the door. They can prepare—both mentally and with in-game supplies—to face whatever lies ahead.The second philosophy allows monsters to open the door whenever they want. There’s no time for deep breath or pep talks. You will never be safe, even in the places where you think you are untouchable. No lock is big enough, no weapon strong enough, to stop what is coming. This is the philosophy at the core of Resident Evil 3. It is louder and meaner than what came before.Set after the events of Resident Evil and slightly before (and then concurrent with) Resident Evil 2, the story focuses on Jill Valentine’s escape from a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. Jill is a former member of the Raccoon Police Department’s Special Tactics and Rescue Service, or STARS. These rapid response experts were all but eliminated in Resident Evil after venturing into a monster-filled mansion. The virus responsible for the monsters was created by the nefarious Umbrella Corporation and spread into the city proper. Jill, placed on leave by the Umbrella-owned police chief, plans to leave the city under the cover of night. The sudden zombie outbreak and arrival of a tireless killer monster codenamed “Nemesis,” which has been specifically programmed to hunt down STARS members, throws that plan into disarray. What follows is a desperate struggle to survive through the worst parts of the outbreak.Resident Evil 2 featured another dangerous enemy called T-000, also known as Mr. X. During key portions of the game, Mr. X would patrol the police station and chase down the player. While he could be stopped for a time, he could not be killed. The segments with Mr. X were among the most terrifying in the game. Resident Evil 3 makes that terror the core of the experience. Right from the start, the Nemesis is chasing you. While there are moments when you’re safe, he is a far more dogged foe than Mr. X  whenever his is around. He is faster and runs after you at full speed. He is more intelligent and can use weapons. If you’re far away, the Nemesis can grab you with slimy tendrils and pull you closer. Try to run away and the Nemesis might leap over your head to block the way. Knock him down with a grenade and you might buy some time, but even if you get away he can and will show up when you least expect it. At one point, I thought I was in a safe room, but he entered it anyway. I’d journeyed through the back alleys to a power station, where I rerouted subway tracks for a train full of survivors. The city teemed with the undead and parasitically infested super-zombies. A single grab from any and I would die. Then I heard the music shift, a subtle flutter of strings indicating that the Nemesis had found me. I slipped into full-blown panic. This wasn’t my first time dealing with the Nemesis, but I’d never been at such a disadvantage before. Staggering every step of the way, blowing zombies out of my path with frenzied shotgun blasts, I entered the safe room. I thought I would have a moment to breathe. I thought I would be able to save my game or rifle through my storage box for healing items. Then, the Nemesis entered. With nowhere left to dodge, I was unable to slip out of the Nemesis’ path. He slammed me to death against the floor with a juicy crack of my skull.I knew this was possible in theory. Before I received my review code, Official Xbox Magazine reported that the Nemesis could kill players in safe rooms. This claim was ultimately disputed by Capcom. “Safe rooms,” it was said, only qualify as such if soothing music plays when you enter. I have reviewed the footage of two separate playthroughs and the previous times I entered the room, there was indeed the soft and comforting piano music of every other safe room. Resident Evil 3’s trick isn’t that there are rooms that are truly “safe” and those that just happen to have typewriters for saving your game. The trick is that Resident Evil 3 can occasionally change the rules, if only for the smallest of moments. Perhaps that room was truly “safe” before—that lovely piano tune and type writer suggests that it was—and perhaps there are rooms that are always safe. In this instance, it wasn’t. I didn’t get to prepare myself and open the door. The Nemesis opened it for me. You’re not entirely helpless. Jill is an experienced police officer, and this isn’t the first time she’s dealt with the undead. While Resident Evil 3 is a more dangerous and punishing game than the Resident Evil 2 remake, players have a few tricks up their sleeve. The most important is the quick dodge: With the press of a button, Jill can juke away from zombies or other enemies. Time it perfectly and she rolls completely out of harm’s way. It functions on the same principle as action-game mechanics like Bayonetta’s “witch time”-granting dodge moves. Time slows down in these moments, making it possible to quickly draw your weapon and land a crack shot on any zombie nearby. From time to time, you also play as Umbrella special forces soldier Carlos Oliveira. He has access to heavy weapons like an assault rifle and a powerful counter punch if a dodge is timed perfectly. Both characters have a knife that, unlike the melee weapons in Resident Evil 2, never breaks. If you run out of ammunition—which is rare, as the game doesn’t skimp on ammo—you can switch to the knife and slash away. This is risky, but Jill’s stabs are quick and come with a small hopping movement that makes it easier to fall back. These two changes sound small but give the player greater control than Resident Evil 2. Regular zombies aren’t a major threat so long as you are attentive and play things right. The result is a faster paced game. In spite of these tools, Resident Evil 3 can be incredibly punishing. While the player has options for handling rank and file zombies, many enemies have the ability to kill in a single strike if you aren’t careful. Some enemies can cause a dangerous status effect that can quickly seal your doom. This will please players eager for a challenge but will certainly piss off others. There are enemies in the game that all but require perfectly timed dodges to expose their weak points. This can be avoided if you use special weapons, but there will be times when your survival skills are pushed to the limit. Resident Evil 3 also loves to spring traps on the player. That can mean a tiny room full of nearly a dozen zombies bearing down on you. It can also mean a lone lizard-like Hunter that leaps from a distance and slits your throat in the blink of an eye. Resident Evil 3 is eager to toss players into the most dire circumstances and harshly punish any mistakes. I found myself limping around at death’s door plenty of times.This focus on action and danger, as compared to anxiety and dark exploration, means that Resident Evil 3 is more focused on set pieces than other games in the series. There are frantic ascents through burning construction sites and lengthy defense sequences against waves of zombies. This might feel antithetical to Resident Evil—after all, excess action in later installments ultimately alienated fans—but it works well here. Resident Evil 3 moves at a consistently exciting pace. As much as I appreciate peeking around corners in a cramped mansion, the action helps the game forge a unique identity and feel. Resident Evil was a haunted house attraction with rooms to explore and monsters in the closet. Resident Evil 2 functioned like a roller coaster with occasional drops into danger before rising into periods of stability. Resident Evil 3 is a falling elevator. Like it or hate it, the ride doesn’t slow down, and the pit in your stomach doesn’t let up until the end.This action underpins a story of espionage and survival that has more focus than Resident Evil 2. Jill’s attempts to escape the Nemesis weave in and out of the growing intrigue affecting Carlos and his fellow soldiers. What starts as a battle for survival spins outwards as the possibility of a vaccine for the zombie threat emerges, all while a mercenary soldier seeks to profit off the chaos. Jill and Carlos have an instant rapport, and their actors bring a playful camaraderie to each scene. Jill Valentine is a goddamn hero and acts accordingly, even in the face of the pulpiest plots. Carlos is a goodhearted man reckoning with his role as an Umbrella grunt. They are capable equals who face their situation with confidence. It’s not the deepest story—Resident Evil 3 sometimes channels the controversial Paul W. S. Anderson films and even some of the wry pulp of S.D Perry’s old novelization—but it’s told with just enough seriousness that I wanted to know where the story would go and where it might deviate from the original game.This is helped by Resident Evil 3’s commitment to graphical realism. It’s always a gamble to bet on photorealistic graphics in a medium where stylization is a calling card, but Resident Evil 3 threads the needle well. Capcom’s RE Engine is a remarkably powerful framework to build a game on, and it’s astounding how much detail is poured into each character’s performance. The Resident Evil 3 remake doesn’t completely follow in the original’s footsteps when it comes to plot structure. The original game had key moments where players could decide on Jill’s actions. These created branching paths that led to slightly different endings. Resident Evil 3 ditches these in order to keep the story more focused. It works out in the end, but it distances the remake from the original. That’s fine—remakes forge their own paths and create their own interpretations of events—but the change makes the Resident Evil 3 remake a slightly more limited experience. Besides a few puzzle segments where you might need to pause and think, the story rushes along from beat to beat. An initial playthrough, assuming extra caution from the player, will only take 4-6 hours. Replaying the game to complete hidden challenges and special items has a lot of appeal, but multiple paths could have helped flesh out the world in a more satisfying way.There was an anxiety underpinning my experience, but it wasn’t one that Resident Evil 3 could have known about. I hopped into Resident Evil 3 in the middle of a global pandemic that’s seen increasing sickness and death toll around the world. As I write this review, the United States has surpassed every other country for confirmed cases of covid-19. Resident Evil 3 opens with newscasts and press conferences outlining a growing viral outbreak, and starts with the total breakdown of life within Raccoon City. It’s a surreal experience to wander through a fake hospital, scouring through corpse-laden isolation wings and finding desperate notes from doctors outlining their dwindling supplies and fast-filling beds. In any other circumstances, these images would be a pulp fantasy. Now? Well, it doesn’t feel quite so fictitious.That isn’t to say that Resident Evil 3 is suddenly some profound social commentary or deeply relevant emotional experience. It’s mostly a game where a big scary dude chases you and you pop zombie skulls with your shotgun. But we bring as much to games as they give back to us. Resident Evil 3’s terror mostly relies on high octane chases and immensely deadly enemies, but these days there’s an entirely different fear underneath the action movie hi-jinks.“How could this happen?” the citizens of Raccoon City lament as government officials and corporations underplay and seek to profit off the outbreak. I get it now.Resident Evil 3 is loud. It is a snarling dog too close to your face, spittle flying everywhere. For some players, the intensity will be a turn off. The original version is the link between the earlier games’ simmering spookiness and Resident Evil 4’s bold action. It marked the first step in a tonal shift that arguably went too far: As the series progressed, the action grew too excessive. The remake threads a spectacular needle. The explosive boss fights and ever-present cat and mouse chases never feel out of place. Windows shatters as the zombie horde bursts in, giant lizards swallow you whole, and the Nemesis slams down behind you at the worst moment. The terror doesn’t fade simply because you have an assault rifle or grenade launcher. For good and ill, Resident Evil 3 takes last year’s Resident Evil 2 remake and hones it into something meaner. Embracing that chaos leads to an intense and confidently executed Resident Evil experience."
USgamer,"Resident Evil is best when it makes a resident of you, the player. You start each game fumbling around its haunted houses - whether they’re extravagant mansions or museums that have been turned into police stations - and eventually you become so familiar with them that they feel like home. Resident Evil 3 Remake feels more like a single room in a Travelodge. Resident Evil 2 Remake’s Raccoon City Police Department was so well realised that it was always going to be difficult to top, but this sequel feels like a step backwards in almost every way. 

Rather than a few intricate but large spaces, there are more areas with less intricacy. You’re often following a linear path to the next cutscene, of which there are many. If Resident Evil 2 Remake is a haunted house, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a rollercoaster at Alton Towers - let’s say Nemesis for thematic consistency. Nemesis is the new Mr. X, an unkillable enemy who stalks you throughout the game. You can delay him by hurting him, but he still pops back up to ruin your day. Strangely, he’s only active in emergent sequences for a tiny portion of the game, and mostly shows up in scripted scenes or boss fights. He’s woefully underused. It’s probably for the best, mind you, because he makes Mr. X look like Mr. Motivator. Not only is Nemesis faster and more agile than Mr. X, he can pull you towards him from a distance with his meaty tendrils. He can leap over your head and cut off your route. He can sprint after you and punch you in the back of the head, like a prick. He’s a nightmare, basically. Not a good nightmare, either. One of those annoying nightmares that make no sense, like a terrifying plughole. It doesn’t help that there are far more zombies in the streets of Raccoon City than there were in RCPD either. They’re everywhere, and avoiding them is often the best course of action. You can kill as many as you want, but the streets will still be crawling when you backtrack later on. Resident Evil 2 Remake allowed you to mitigate some of this by barring up windows or clearing routes, but this sequel has none of that. Outside of item management, you can’t prepare for later sections. The rules also aren’t as consistent. When you return to the police station from Resident Evil 2 - a tiny, linear route through the West Corridor - zombies can bash through doors to get to you. It’s the same in the hospital. But out on the city streets and in the apartments and shops dotted around, they apparently forget how to use doors. Then there’s the gore, which isn’t as developed as it was in Resi 2. In that game, zombie meat would slide off the bone if you shot an arm. Limbs would break and crack as bullets severed the bones. Most of this is gone, and shooting feels less impactful as a result. Since Resident Evil 3 Remake is much more action-oriented, you’d hope for combat to be improved, but it just doesn’t feel as satisfying - a big shame when you’re gunning down 20 zombies with an assault rifle that feels like a pea shooter. The only other change to combat is that now your knife and grenades can’t be used as last-chance saves when a zombie grabs you. Here you’ve instead got a combat roll when you play as Jill, so you can evade incoming attacks. Time it right and time slows, allowing you to slip away. When playing as Carlos, the roll is replaced by a punch, which is functionally the same but it sets you up for some slow-motion gunplay instead. It’s in those dual protagonists where Resident Evil 3 Remake actually feels like an improvement. Carlos and Jill look human, where Leon and Claire looked like sex dolls. They even act and emote in a human way, apart from that one time Carlos says, “There you are, dickface” to a licker. Carlos is a thirsty little bastard throughout, and Jill is an uncompromising badass. I would also give anything for Carlos’s hair. In fact, I’m still pissed off that there isn’t a mode where you escape the city as his hair. Like Resident Evil 2’s playable Tofu, but just hair with a gun. Hair. With. A. Gun. Capcom, hire me. Speaking of Tofu, that’s another thing that’s missing from Resident Evil 3 Remake - unlockable modes upon completion. One of the best things about the PlayStation original was its arcade-style Mercenaries mode, but that’s not included. Instead you have a series of in-game challenges that earn points to spend on weapons, outfits, items, buffs, and other bits you can use in subsequent playthroughs. But the more linear structure of the game makes it hard to care about playing through more than once - it’s too predictable. While this review is focused on the single-player, I have to mention that it also comes packaged with Resident Evil: Resistance, an asynchronous multiplayer mode where survivors try to escape a map while another player attempts to thwart them with zombies and traps. Its inclusion feels like an acknowledgment of how content light the main attraction is. It’s still worth playing, but Resident Evil 3 Remake is a step backwards for Capcom, coming off the back of one of the best games of last year. It’s gorgeous to look at, the jump scares will get you, and it’s like stepping into a comfy pair of slippers. But even though your feet are cosy, it never feels like home.

Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a fantastic follow-up to Resident Evil 2, but suffered from its predecessor’s success. RE2 was a step up in every way from the original and has been lauded as a survival horror masterpiece since its release. RE3, on the other hand, launched at the tail end of the PS1’s life cycle, only offered marginal gameplay improvements and has lived in the shadow of RE2 ever since.The big question is whether history is doomed to repeat itself. Last year, Resident Evil 2 remake wowed fans with an updated and expanded take on Leon and Claire’s iconic escape from Raccoon City and nabbed our Game of the Year award. Just 14 months later, Resident Evil 3 remake is poised to launch, but can it match or surpass RE2?Like the original, Resident Evil 3 remake is a prequel and sequel to Resident Evil 2 remake. The game follows Jill Valentine’s escape from Raccoon City starting a day before Leon and Claire make it into town and continuing into the day after. It also features Umbrella Biological Containment Service (UBCS) soldier Carlos Olivera, whose team is cut off from the outside by the rampant hordes of undead.The story was a bit spotty in the original RE3, but fortunately, that’s been rectified. The relationship between Carlos and Jill and Carlos and the rest of his team has been expanded significantly. Everyone’s actions are accounted for throughout the game, so there’s no more of Carlos just popping up and dipping out.For the most part, the plot hits the same beats as the original game, but long-time fans will find themselves in unfamiliar territory almost from the get-go. I’d call last year’s Resident Evil 2 a genuine remake. The game was expanded, but the environments and progression took heavy cues from the original. Resident Evil 3 is a true reimagining with significant sections of the game happening in new locations.Unfortunately, Resident Evil 3 remake does omit and change areas to a degree that may upset some fans. I enjoyed the adventure thoroughly, but I have to admit I was disappointed with the absence of familiar locations, especially towards the latter parts of the game. However, I did enjoy the areas that were expanded. Downtown Raccoon City and the hospital, in particular, have opened up considerably, and are absolutely beautiful.However, I would have liked to have seen the game take a closer look at how the infection started and how it later consumed Raccoon City. Early on, you see civilians that the UBCS has evacuated to the subway. However, you don’t interact with these people at all or hear their stories. This game was a perfect opportunity to expand the lore of what is arguably the most significant event in the history of Resident Evil, and we don’t get to see much in that regard.There’s also a distinct lack of puzzles in RE3 remake, which removes some of that classic Resident Evil charm. Beyond the series standard, find key item A and use it to unlock door B conundrums, there’s less than a handful of puzzles that require you to put on your thinking cap. The original RE3 had some of the more challenging puzzles to solve of the classic REs, so it was disappointing that more weren’t included in the remake.RE3 remake is more combat-oriented than RE2 remake and has added new options for you to fight the undead. The most significant addition to your repertoire is the dodge mechanic. This mechanic first appeared in the original RE3, where it could be used to great effect, but was hard to master and unpredictable at best. In RE3 remake, there’s a dedicated button for dodging, and it’s invaluable throughout the game.There are two types of dodges you can perform. By tapping the button at any time, your character will perform a dodge in the direction in which you’re holding the movement stick. However, if you hit the dodge button at the precise moment when an enemy starts its attack, you can perform a perfect dodge, which automatically rolls you out of harm’s way. A perfect dodge also allows you to draw your weapon to enter slow-mo and automatically aim at an enemy’s weak point. This lets you get one or two free shots in, and at higher difficulties (especially Nightmare and Inferno), it’s essential for you to master it.The dodge is also critical because enemies are much harder to put down in RE3 remake. You can’t put 3-4 rounds in a zombie’s kneecap and just slip past anymore. Instead, you have to either fight them or dodge past. Zombies seem more resilient in general, especially on harder difficulties, which means you have to really watch your ammo.Also, the gore itself seems to have been toned down. You can still blow off zombie limbs and heads, but it doesn’t seem quite as gruesome as it did in RE2 remake. This may be a technical limitation because the environments in RE3 remake are generally more expansive than those in the previous game, but I do miss how juicy zombies used to be. Of course, the star of RE3 remake, besides the living cast, is Nemesis. This trenchcoated cousin of Mr. X is a thorn in Jill’s side throughout the game and represents an upgrade over the Tyrant seen in RE2. While Mr. X was imposing and unrelenting, he was content to clomp after you at a brisk walk. Nemesis is not as patient, and he’s a much more imposing villain to face.Nemesis looks great in RE3 remake and remains a formidable opponent. You can still choose to fight him when he appears for a case of goodies, but he no longer goes down for the count. After he goes down into repair mode, you have about a minute of peace before he’ll charge back into action. Also, unlike Mr. X, Nemesis doesn’t have any compunction about warping around, and if you manage to outpace him, he’ll take to the rooftops and drop down in front of you.Unfortunately, Nemesis has many of the limitations Mr. X did. For gameplay purposes, he won’t follow you into specific areas, and the chase sequences with him are relatively brief. However, they do strike the right balance between exhilarating and annoying. There’s only so much you can be chased in a game like this before it starts wearing thin, after all.While some features introduced in the original Resident Evil 3 remain intact in the remake, there are a few notable omissions that disappointed me. The Live Selection system really served to distinguish Resident Evil 3 from Resident Evil 2 and led to some interesting variations in gameplay. Unfortunately, those have been stripped out of the game completely, which give RE3 remake a more linear feeling than the original.Live Selections also often served the purpose of letting you choose whether to engage in combat or not. For example, in the original RE3‘s RPD area, you could grab Brad’s ID card to unlock the doors inside the station and risk getting pummeled by Nemesis, or you could run inside and have to go out of your way to find Jill’s ID. Each choice gave a feeling of risk versus reward that could make or break a playthrough. With RE3 remake, there’s one path, and there aren’t really any decisions to be made outside of inventory management.Also gone are the random events that occurred in the original (which are illustrated wonderfully here by legendary guide writer Dan Birlew). Now, the plot works in a straight line. You always meet Carlos at the same place, instead of having the possibility to run into him in the restaurant or newspaper building. Ammo, enemies, and weapons are always in the same place in RE3 remake (at least until you unlock the Nightmare difficulty). It feels like some of the core gameplay additions that made the original RE3 an evolution in design from RE2 are absent here.Without Live Selection and randomization, the story mode features little replayability unless you’re a completionist. There is an in-game store where you can buy items like infinite ammo firearms, defense medals (e.g., RE7), and extra side packs to start the game with. However, once you’ve hit S rank in each difficulty, unless you’re into speedrunning, there’s not much of a reason to play the story again. There are two difficulties unlocked, which feature remixed enemy, weapon, ammo, and item spawns, and which force you to change your route through the game a bit. However, they don’t add any new story elements or endings, and as far as I can tell, they’re not true randomizers.With many of the gameplay elements introduced in the original RE3 stripped away, Resident Evil 3 remake feels inferior in design to RE2 remake. Last year’s Resident Evil 2 felt like a proper remake because it had everything the original did (besides a few enemies), and then added on top of that foundation to form a great modernization of the classic. Sure, the B scenario was a bit weak compared to the original, but you got two really solid campaigns, and great revamps of the 4th Survivor and Tofu Survivor bonus modes.Also missing from Resident Evil 3 remake is Mercenaries mode. Operation Mad Jackal was an excellent evolution of The 4th Survivor seen in the previous game and had players scrambling through the ruins of Raccoon City, killing creatures, and saving hostages for points. It added a considerable amount of replayability to the game and made up for the lack of a second scenario.As it stands, Resident Evil 3 remake has one story scenario with relatively low replayability, which clocks in around the time of one of the 1st Run scenarios from RE2 remake. I beat the game in around seven hours my first time through on Standard (Normal), watching every cutscene and thoroughly exploring each area. However, my time was 01:37:49 on Assisted (Easy), and I clocked just over two hours on Hardcore (Hard) on subsequent playthroughs.If you consider Resident Evil: Resistance part of the RE3 remake package, the above isn’t as big of a deal. However, I don’t really feel like an online multiplayer mode, one that will eventually shut down and is entirely dependent on player count and cooperation to enjoy, is a proper replacement for Mercenaries mode. I’ll be able to play the original RE3 Mercenaries from now until the day I die as long as I have a PS1. You can’t say the same about Resistance.I guess the thing that strikes me the most with RE3 remake is the feeling of absence. If you’re a long-time fan of the series, it’s hard not to be disappointed with some aspects of the game. The big difference between this title and RE2 remake is that RE2 remake felt like it supersedes its source material, it’s the new standard. RE3 remake only exceeds the original in graphical prowess and story coherence (which is mostly due to the elimination of the random branching, which helped make the original so compelling).Despite my disappointment at some aspects of Resident Evil 3 remake, it’s far from a bad game. In fact, my biggest issue is that I want more than what’s there. Though the story is short, what’s there is exhilarating, and it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I can only imagine how good it would be if Capcom gave it another six months to a year in development, and all the missing features and abridged or cut locations were included.If you look at the $60 price tag for Resident Evil 3 remake and consider it to be $40 for RE3 and $20 for Resident Evil: Resistance, I think you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck. Sure, RE3 remake doesn’t have the amount of content and replayability that RE2 remake does, but it’s also technically not full price if you think about it.I thoroughly enjoyed escaping from Raccoon City again, and I loved the expanded story. Resident Evil 3 remake is a great game that is held back from being truly excellent by a few factors. However, series fans will love seeing Jill and Carlos in a new light, and it’s practically a must-play for anyone who loved RE2 remake.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkResident Evil is one of my most-played series in my three-decade-long gaming career. I still recall the first time I played the original: where I was, what my room looked like, how it felt to finally finish that last stand finale.But my appreciation for the franchise only grew from there. It’s insane to think about how each entry has brought something new to the table: Resident Evil defined survival horror for many years and gave us the memorable mansion setting, RE2 boldly went with the dual protagonist route, RE3 dialed-up Mr. X and had the Nemesis stalk the player while randomizing items and providing small narrative choices, and RE4 brought the series into a more action-oriented direction and shook the industry to its core. That’s to say nothing of the co-op refinements of RE5 and the many virtues of RE7. I’m not forgetting a mainline entry, am I?The point is, Resident Evil is pretty much always relevant, and the RE2 and RE3 remakes are only proving that assertion: though the latter makes a slightly weaker case than the former.Resident Evil 3 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: CapcomPublisher: CapcomRelease: April 3, 2020MSRP: $59.99It feels like forever ago when a Resident Evil 2 remake was just a pipe dream: a mere Facebook post that ran on a hope and a prayer. But it did come out, and it was universally beloved. I’m not so sure Resident Evil 3 is going to have that same warm reception.I’ve always been of the mind that in many ways, the original RE3 is a better game than the initial release of RE2. I was pretty much alone at the time, but over the past two decades and hundreds of speedruns later, some people are coming around to it. The Nemesis is a large reason why RE3 has so much personality: an indomitable force that’s always present, or makes his presence felt if he isn’t physically around. He was, and still is, a perfect horror schlock amalgam, much like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers.His looming doom is impactful in this remake where he could be lurking around every corner, sometimes in a comical Looney Tunes-like fashion. The dodge system (which is more like a modern parry and less wonky than it was in the original) also fulfills that same oddball touch of making you feel more tense in the moment. Resident Evil 3 made a deliberate choice to start shifting the series to an action focus, and the remake continues that trend, dialing things up. The dodge is hard to master, but like many modern action games, provides a sense of accomplishment when you finally nail it. Also, kudos to Capcom for bringing knife runs back to the forefront.The new framework as a whole is a stark contrast to Resident Evil 2‘s labyrinthine, lonely feel: for better or worse. Much of RE3 takes place on the open streets of Raccoon City. You have a squad of special forces-like characters backing you up and more citizens are running around more frequently, which consequentially allows the city to feel more lived-in. It’s bigger, but in some cases, more bombastic. RE3 was always comfortable walking that action-survival tightrope and continues to do so in 2020.This is no more evident than the intro of the game, which is not only harrowing, but grounds Jill to the main conflict in a way the original never did. The cracks are much more filled in here from a narrative standpoint, alongside of a sassier Carlos who plays a more direct role. Speaking of those drastic changes, I’d say this is the most divergent Resident Evil remake by a country mile. Locales are utterly changed on top of the aforementioned story beats, with more clear tie-ins to the Resident Evil 2 remake. Entire sections of the original RE3 are excised, as are the choose-your-own-adventure “live selection” cinematics I cherished so much.Playing through the remake, I was consistently torn. Some sections are better and have more personality, but the flow feels more linear. The Resident Evil 2 remake did a great job of keeping that classic franchise feel going with its heavy-puzzle focus and the giant police station that served as a grounded and varied RPG dungeon, but RE3 frequently jumps from place to place in a chapter-like format. But then it keeps coming back from the brink, in part due to the power of the engine.The character models and aesthetics look fantastic, and add to the sense of dread you feel as you fight through the city piece by piece; I just wish there were a few more locations to enjoy it all with. To accomplish all of this, a few things have been stripped away from the original in the process. Multiple endings are out (understandable), as is the Mercenaries mini-game (less understandable as the progenitor-Mercs modes were in the RE2 remake) and the aforementioned time-stopping event choices. Resistance, an asymmetrical (survivors versus mastermind) multiplayer-focused mode, is included to sort of make up for a few of those pivots. We have an entirely separate article dealing with that, but having played a bit I will say this: I kind of wish we just got more Resident Evil 3, as it lacks a strong postgame currently.For reference, I beat Resident Evil 3 twice for this review. My first playthrough was roughly six hours, and there’s an “under two hour” challenge: just to give you an idea of how quickly you can run through it if you put your mind to it. Once you’re done, you can unlock “shop” items with challenge points like extra items and weapons, and there’s also a reward for beating the game on veteran (hard) mode. There’s no immediate satisfaction like Resident Evil 2 provided with back-to-back Claire and Leon runs.The remake of Resident Evil 3 is going to be divisive, just as the original was. While the action enhancements help the game mechanically (to the point where I wouldn’t mind seeing them in other remakes), the stripped-down focus and removal of some of the original’s weirder experiments hurt it. That all said, I’m still up for a yearly playthrough of both the original and the remake.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. It covers the single-player portion of the game. Resistance is covered in a separate article.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Login NowCapcom's reimagining of Resident Evil 3 steps out of its predecessor's shadow to carve out a unique identity full of refined, robust, and varied gameplay.Resident Evil 2 was the rare sequel that did everything right: two characters instead of one, four campaign scenarios, and a new setting, the RPD, that outdid the first game's Spencer Estate in every way.Capcom followed up with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis 20 months later. It was good, very good, but fell short of its predecessor. There was only one campaign compared to RE2's four, a dramatic reduction in replay value. Some of its mechanics, such as quick turns and crafting ammo, were well-received; others, namely dodge, were clunky. More than anything, RE3 fell victim to franchise fatigue. It was the third Resident Evil in three and a half years, and felt more like a half-step forward compared to RE2's leap.When Capcom announced a remake of Resident Evil 3 due out less than 15 months after 2019's remake of Resident Evil 2, I thought history was doomed to repeat itself. What could a remake of RE3 offer besides, yet again, an incremental step forward from the game that preceded it?Imagine my surprise and delight when, approximately one hour into my first run, I realized Resident Evil 3 remake was not only just as good as last year's game. It was better.Resident Evil 3 remake stands on the same premise as the original. Jill Valentine, one of the last members of S.T.A.R.S. and survivor of the ""mansion incident"" a few months prior, is tying up loose ends so she can escape Raccoon City, where Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus is running amuck. The appearance of Nemesis, a bioweapon engineered by the Umbrella Corporation to seek out and kill S.T.A.R.S. members so they can't divulge Umbrella's dirty secrets, causes an abrupt change in plans.Where RE2's remake hewed close to the original's trappings, most of RE3's environments, puzzles, and story beats have been rebuilt the ground up. In fact, the story shines as one of the many highlights of the game. The writing and voice-acting are more refined and grounded than last year's RE2 remake. Jill, Carlos, and his squadmates feel more like flesh-and-blood characters this time around. The partnership between Jill and Carlos is particularly noteworthy for its slow burn--not of romance, but of mutual trust and respect. The story is not as lengthy as the original's, but what's here is of significantly higher quality than what we got in 1999.Resident Evil 3 is more reimagining than remake, one that long-time players should find almost as challenging as players who have never joined Jill in her last escape. Capcom's RE Engine continues to turn out environments as beautiful as they are appropriately disgusting. Navigation is organic; wrecked cars, corpses, and debris block streets, so you'll have to cut through looted stores and abandoned restaurants, opening shortcuts and new paths that will come in handy when you need to stay one step ahead from you-know-who.Raccoon City's environs are as functional as they are visually impressive. Some streets are claustrophobic; others are more expansive. Explosive barrels return, inviting you to attract as many zombies as you can and lure them within the barrel's blast radius. Portable generators release a blast of electricity when shot, stunning nearby enemies while you flee to relative safety. The design of each street, store, sewer, and courtyard add strategic layers to progression. As you move, you'll need to account for where barrels and generators can be found in addition to survival horror staples: when to heal, when to conserve ammo, choosing a longer but safer route as opposed to a shorter but more dangerous passage.That emphasis on decision-making and the consequences that come with each step you take is part and parcel to Resident Evil's brand of survival horror, but it's never felt as weighty as it does here. The X-factor in every decision you make is Nemesis, and how you choose to deal with him.You cannot kill the ultimate hunter. Your only option is to become the ultimate prey.Resident Evil 2 remake's take on Mr. X was everything Nemesis was in 1999, but better. Relentless, powerful, and an order of magnitude more terrifying thanks to the benefit of modern technology that let him roam freely once players triggered his appearance. His visual design played a part in the terror he inspired, but his sound design was even more critical. No matter where you were, you heard him stomping around over the pounding of your heart. I can't count the number of minutes I spent cowered in a safe room, knowing where I had to go and how best to get there, yet paralyzed by the heavy tread of his footsteps throughout the RPD, fully aware of the possibility that I'd round a corner only to see him stride out of the darkness, face expressionless, ready to send me screaming back to safety.But Mr. X, foreboding as he was, never moved faster than a brisk walk. If you kept a cool head, you could manipulate him to go one way while you ran in another.Nemesis is not so easily manipulated. Dare to fight him up close, and he'll pummel you with right hooks. Try to run, and he'll charge you from behind or lasso you with his tentacle and reel you in. Manage to break away, and he'll vault over you and crash back to earth right in front of you. Find shelter in a building he can't enter, and unlike Mr. X, who'd wander off like he had forgotten seeing you duck into a save room two seconds earlier, and Nemesis will post up outside your location, and remain there. Waiting.""Take your time,"" you can imagine him saying. ""I've got nowhere else to be.""You cannot kill the ultimate hunter. Your only option is to become the ultimate prey. Learn routes through the city as well as you know the back of your hand. Put zombies between you and him so he plows through them en route to you. Race for a barrel or generator and stun him, then run. Or, if you're feeling brave, wait until he's stunned, then hit him with everything you've got. He'll drop to one knee after absorbing so much punishment, like Mr. X. He'll even drop a goodie for you, just like he did in '99. Don't waste time gloating: Nemesis regains his composure much faster than Mr. X.This addresses one of my chief complaints from RE3 (1999). The game often let you choose whether to fight Nemesis or run, and the game's geometry was such that Nemesis could easily be tricked into getting caught on it. Watching this unstoppable killer walk in place while you took potshots at him until he dropped, unable to reappear until his next scripted encounter, punctured his aura of terror. You shouldn't be able to ""cheese"" the ultimate hunter. You shouldn't even want to fight him.Now, fighting him is an option, but it's not the best solution. This is brilliant design: Capcom lets you decide between fight or flight. I finished my first playthrough without claiming any of Nemesis's drops. Only later, when I felt confident in my arsenal and the ins and outs of the locations, did I chance a skirmish, and even then, I got away as fast as I could.If you don't have much experience with RE3's dodge mechanic before your first dust-up with Nemesis, you'll learn fast. Dodging premiered in the first incarnation of RE3, but it was clunky. The mechanic is much improved here. Tap the dodge button, and you'll lunge away from danger. You can dodge any time you like to put distance between yourself and a monster. But if you time it just right, usually a heartbeat before an enemy attack lands, and the screen will flash, Jill will roll forward, and time will slow for a split second, giving you an opportunity to score a free hit, or keep moving.Nemesis tests your mastery of dodging. You'll spend most of your time running away from him, so his attacks will come from behind. That means you won't always see them, but you don't need to. Every enemy attack comes with an audio cue: the screech or roar of a zombie as it grabs for you; the faster, heavier tread as Nemesis breaks into a run and prepares to swing at your exposed back; or the whistle of his tentacle as he throws it at you. Those audio cues can be studied, just like attack animations, and dodged as smoothly.As in the original game, Nemesis evolves after each fight. So do you. You'll find that after every encounter with Nemesis, your reflexes and timing are that much sharper. Your dodges don't have to be perfect--any landing you can walk away from and all that--but the thrill of pulling off a perfect dodge is comparable to deciphering attack patterns in a Dark Souls game and rolling at exactly the right moment.Once, I dodged a punch from Nemesis, from behind, as he chased me up a set of stairs. I nailed a perfect dodge and rolled up the stairs toward the door at the top. Instead of hitting the door like a brick wall, it flew open, and Jill rose smoothly to her feet and sprinted through. The rush of adrenaline and gratification I experienced made me leap to my feet, hands trembling, breath shaky.No time to celebrate. Nemesis was still coming.Resident Evil 3 swings between sweaty-palmed survival horror and exhilarating action.Resident Evil 3's designers said early on that they would lean more into action in order to stay true to the original title. RE3 was never an action game; it had action elements. That's the case here, but the balance is better, finer, and more rewarding for it.If that gives you cause for concern, don't worry. This isn't Resident Evil 5 or, mercifully, RE6. Like a pendulum, Resident Evil 3 swings between sweaty-palmed survival horror and exhilarating action. There's more survival horror than there is action, but action sequences are perfectly placed within the story to give you a release for all the tension that's built up over the previous 30 to 60 minutes of play. Resident Evil 3 achieves a rhythm between action and horror, always ensuring that the former is the exception that proves the latter as rule.That balance extends to every facet of the game. Combat against non-boss monsters is engaging, with some enemies more vulnerable to certain weapons than others, encouraging you to exploit weaknesses. Going up against one monster, or a pair, inspires as much fear as running into a street crawling with zombies. Boss fights are thrilling and strategic, a vast improvement over the RE2 remake's reliance on ""hit it until it dies"" encounters.Hardcore mode returns, but now you may save as often as you like. No more finite ink ribbons. That may sound like a bad thing, especially for players who pride themselves on punching new holes in their Hard Game Club card, but consider: You must still limit your saves on Hardcore if you want to achieve the game's highest ranking. Capcom isn't making you save, but RE3 throws a lot at you, and you'll be grateful for every typewriter you find. It's up to you whether to use them.RE3 is a shorter game than its original form, though not by much, and it's for the better. Capcom reimagined Jill's flight from Raccoon City with Jill and Nemesis in mind. Everything in this reimagining revolve around them. As it should. Any component of the original that did not fit the story of Jill and Nemesis--their battles, their evolution as characters and fighters and survivors--posed a distraction. The final package is as tightly designed a Resident Evil experience as you can find.It's also one of the most robust. Aside from a few reworked puzzles and a tougher first trek through the RPD, the secondary scenarios in Resident Evil 2's remake play identically to the default campaigns. Resident Evil 3's remake contains unlockable modes that rearrange item and enemy locations. There's also a shop where you can buy special weapons and items by cashing in points you earn as you play and replay Jill's adventure.The addition of a store and remixed campaign add significantly more replay value than Resident Evil 2 remake's ""2nd Run"" scenarios. Its replay value is also much stronger than the original RE3's. I've played through the game four times, just unlocked yet another mode, and am excited to go back to Raccoon City again.Fans spent over 20 years clamoring for a remake of a specific entry in the series, and it wasn't Resident Evil 3. Let that serve as proof that developers often know what we want better than we do. I did not go into this review expecting RE3's reimagining to be the best Resident Evil I've played, or one of the best games I've played, ever. Every inch of Resident Evil 3 has been polished to a blinding sheen. From gameplay and replay value, to the overhauled story and environments, this game is a masterpiece, and the new standard bearer for Capcom's franchise.This review is based on PS4 and Steam review codes provided by the publisher.

					David Craddock posted a new article, Resident Evil 3 review - A S.T.A.R. is born 
					Sounds great. I quite ejoyed the ~45 minutes I spent with the demo.				
					Well I wasn't exactly sold before, I am now				
					Weird, other reviewers are panning this game. Shirif also said it’s boring. 				
					Not boring, merely not as good as RE2 remake. But few games are. 				
https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/resident-evil-3?ref=hp panned. a disaster, a flop. utter failure hated by all				
					I'm saying average to glowing. IGN and Game Informer also gave it 9s. GameSpot gave it a 6. I don't know how Kotaku's scale works, but they like it too. I expect this game to be a tad divisive. Individual areas such as the Raccoon City streets are intricately designed, but the world isn't contiguous like RE2make's. I was fine with that. The gameplay systems and replay value are through the roof, and that's what I look for. RE2make's replay value, despite offering four campaigns, was significantly weaker. The second campaigns, or runs, do not diverge enough from the first set, other than a few reworked puzzles and your first trip through the RPD. More in the review, but in short: While both games are fantastic, I even say in my review that I wasn't expecting to like RE3R as much as I do. Color me surprised and pleased.				
					*seeing instead of saying.				
					Hmmm. I might pick this one up. This might be a game shirif and I disagree on if I enjoy it. 				
					Play the demo, it is free				
					There's definitely more action than in RE2, but 1) that was the case with RE3 ('99) as well, although 2) this game balances action and horror much, much better than the original.				
					Yeah, I only did two of NuRE2's campaigns; it's a great game but that was enough of it given the limited changes.				
					I did all the tofu runs, and may never recover from the level of self-hatred that required.				
					[deleted]				
					Waiting for Halloween? 
					[deleted]				
					What about the multiplayer?				
					Servers aren't online. Also, Resistance doesn't launch from within RE3R, so we're treating it as a separate game, and will review it separately.				
					Cool, pretty curious about that too. Honestly though I'm an RE diehard so I'll be getting this regardless				
					Is the store open from the beginning of the game? I'm guessing that's where I cash in my ""20 bobblehead"" prize from the demo				
					The Store opens after you finish the game once. You still earn points to buy items as you play, though. 
					Are the the ""ambassador points"" from the RE website or are they a different currency?				
					Hmm, not sure.				
					Some good website content would be listing the items in the store and how many points it costs to get each one. Some clicks waiting to be had. 				
					There may or may not be a guide along that line when the embargo on such content lifts.

A few months ago, Resident Evil 3 Remake sounded like a slam-dunk idea for a good video game. Take everything that made last year's Resident Evil 2 Remake a gorgeous, haunting surprise, then sprinkle a dash of RE3's exclusive, terrifying ""Nemesis"" character into the formula.Of course, nobody could have predicted how on the nose RE3's plot, derived from the 1998 PlayStation 1 original, would feel at the dawn of spring 2020. As in: prior games' viral zombie outbreaks, which were mostly contained inside of classic environments like mansions and police stations, explode into the streets. A city panics. A government responds.Hmm.We know, this is a decades-old series about zombies and cheesy plots, and dialogue classics like ""the master of unlocking"" mean we should always take the RE series' ""moral quandaries"" with a grain of cultural salt. But it's part of the critical question at this point: are you the kind of coronavirus shut-in who's eager for pandemic-related content? (Netflix says you're not alone.) Or would you rather put more ""escape"" into your escapism?I'll get into this, along with the more timeless question of how good (and how short) Capcom's latest horror-remake game has turned out.A quick refresh: Resident Evil games revolve around slow, creepy walks through constrained environs, where players must solve mild puzzles and contend with a range of undead horrors. (The series' cinematic horror aspirations mean this usually happens in third-person view with limited ammo, as opposed to a Doom-like gun-stravaganza.) It has been that way since 1996, and while ""next-gen"" versions expanded and redefined various series tenets, the core terror has remained the same—and the last two games were good enough to prove Capcom isn't out of good Resident Evil ideas just yet. That had us optimistic about this one.My biggest RE2 Remake complaints revolved around two things: you had to manage a minuscule inventory system, and you had to retread quite a bit of ground for some ho-hum ""get the key from room C, run all the way back to room B"" stretches.Imagine, then, that every RE2 Remake highlight has returned. This year's RE3 Remake is a visual stunner, in terms of cranking every imaginable real-time effect from the prior game one notch higher. It's an audio delight, as it paints a terrifying, memorable 3D soundscape around players' ears. Its modernized control system has returned with a cool new maneuver: a quick-dodge step that, when timed perfectly, gives players a slow-mo opportunity to either escape a monster's clutches or aim a perfect round of buckshot into their undead faces.Meanwhile, my beast of a testing PC (i7-8700K, RTX 2080 Ti) can run the game at maxed-out settings, 1440p resolution, and lock to 144fps during combat and 120fps during real-time cut scenes.Even better, my two core complaints from last time around have been firmly addressed, and somewhat in tandem with each other.The original RE3 broke the series out of its classic mansions and moved its action into streets, sewers, and other buildings. But in 1998, that change was mere window dressing. Every scene saw 3D characters run over and around pre-rendered backdrops (similar to the PS1's Final Fantasy games), so in that case, Capcom was swapping one pre-rendered series of environments for another. The actual gameplay didn't feel very different, and the required back-tracking and key-collecting stuff still felt stodgy.Whereas in RE3 Remake, this classic emphasis on open environments means a lot more forward momentum and a lot less back-tracking. A few times in the game, your main character (either Jill or Carlos, as you alternate between each depending on the game's chapter) will be stuck in a region that requires some puzzle-solving and key-gathering to get through a critical barrier and run to the next crazy region. But once you leave an old zone, it's gone. No back-tracking, no excess padding.What's more, each zone dumps more monsters, more danger, and more reasons to use your guns than in RE2 Remake, including some harrowing run-and-shoot sessions. An early, panicked portion makes clear that the game alternates between overstocking on supplies and burning through them all just to live. This means the game's limited inventory system puts pressure on players to make big sacrifices: what should you store at a given time? Maybe put the shotgun away to make more room in your inventory for requirements like keys? What's the bare minimum combo of health and weapon supplies that I might need when the tension ramps up, which I won't get to restock until I get through the next Nemesis chase?The resulting urgency pairs well with the most giddily grotesque visuals this series has ever seen. At its best, RE3 Remake hits some memorable, fist-pump-hell-yeah levels of horror intensity.The biggest casualty to this approach, sadly, is the game's length.Capcom has opted to not only bolster the number of in-game environments but also streamline how quickly you might dash through some of them. As I hinted earlier, 1998's RE3 was the first game in the series to crank up combat as a series tentpole, as opposed to encouraging players to put their guns away and run, run, run away from various enemies. (Though that's still an option in various sections of RE3 Remake.) A variety of super-powered zombies and beasts emerge this time around, and this remake is happy to delight in these moments as replacements for the old ""find five items to unlock a door"" chains of yore.RE2 Remake was wise to remix its original content on behalf of its storytelling. Its classic story of Claire and Leon unfolded in a cool new way, complete with a remixed intro sequence that stretched from a gas station to a rush through a city until settling on the police station of old. RE3 Remake does something similar with its opening sequence, which is undoubtedly an improvement over the original RE3's confusing introduction. It creates a sense of place and introduces the Nemesis monster in far more dramatic fashion. But it also misses the mark of RE2 Remake's interesting stakes—of Leon and Claire briefly bonding before a forced, terrifying separation. RE3 Remake's star, Jill Valentine, emerges as a solitary figure of panic, and by the time she collides with Carlos, the results feel hokey (though, again, not as bad as the 1998 original).What we are left with is a game that concludes at the 6.5-hour mark with little incentive to retread—I'll leave a spoiler-tagged explanation in the comments below—and certainly less than RE2 Remake's hearty ""second quest"" options. (My save file counted 5.5 hours, which was padded with roughly an hour of saving-and-reloading through tough spots.)We couldn't get into a match during the review period, however, so we're left wondering how this very meager-looking mode might somehow outclass the last four-on-one game of note, Evolve. (That one didn't last long.)Thankfully, this angle melts away once Jill meets the monstrous, seemingly invincible Nemesis creature. At that point, most of the game looks more like a classic zombie film than an uncomfortable, ripped-from-headlines passage. The issue comes because the game is quite short, so the exceptions—a poster about staying vigilant in the face of fever symptoms, or a diary entry about a hospital running out of room for patients—stand out that much more. Slight as they are, they're a noticeable percentage of RE3 Remake's scant runtime.I'm not docking points from the game for this brief-yet-icky correlation with my own life hiding in my apartment for the foreseeable future. Resident Evil has been mining this ""viral outbreak"" motif for decades now, complete with plots that juggle corrupt governments, secretive private researchers, and tragic consequences. I may always remember this game's awkward timing in terms of launching in April 2020, but not so much that its content can't be enjoyed in relatively timeless fashion.My bigger beef is that RE3 Remake fumbles the plot possibilities enabled by zombie video games. The game's most intense action sequences do right by the original, but we're given very little opportunity to watch the game's main characters bond during and between firefights and thus take advantage of the storytelling possibilities enabled by multi-hour video games. If you want a memorable action video game, RE3 Remake will deliver—albeit briefly. If you want that action coupled with cheesy, relatable humanity, on the other hand, RE2 Remake is a better bet, if not a dive into your favorite binge-worthy zombie TV series.Verdict: It's good, but it's not $60 good.
