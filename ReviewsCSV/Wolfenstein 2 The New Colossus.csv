Eurogamer,"Mein BAMF.Midway through Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, series protagonist BJ Blazkowicz falls to drinking moonshine and talking politics with a lefty firebrand in the sealed-off, waterlogged remnants of New Orleans. The man - a rebel general you've been sent to recruit - screams at BJ about well-heeled imperialists grinding up the proles in capitalism's war machine, and BJ roars back about good-for-nothing bohemians and bolsheviks dodging the draft. The camera circles the table unsteadily, as if waiting to cut in. To the rear, a female college professor crisply picks off Nazis in the street below while an African-American clarinet virtuoso launches into a jazz solo, accelerating the tempo as the scene unfolds. In short order BJ chugs down so much hooch that he topples over into a stupor. Impressed by his forthrightness, the general agrees to join your cause.It's a pretty good summary for the story as a whole: a stylish and drunken confusion of screeds, motifs and caricatures plucked from the subversive 60s and copiously reimagined, care of an alternate-history premise in which Nazi Germany prevailed over the Allies using gadgets stolen from a mystical Jewish sect. Dreamers, stiffs and crazies raging, bleeding and hugging it out against a steady chorus of gunfire - all of it somehow funnelled into the woozy, battered persona of one of the industry's longest-serving action heroes. There is much about The New Colossus that is clumsy and self-indulgent, even a little reprehensible, but that's because it strains to address ideas big budget first-person shooters seldom dare to, and I would argue that even its failures are worth experiencing. Launched at a time when real-life fascism is resurgent in the USA, it's a game people will be picking apart and mulling over for years to come. It gives great shotgun, too.There is a sense throughout that MachineGames wants to leave BJ behind but doesn't know how to let him die. As The New Colossus begins he's fading fast, rattling around the gigantic, wonderfully furnished submarine that serves as your mission hub in a wheelchair with his legs and guts in tatters. Eventually, he obtains an arcane exosuit that restores your ability to walk and duck, but he remains a hero ""on autopilot, waiting to hit the wall"", as one ally puts it. After decades of war BJ's psyche is imploding, reverting to its point of origin. Early on you're introduced via flashback to his bigoted Texan brute of a dad and beaten-down Polish mother, in a somewhat gratuitous, superficial tale of domestic abuse that does take a more engaging, Gone Home-ish turn in a later level. While squeezing through vents in search of giant cyborgs to blow up or electrocute, you'll hear him mutter to the ghosts of fallen comrades, promising to join them soon. ""All they are. All they've felt. Like water. Like it never was."" For the first few hours, I was only too ready for BJ to pop his clogs. The developer's first Wolfenstein game was broadly about rehabilitating an archetype that had run its course, the last gasp of a typically 90s videogame dudebro who had belatedly discovered emotional complexity or at least, the ability to suffer visibly, as a means of staving off irrelevance. The New Colossus initially feels like a continuation of the theme, which is disappointing given its unusual and charismatic supporting cast, but slowly evolves into something a bit more challenging. Wolfenstein's guilty secret, present in every instalment but only really dwelt upon in this one, is that BJ would make a pretty convincing fascist. As one unsuspecting kommandant observes during a conversation that's straight out of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, he's the very picture of the Aryan superman, with a granite jaw, blond hair, shoulders you could park a Panzerhund on and piercing blue eyes to boot. He's also an innately conservative ""man of action"", in the words of Hitler himself - the product of a toxic upbringing who hides his fear and pain from his sweetheart, drops vaguely Social Darwinist asides like ""the old and the weak are doomed"", and deals with most problems via an overwhelming show of force, albeit prefaced here and there with a dash of stealth. It's credible that, in another telling of this tale, he'd be on the other side of the line, rubbing elbows with the Klansters you'll come across in the game's Galveston level, a sickeningly wholesome middle American town, or chatting with a fellow SS officer about the Fuhrer's purge of Hollywood rather than creeping up behind the pair, axe in hand. It doesn't exactly reassure that all of BJ's weapons and equipment are on extended loan from the Germans. Or that the game's Nazis are obsessed with him, partly because every self-respecting propaganda regime needs a colourful bogeyman, but also you sense, because like recognises like. This comes across most strongly in a tremendous sequence aboard a space station near Venus, when an undercover BJ must rehearse for the starring role in a film about his own exploits as ""Terror Billy"" - an opportunity to deconstruct his own legend before scouring the planet's surface for secret codes. Tucked away in the canteen aboard your submarine, meanwhile, you'll find a Nazi-developed version of the original Wolfenstein 3D which pits the upstanding ""Elite Hans"" against leftwing insurgents and Red Army soldiers, its pixelated walls adorned with Terror Billy's nightmarish portrait. There is a complexity to the game's interrogation of what separates heroes from monsters that is, alas, often undercut by its portrayal of the monsters themselves - smarmy, pantomime goose-steppers who exist simply to be hated, run down and gruesomely dispatched.As you may have deduced from the fact that I'm only just getting round to the gunplay, The New Colossus is least fascinating as a shooter, though it's a pretty decent shooter nevertheless. Like the New Order, it's a blend of brutality and smarts that accommodates peek-shooting but is also fiendishly geared to keep you moving. One way it does this is by seeding larger map layouts with one or two radio officers, who'll summon reinforcements endlessly until you chase them down. You can do this by stealth, using a distance indicator to corner each sentry before ravaging the grunts, but a shortage of HUD aids (e.g. viewcones) makes it hard to escape detection for long, and in any case, it's more entertaining just to open fire.The numerical health and armour system feels archaic to begin with, not least because a lack of cinematic feedback means you often won't realise that you're at death's door, but proves masterful in the long run. Health can be extended beyond the maximum by overdosing on medical packs, but drips away slowly, a mechanic that forces you to hurry onwards if you want to benefit from the extra endurance. Armour, meanwhile, can be blasted from the bodies of opponents and scooped up in passing, allowing you to top up your supply by galloping across the killzone. It's a recipe for gunfights that, as in 2016's DOOM, hinge on brinkmanship - drilling through advancing columns with dual shotguns blazing, or waddling about in the open with a heavy weapon such as the sizzling LaserKraftWerk, hoping that you'll flash-fry the mob before they bring you down. There are blemishes - the game never quite makes it clear which objects you can climb over - and there are too many metallic corridors or grubby warehouse environments for comfort, but the fundamentals of combat are, by and large, terrific.All of this is supported by an approach to unlocks that might be my favourite in a shooter, mostly because you don't have to pay it any attention whatsoever. Perform certain feats, such as killing an enemy while your health is overcharged, and you'll fill a little XP wheel, unlocking passive perks that make those feats easier to execute. If you want to dig into a particular tactic, in other words, be it headshots or setting robots on fire, all you need do is play that way to reap the benefits. It's Personalised Search Results: The FPS. There are also weapon upgrade packs that must be tracked down in the world, with around three add-ons per gun. The options here aren't surprising - think larger magazines, rocket ammo for a launcher, or an EMP effect to your grenade - but they're diverse and cleverly applied. You can equip a silencer for the pistol and SMG, for example, but not your long-range rifle, so the game never becomes an exercise in sniping.Between firefights you'll rove BJ's submarine base, allowing the squelch of Nazi viscera and the thunder of projectiles to ebb away as you hang out with your decidedly motley crew - Polish resistance fighters, Black Panthers, New Yorkers, Harvard scholars, drawling Southerners and chirping Brits. As involved as BJ's story becomes, especially once a mid-game twist kicks all that early, manly angst to the curb and ushers in some eccentric new abilities, it's these people that keep you plugging away to the finish. There's Grace, the black power activist who, in one scene, treats you to a withering rebuttal of the use of ""balls"" as a metaphor for courage while breast-feeding a child. There's Sigrun, a former Nazi who is the centre of a conversation about fat-shaming, and Max Hass, a mentally impaired man whose psychedelic crayon doodles slowly flower across the ship's hull. There is a room containing a pig and a disco ball. Some of the best moments in the game are, in fact, scenes in which BJ is merely an onlooker - fully motion-captured encounters between characters that are stumbled on as you explore, and which are borderline essential in order to get the most out of the main story.The tone is, admittedly, all over the place, poignant one moment, puerile the next, and the size of the cast also means that no character thread is properly developed, but even the likes of BioWare or CD Projekt could take lessons from the range and dexterity of this game's writing. Once you've polished off the 10-15 hour campaign you can persist aboard the sub, whiling away a few hours tracking down Nazi obercommandos in locations you've already visited using the Enigma machine, and carrying out a small selection of standalone story missions. You can also replay the campaign to explore a variant of the story that hinges on a choice during the prologue, and to try your arm on different unlocks.The New Colossus is a game that straddles moods and periods, buffoonery and biting insight, cartoon villainy and insidious real-world malevolence. It is a well-wrought FPS caught on the rocks of some marvelous, horrendous discussions about race, gender, discrimination and complicity. It is frequently crude and half-baked, mixing fart jokes with oafish interpretations of trauma, but also strikingly ambitious and a lot more intelligent than it often seems. What it needs now, I think, is a new lead and possibly even, whisper it, a change of genre. There is more to be said about a character like BJ Blazkowicz, but there is also more to be said about this universe - and our own - than is possible with BJ at the helm.

Link: Official siteDuring one cutscene in Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, a pretty serious conversation between BJ Blazkowicz and his wife Anya on their U-boat base is interrupted by someone who's just finished using the toilet. That's the tone of the game encapsulated, really: moments of sincerity punctuated by the silliest of jokes. Like with The New Order, this is a fun wrapping for a first-person shooter where you kill many Nazis. This time Blazkowicz and his friends have gone to the Nazi-occupied USA, with the intention of teaming up with a few other resistance groups and starting a revolution. Meanwhile, Frau Engel, the unhinged villain from the first game, is on a relentless and bloody hunt for BJ. Your journey takes you to places like Manhattan, Roswell and New Orleans, where you can see the various ways in which the Nazis have imposed their rule, before shooting them all in the face.I won't say too much about the specifics of the settings in Wolfenstein 2, just because I've avoided everything about The New Colossus since its E3 reveal and enjoyed the surprise of discovering them. Most of the time you'll find yourself shooting Nazis in nondescript corridors anyway, though. One of the most memorable parts of the story is exploring a disturbing, alternate reality Roswell during a Nazi parade while Blazkowicz is disguised as a firefighter. Members of the KKK are casually walking the streets. One woman tries to kiss up to a Nazi officer, and ends up committing a faux pas that gets her reported, while one newspaper seller thinks he knows the truth about who BJ really is. The ambience of it reminded me of exploring Columbia during the opening of BioShock Infinite, or indeed Rapture in Burial At Sea: it's just world-building and triggering NPC conversations, really, but the detail and atmosphere is extraordinary. Sadly, it's the only sequence of its kind in the game, and I think a few more populated areas like this would've helped make its setting feel even more real. Your home base is expanded this time, though, which compensates: after every mission, all of your supporting characters will have new things to say, and some will offer (mostly dull, actually) little sidequests to take on. If you enjoyed the tense Frau Engel train sequence in The New Order, too, you'll be pleased to know there are a bunch more like it in The New Colossus that I found just as effective. As with the first game, you can optionally sneak around and take out all the enemies in a given area instead of going weapons free, and killing an officer will prevent further reinforcements from turning up if you're caught. The difference here is that the environments are a lot larger, and there's usually more than one way to get around, even if it's just the classic games thing of moving through a couple of vents. I managed to take out a chunk of the officers stealthily, but it definitely feels harder to do that with the scope of environments and the amount of people who can spot you within them. That's not an issue, though, because The New Colossus still has some of the best guns in any FPS game, and using them is always more fun than any of Wolfenstein's stealth interactions, despite BJ having a lovely hatchet melee takedown move.The shotgun is the standout for me, as it was in the first game. This time it's got three rotating barrels, and with the game's weapon upgrades found dotted around the world, you can make it fire from all three at once, as well as adding ricochet damage that lights up the environment. These aren't as transformational or exciting as Doom 2016's gun mods, but they still give you the feeling that your arsenal is evolving across the game. Another one I like is the nailgun upgrade for the submachine gun, which downgrades it to single fire but also makes your bullets deadlier. Combined with the suppressor, it's a pretty useful gun for quietly downing multiple enemies before they can open fire and an officer sets the alarm off. I feel like the armoury could've been a bit wackier, though: a few of the heavier guns let you fire strong laser beams and blobs of flames, and even a black hole-like orange gravitational blast. Since you can't move very fast while carrying them, though, more often than not they just make you a slow-moving target. It might've been more fun if these guns were a permanent part of your arsenal and didn't slow you down, especially as later enemies include robot dogs, mechs and robots that can blink around the environment. The variety of levels is still impressive, although it didn't dazzle me as much as The New Order did in that regard.At the start of The New Colossus, you can pick which timeline you followed in the first game, whether polite American pal Wyatt or Glaswegian pilot Fergus survived. I picked Fergus like I did in the first game, and your choice grants you use of a certain weapon: a fire-based Dieselkraftwerk if it's Wyatt, and a Laserkraftwerk in the case of Fergus, which can vapourise enemies. Who you saved also changes certain cutscenes throughout the game, which is a nice touch, even though I found Fergus's wacky adventures with his misbehaving mechanical arm and constant disagreements with resistance leader Grace Walker to be a bit much after a while. I reviewed this on my 970-equipped work PC, and on medium settings it more or less stays at 60FPS, 1050p. Increasing the settings to high gets it to 45-60, depending on the situation you're in, though it's definitely consistent enough that it's fine to play like that. Tested on another PC with a GTX 780 and an I5 4460@3.20GHz, on medium settings it sat at around 35-50FPS, 1080p. It sounds like the system requirements, which say minimum spec is for 720p, 60FPS, are spot on to me.  Settings: Bloom, resolution scaling, V-sync, motion blur, anti-aliasing, colorblind mode, FOV, lights, shadows, particles, directional occlusion, reflections, decals, image streaming, water quality, material/lightmap/image aniso filter, volumetric quality, HDR bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, DoF anti aliasing, deferred rendering, sharpening, manual scaling. New to Machinegames' Wolfenstein are contraptions, a set of abilities that BJ can acquire from the halfway point of The New Colossus. One's focused on stealth, quieting your footsteps and letting you sneak through tiny spaces. Another gives you a height boost to reach better tactical areas, while the other lets you kill enemies by ramming into them. You initially choose one, and are later given optional sidequests to pick up the others. Having tried all three, being able to turn BJ into a battering ram who can gib officers by barging into them is by far the best. In these later levels, too, you can reach new areas by running through certain types of walls, which feels badass. I wish they were in the game from the start, though. By the time you acquire a contraption, you're slightly too close to the end of the story to really get the most use out of it. There are some optional asides on top of the story, though, if you want to go back and have more fun with your growing suite of toys. Killing officers gets you enigma codes, which you can then use to unlock extra missions that take you back to previous level locations, where you're tasked with killing high-ranking Nazi officers while dealing with a slightly tougher range of enemies. I did a bunch of these, and they're a nice extra for those who want more from the game after the credits. It took me 14 hours to finish The New Colossus, while taking the time to explore environments properly and do extra missions, and depending on the difficulty, methodology and the type of player you are, I imagine it would take most people 11-16 hours. I recommend quicksaving as much as possible—the checkpointing isn't terribly generous, and firefights can go on for a while. The game's two medium difficulty settings, for experienced and casual players, are well-judged depending on the kind of challenge you're after. The variety of levels is still impressive, although it didn't dazzle me as much as The New Order did in that regard. I think the game peaks just under halfway through with Area 52, which features some large, multi-storey hangars that are particularly fun to clear out, as well as a moving train section where you're emptying out tight corridors of Nazis with a shotgun. If, like me, you were wondering how Machinegames would top the whole Nazis-on-the-moon scenario in the first game, you'll enjoy how the developer answered that, even if I found the level in question to be a slog compared to some of the earlier ones. The final chapter, meanwhile, features a battle with a couple of larger enemies that I just found arduous. I was ready for it to be over by the end. The developers take the time to expand on BJ Blazkowicz's background, which yields mixed results. The game generally has a wider tonal range than the original, touching upon racism and abuse, but it doesn't really dwell on those subjects long enough to have anything to say about them. I don't expect tons of thematic depth from a game with Wolfenstein in the title, obviously, but as it stands, they just feel like extra details to ensure the player knows the world around them is harrowing—and they didn't really register any emotional impact on me as a player either way, mainly because they feel half-explored. I've got a few other gripes, too. Climbing and jumping over bits of the environment is a pain in The New Colossus, and it feels like picking up items could be a bit slicker than it is. There's some mild texture pop-in, as well, most noticeably around your U-boat base, where your allies' little rooms are lovingly stuffed with details that reveal more about them.I'm still won over by Wolfenstein 2's variety and gunplay, though, and even if it doesn't feel as fresh to me as The New Order did in 2014, I love the escalating firefights that play out in its various mini sandboxes. I appreciate that you can find singleplayer games like this in 2017, where there's so much attention paid to details like characterisation, sound design and facial animation, on top of how wonderful the guns feel. The New Colossus is fun and funny—a decent successor that's not just more of the same. The New Colossus is a fun and frantic FPS, even if it doesn't feel quite as fresh as The New Order did.Thermaltake steps into the monitor market with a pair of gaming focused monitorsWordle today: Hint and answer for #859 Thursday, October 26Diablo 4 Rogue uses a pair of pants to one-shot its hardest bosses: 'Uber Lilith was absolutely child's play'By Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023By Morgan Park4 October 2023By Jon Bailes2 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a bold game. Not just in the way it depicts the savage violence you - as thoroughly broken hero BJ Blazkowicz - inflict on the entire Nazi army, but also in the way it tells its story and treats its players. New Colossus mixes its ‘zero-fucks-given’ design philosophy through everything it does, from the ridiculously over-the-top story and tech within it, through its characters, and right down to the pacing and design of each level, and the difficulty of each scenario in them. It’s anarchy bottled, shaken up, and sprayed liberally in your face when you dare to open it up. The results are mostly positive, but not always so.The plot sees you, as Blazkowicz (or Terror Billy to the Nazis), wake up aboard stolen U-boat Eva’s Hammer. Exhausted and wounded after the events of the first game, you can’t even walk… but that doesn’t stop you single-handedly repelling a boarding party of Nazis as their commander, Frau Engel, continues her relentless pursuit of you and the remainder of the American resistance. In this historical timeline the Nazis didn’t just win World War 2: they crushed the allies, and nuked half of the US. Perhaps that’s what makes you furious enough to murder them in swathes, even if you’re confined to a wheelchair and only have half-health. The rest of the game sees BJ taking out strategic Nazi targets to try and liberate America, and dealing with events a little closer to home.""The action is wonderfully violent, featuring guns that burst flesh and melt bone with unparalleled ferocity, all done at a pace that rarely lets up.""See, this time we find out about Blazkowicz as a person, and there are numerous call-backs to his childhood. I won’t spoil them here, but let’s just say his upbringing wasn’t the kindest, and does a great job of explaining how he turned into such a righteously furious killing machine later in life. As mentioned before, Machine Games is pulling zero punches with the depiction of BJ’s life, and while the brutality of his childhood is in keeping with the aesthetic of the rest of the game, it borders on the comically evil at times. Think of a ‘bad childhood’ stereotype, and it’s probably in here.The rest of the plot is all righteous fury, ridiculousness, and well-written monologues. Spending time with each of the game’s characters is a genuine delight, and there are some of the best one-liners in all of games to be heard. Sadly, there’s little cohesion or overarching plot keeping all the pieces in place, and it can often feel like you’re playing a series of mood-pieces tied together by the central hero. It’s not a huge deal - you’re here to murder Nazis and be entertained by the offbeat resistance characters you meet - but the shift from one level to the next can feel jarring, and could have been much better finessed. It’s an odd flaw in an otherwise exceedingly polished game.So, how is the combat? Slick and bloody. Wolfenstein 2 captures the spirit of old-school shooters perfectly, while keeping a few tricks up its sleeve to make the action fresh. Dual-wielding genuinely makes combat feel different to vanilla, single-gun use, and there some neat stealth and exploration options mixed in with all the straight-up violence. Weapons are well balanced and satisfying to use, with some genuinely creative firearms letting you literally vapourise Nazis or burn them into small, crispy chunks. In other words, the pace is always varied, and you’re unlikely to get bored while you’re actually firing a weapon or swinging a hatchet.Wow - Wolfenstein 2 went there. See the secret cameo in the game...What isn’t so great is that the signposting is poor, and levels are far from a delight to explore. Sure, areas like New York, the base underneath Roswell (seen in all the pre-release footage), and all the later levels are absolutely rammed full of collectables and weapons to snag but… they’re all very drab. Endless corridors of grey, or maze-like buildings crumbling into dreary swamps, these stages really don’t inspire me to dig out every last secret. What’s worse is that they look so samey, it’s very easy to get completely lost and spend ages backtracking before you find the way forward. Later levels do vary the colour palette a little, but they’re all on the spectrum between brown and grey. Once you’ve beaten most of the game you can head back into areas and explore them for secrets and special ‘Oberkommando’ targets, but the desire to revisit any of the stages is pretty low. Wolfenstein 2 does theoretically offer decent replay value in that respect, as there is so much to find and replay. Sadly, the drabness of the actual environments in which you fight likely means you’ll think twice before diving back in. It’s not a huge deal, as the story itself is a meaty 15-20 hours depending on how long it takes you to beat certain scenarios, so there’s heaps of value here.Speaking of repeated scenarios… there are certain sections in the New Order that I found teeth-grindingly frustrating, because Terror Billy faces such overwhelming odds in relatively tight spaces. And it’s often the relentless onslaught of enemies and the brutal checkpointing that feels the most unfair. Hey, challenge is good in a game, and the gunplay is solid enough that you don’t switch off after the 20th retry, but these sudden spikes do leave a slightly bitter taste. There are ways around some of the tougher combat sections, especially in the second half of the game, but Wolfenstein 2 rarely gives you an inch of ground cheaply - you’ve got to work for each sweet victory.What else is there to do? The list of collectables is longer than Terror Billy’s Nazi rap-sheet (although they’re largely pointless), and the hugely entertaining cast of characters all demand to be interacted with as frequently as possible when you’re roaming around the off-mission hub area, Eva’s Hammer. Each member of the resistance is uniquely smart and flawed at the same time, never predictable, always fun to watch or listen to. You can even pick up neat little side-missions from them, which can lead to decent rewards if you see them through. They’re far more interesting than replaying levels to track down Oberkommandos. And a special mention goes to main antagonist Frau Engel, who is a horrible delight. Like all good villains she’s unpredictable, vaguely deranged, and utterly insidious. One sequence mid-game is absolutely astonishing in its subtle brutality, and it casts new light on not only Wolfenstein’s plot but also the representation of all bad guys in games. Not since Vaas from Far Cry 3 have we witnessed anyone as horribly transfixing.""Wolfenstein 2 rarely gives you an inch of ground cheaply - you’ve got to work for each sweet victory""Much like Engel, everything in Wolfenstein 2 is gloriously over-the-top. That’s both this game’s strength and its weakness. The plot is ludicrous, smart, bombastic, and disgusting in equal measures, taking players to the extremes of what AAA games are capable of. Action too is wonderfully violent, featuring guns that burst flesh and melt bone with unparalleled ferocity, all done at a pace that rarely lets up. Similarly, though, the story cares so little for convention that it jumps randomly from place to place to justify its insanity. Combat occasionally loses the run of itself, punishing players a little too severely in an attempt to up the ante from previous levels and justify some of the narrative’s extravagances. So there are definite upsides and downsides to all the bombast.In all, though, Wolfenstein 2 is a great shooter, with a cast of characters the likes of which you’ve never seen before in a video game. Yes, the plot is flaky, and there are some moments - you’ll know them when you see them - that will make you shake your head in disbelief. And sure, you’ll get stuck, and you’ll curse the TV, and then… you’ll retry. The action is just that good, and you’ll always be driven to kill that next Nazi, to hear what your favourite character is going to say next, and to take your revenge on one of the most hateful antagonists to ever grace a screen. Be bold, in this boldest of games, and you’ll have a blast.Why Eddie Brock isn't Venom in Marvel's Spider-Man 2Insomniac confirms Marvel's Wolverine will take place in the same universe as the Spider-Man gamesI could never have predicted the latest management sim hit: run a hotel where death gods are cute anime girlsBy Sam Loveridge18 October 2023By Will Sawyer17 October 2023By Alex Berry17 October 2023By Tabitha Baker17 October 2023By Neil Smith16 October 2023By Emily Murray16 October 2023By Joe Donnelly16 October 2023By Jon Bailes16 October 2023By Fay Watson14 October 2023By Emily Murray13 October 2023By Benjamin Abbott13 October 2023GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Metro GameCentral,"Bethesda’s new Wolfenstein sequel is even more over-the-top than before, and it’s also one of the best shooters of the year.Wolfenstein: The New Order is one of the strangest games we’ve ever played. We say that for all sorts of reasons, and all of them are positive. One of the oddest things about it is that it took such an old and directionless franchise as Wolfenstein and turned it into something so modern and vital, while at the same time still honouring its retro origins.But it’s the game’s bizarre tone – which can instantly flit between heartfelt drama, inappropriate comedy, and violent action – which is its most distinctive feature. Buoyed by the first game’s success, developer MachineGames has become even bolder in this sequel, creating a style of storytelling as distinctive as any Hollywood auteur.Despite the alternative history setting, The New Order portrayed the horrors of Nazism from a relatively traditional historical perspective. But the rise of the alt-right, in the years since the original game’s release, has now provided a much more topical target. One that is skewered with all the precision of the game’s many and bloody weapons.Although it is the middle part of an intended trilogy Wolfenstein II requires no knowledge of the first game to enjoy. There’s a little recap at the beginning anyway, showing how the Nazis won the Second World War by using stolen technology from a Jewish secret society. The main goal of the game is to start a revolution in occupied America. Which is a problem for all sorts of reason, not least the fact that many have welcomed fascist rule – as the Ku Klux Klan roam the streets and slavery is made legal again.A lot of the dialogue is very on the nose, with phrases and arguments lifted straight from the worst corners of Reddit – and which feel worryingly authentic coming from the lips of actual Nazis. But fighting fascism is not achieved through subtlety and the game is absolutely fearless in its portrayal of racism, antisemitism, sexism, and every other kind of bigotry.You can feel a righteous anger from the developer that these things even need to be argued against, but that’s only one part of the narrative. The counterpoint to the indoctrinated cruelty of the Nazis is the deeply flawed, but very human, nature of the resistance. They range from a LSD-addicted leader to a conspiracy-obsessed ex-lawyer, while protagonist William ‘B.J.’ Blazkowicz is himself equally troubled – physically and psychologically crippled by the events of the first game and the imminent birth of his twin children.This is a first person shooter and so far all we’ve done is talk about the story, as if this was some Telltale style adventure. But it’s better than that, it’s a full-bloodied action game that has something to say and a highly entertaining way of saying it. And if the subject matter sounds grim and depressing that’s only because we’ve so far neglected to mention all the poop jokes, general absurdist comedy, and unembarrassed displays of sexuality.Wolfenstein II earns its 18-rating like no other, with uniquely honest portrayals of sex, violence, drugs use, and all the other vices of mankind. The characters aren’t realistic in a literal sense – they’re too absurd and exaggerated for that – but their virtues and failings come across as very authentic.But what makes the game all the more impressive is that the gameplay and action is just as accomplished as the storytelling. It’s not merely adequate, it’s a genuinely great first person shooter in its own right. Although MachineGames have denied it as a conscious influence, we’ve always compared the games to GoldenEye 007, as most levels are open-ended and filled with secrets and extra objectives. There’s also a strong emphasis on stealth, although in most cases it’s entirely optional.The gunplay itself is second only to Destiny and each of the overpowered weapons is hugely entertaining to use, with a great sense of weight and power given to every shot. Especially now that you can dual wield any combination of guns you want. Each weapon can be upgraded with various useful extras, but unusually you’re also free to take back the upgrade points and use them in a different configuration.We’ve played a lot of first person shooters in our time but we’ve never had so much fun with a laser as in this game, it’s thick beam of light melting Nazi war machines in the most satisfying way imaginable. But all of the weapons are great, and so too are the strange special abilities you’re eventually given access to. These include being able to smash through walls and using a pair of stilts to gain higher ground. Which in keeping with the tone of the storytelling sounds ridiculous on paper but works extremely well in practise.The game’s not perfect though and the more focused narrative and deeper characterisation creates an even more difficult juggling act than in the original, and it’s not one the sequel always maintains. Blazkowicz’s sudden obsession with a character from the first game seems to come out of nowhere, and although the game happily employs cliched motivations and character traits to make a point it can come across as so hokey it undermines the drama.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationThe graphics are generally very good, but the backdrops seem strangely interchangeable considering how often you switch locations. There’s an awful lot of grey-looking corridors seemingly wherever you go, which is a shame as the actual level design is excellent, with tons of secrets to discover. (As well as a whole alternate timeline to play through, depending on a choice you make right at the beginning.)Wolfenstein II is very hard by default, with no recharging health and only limited medikits. But that’s not a failing, and the game is perfectly happy for you to drop the difficulty level for a spell and then raise it again without penalty. You can also manually save at any point.MachineGames’ Wolfenstein trilogy is one of the most important storytelling achievements this generation. Not just in the way it tells its story, but the things it’s willing to portray and the issues it tackles. Wolfenstein II would be compelling even if the combat was awful, but the fact that it’s as good as it is makes this an unmissable experience on par with almost any other game this year. A new colossus indeed.In Short: Some of the most fearless and idiosyncratic storytelling ever seen in a video game, married to one of the most viciously entertaining shooters of the generation.Pros: Incredibly assured story elements that tackle serious subjects and toilet humour with equal aplomb. Excellent combat, augmented by optional stealth and non-linear exploration.Cons: The wildly shifting tone sometimes struggles to connect, and some plot points don’t quite work as intended. Samey visuals fail to complement the excellent level design.Score: 9/10

Game Informer,"Wolfenstein: The New Order was a bold, flawed attempt to reinvent the first-person shooter that kickstarted the genre. Taking place in an alternate history where the Nazis won the war, long-time protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz tried to take back the world with the help of resistance fighters hiding in the sewers of Berlin. Though the run-and-gun gameplay was satisfying, The New Order shined through its story, focusing on a diverse cast of people trying to hold on to scraps of hope and love. The sequel, The New Colossus, trades the somber tone to become a tale of fury and uprising, and in doing so emerges as both one of the best first-person shooters and narrative-driven games I’ve ever played.The New Colossus kicks off on a grim note, with B.J. awaking crippled after the events of the first game. You are in the middle of the action almost immediately, roaming around a U-boat in a wheelchair and blasting Nazis as you go. From there, the game gets zanier and more ambitious. I rode a giant mechanical fire-breathing dog of death chasing armored troops down the streets of New Orleans. I infiltrated an airship with the power to level a city. The New Colossus is constantly upping the ante and making the most of the locations you visit, like Reich-occupied Roswell, where the Ku Klux Klan walk arm-in-arm with Nazis and talk about the importance of Americans taking their German lessons. These sequences create a compelling world, going to great lengths to sell the horrifying nature of the Nazi regime’s iron-like grip on America. From detailed and beautiful propaganda adoring walls to background sequences with characters talking amongst themselves about their struggles and secrets, Wolfenstein II goes all-in on making its terrifying world a breathing place filled with atrocities and towering, architectural wonders. The levels range from satisfying to astounding, requiring you to constantly change tactics. The long, winding tunnels and catacombs of fallout-laden New York allow you to sneak with ease as you take down hazmat-suit wearing Nazis, but the open streets of New Orleans require more thought. You can still sneak if you want, and I often ducked through entire areas without killing a Nazi, but explosive environmental traps and hollowed out buildings also give you great offensive tactical options to work with if you want blazing firefights. The more impressive, standout levels I won’t discuss for spoiler reasons, but I will say that one of them clearly draws inspiration from The Wizard of Oz and is something that has to be experienced to be believed. The New Colossus matches the variety of its settings with frenzied and flexible action. The gunplay is satisfying, and all the weapons – from your handy Maschinepistole to large laser canons – have their own distinct personality and feel powerful. Both the perks system and the dual-wielding mechanic return from The New Order, but they’ve been expanded. You are awarded more perks (like increasing the number of hatchets you can carry) as you kill Nazis in various creative ways. Constantly seeing my progression go up for each perk was nice, helping build a sense that I was becoming more powerful bit by bit. The dual-wielding mechanic now lets you use any two weapons together. During one level, I managed to sneak through it efficiently with a silenced machinegun in one hand and a pistol in the other, mowing down foes like a stealthy madman. In another, I cleared out an entire hallway with a shotgun in one hand and then picked off the enemies at the far end with a sniper rifle. In the end, I was impressed with how the dual-wielding functioned as more than just an homage to ludicrous ‘80s action movies, but also as something with tactical merit. The biggest addition to the gunplay is the upgrade system. Weapon kits are scattered throughout all the levels of the campaign, with each one letting you access one of three upgrades on every weapon in your arsenal. The system has no restriction, so you can put your kits toward putting silencers on your guns if you want to focus more on stealth gameplay, or increasing rate of fire if you want to go loud from the get-go. While you can’t sneak through the entirety of the game, you can through the majority of it if you want. I loved every moment of the campaign as I blew through Nazis and robots with shotgun blasts and quietly lopped off heads from the shadows. You also get to choose between three superpowers halfway through the game, each of them with their own advantages. I won’t go into too much detail about them since that’s getting into spoiler territory, but they’re all fun to use and also give you an emergency exit in most situations should you find yourself overwhelmed. This wealth of upgrades and unlockables are fun to use and gives you surprisingly flexibility. The New Colossus is intense and adaptable no matter which playstyle you choose, which puts it above the vast majority of other first-person shooters, contemporary and classic. Wolfenstein II constantly finds ways to turn things up to 11, but that is only half of its magic. The other half is rooted in its storytelling. The New Order presented a memorable cast of characters, then gave them time to shine between missions as you roamed a small hub world. The New Colossus has the same setup, with you and your crew aboard the U-boat that functions as your base, but also devotes more time to letting you chat with allies or do missions for them that reward you with perks. Returning characters, like Scottish pilot Fergus and mystic scientist Set Roth, are made even more interesting as they take on traumas and forge new relationships. Newcomers, like charismatic leader Grace and Nazi turncoat Sigrun (who desperately tries to win the approval of her new community), leave a lasting impression with their arcs.  Even the villain, nefarious and evil-to-the-core Frau Engel is so terrifying and deliciously cruel that her thin characterization doesn’t distract too much. The U-boat quickly became one of my favorite hub worlds in the entirety of games, with the ship feeling more like a home filled with a family of lovable characters leaning on each other while facing life’s hardships than a base. And let there be no mistake: These are people who have had their souls forced through the grinder. The New Colossus does not shy away from tough themes but, on the contrary, aggressively pursues them. The 14-hour campaign tackles racism, being complicit in cruelty, executions, child abuse, despair, patricide, the holocaust, white supremacy, and terrorism. While these themes are dark, the game handles them well, giving a proper amount of drama and emotional depth to each while also refusing to offer easy answers to the questions that plague the characters’ hearts. However, this parade of tragedy is never too much to bear, because the game takes the time to throw in wacky humor, like when machines are zapping Nazis into a fine red goop while Set Roth explains to B.J. just how broken his body is. You also see heartfelt moments of romance and friendship among the crew; amongst all the murder and sorrow, The New Colossus makes room for love and hope. Where these brands of tragedy and comedy might mix as well as water and oil in other games, here they are necessary parts to making this experience work as a cohesive whole. When I finished my playthrough, I sat watching the credits roll with a huge grin on my face, quite convinced I hadn’t played a better first-person shooter in years. I’ll keep coming back for a long time thanks to bountiful epilogue missions, plus an alternate-timeline playthrough that grants access to another side character, scenes, and weapons. But these things are just gravy. On its own merits the campaign is unbeatable, packed to the gills with unforgettable story moments and fantastic combat sequences. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a bold game that rages and soars, deftly balancing pulp sci-fi with deadly seriousness, and one that should not be missed by anyone interested in the power of storytelling in video games.

   on November 3, 2017 at 3:26PM PDTAbove all else, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus takes a very hard stance on the righteousness of killing Nazis. It never falters, not once asking whether violent resistance is the wrong way to fight back against oppression--and the game is stronger for it. The series' tongue-in-cheek attitude provides a respite from both the horrors of the Reich and the frustration of throwing yourself against its all-powerful war machine. And despite some heavy-handed moments that feel like missteps in its message, satisfying Nazi-killing action bolsters its completely bonkers storyline in a way that only Wolfenstein can achieve.The New Colossus picks up right after the events of The New Order, and unsurprisingly, our hero Blazkowicz is in bad shape. Following the explosion during the fight with Deathshead, BJ's insides are falling out, and the crew of the Kreisau Circle does their best to put him back together again. General Engel tracks them down five months later, and as her troops storm the resistance's stolen U-boat (Eva's Hammer, your base of operations), Blazkowicz wakes up to shoot more Nazis.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus Video ReviewThis first mission sets the tone for the rest of The New Colossus. Bound to a wheelchair, his organs failing, Blazkowicz feels oddly vulnerable. You shoot with one hand and slowly wheel yourself through Eva's Hammer's corridors with the other. The odds seem impossible. But overcoming them is gratifying in a way that simply killing all the Nazis can't match. Even after the Da'at Yichud armor from The New Order gives Blazkowicz his mobility back, his labored breathing reveals a man who is running out of fuel--and time.On top of that, the game is just generally difficult. You'll probably die often. Defeating a giant fire-breathing robot dog doesn't seem feasible at first, but it is with the right combination of weapons, strafing, taking cover, and scrounging for health and ammo while on the run. Part of that struggle is finding a combat style that works for you and sticking with it, whether it's a guns-blazing or more tactical approach. Some particularly punishing fights or an disadvantageous autosave can be frustrating, but most levels end just before that frustration can turn to anger.Most missions are broken up into rooms with one or two commanders who are capable of calling for reinforcements. You can choose to just shoot your way through waves of enemies, or you can try to take out the commanders quietly before addressing the rest of the room. Things escalate quickly when heavy enemies show up, since it's difficult to take them out quietly. Enemy variety and multiple paths through any given area mean you'll be rewarded with a thrilling fight regardless of how you decide to tackle it.You'll also be rewarded with more power. Successfully executing a certain number of stealth takedowns, for example, unlocks a perk that increases your movement speed while crouched. And using upgrade parts you can occasionally find lying around to, say, put a silencer on your pistol will further improve your stealth ability. But you're afforded the flexibility to decide mid-mission that stealth is not going to work and change tactics. As a result, every encounter is incredibly tense, since you never know when you're going to need to take it slow or book it to safety as bullets fly by.The far-future technology of the Nazi regime is both exhilarating to partake in and a grotesque display of their ruthless subjugation of all corners of the world. High-powered laser weapons are exciting to use, but the armored machine-men who drop them are a reminder of human experimentation during and after the war. Anything is possible in Wolfenstein, and that's a direct result of immense human suffering.Most environments in The New Colossus showcase the brutal, industrial truth of the Reich, like the twisted remains of a post-nuke New York City. But there are also appearances to be kept up, and the Roswell level in particular provides the rest of the picture. You arrive in Roswell during a parade, and the sunny, idyllic streets are peppered with Nazi officers and Klansmen in their full regalia. Well-dressed citizens speak in German as they celebrate--or pretend to celebrate--the Nazi takeover, propaganda books and posters in view. It's unnerving and threatening to see the way the occupied, but not destroyed, cities operate under Nazi rule, as well as to see and overhear people willfully ignoring the atrocities around them.Aside from being a much-needed break from fighting, the story cutscenes are beautifully directed and take advantage of the game's fantastic cast of characters. The Roswell parade section, for example, ends with an Inglorious Basterds-esque interaction with a commandant that is at once funny and upsetting, a careful balance that The New Colossus strikes throughout. Some gameplay-to-cutscene-to-gameplay transitions are a little jarring, but it's easy to get swept back up in the combat or the story right away.The story cutscenes are beautifully directed and take advantage of the game's fantastic cast of characters.Proper cutscenes as well as idle chitchat on Eva's Hammer reveal intimate details about even minor characters. Each person on the U-boat has their own story of oppression and marginalization, from the Black Panthers to General Engel's anti-Nazi daughter, Sigrun. But they're also just people; some are depressed, some are angry, some are horny, and nearly all of them will have their own conversations on the U-boat that you can listen in on whenever you want. You can watch as everyone shuns Sigrun at lunch (perhaps rightfully so) and listen as New York resistance fighters discuss the nuclear tragedy. Even when the story goes completely off the rails--in an absolutely jaw-dropping way--there's still room to explore their individual dynamics. It's a small thing, but it keeps you invested in the crew and their cause.There are times when The New Colossus overreaches for poignancy, and as a result it states its themes too overtly instead of letting them stand alone. Shows of American patriotism, like a particular monologue about liberty and freedom, feel misguided after flashbacks that show the rampant racism in the America of BJ's childhood. The idea that America had problems before the Nazis showed up is there, and it's powerful, but it's obscured by seemingly conflicting ideas.And while arguments over the purpose of the war and inspirational speeches about fighting against impossible odds show the breadth and depth of the resistance movement, for the most part these are things you can discern just from playing normally. Of course you should keep fighting against the Nazis, even when it seems pointless; after all, overcoming their unstoppable might mission after mission is satisfying enough on its own to keep you going.The New Colossus never lets you forget who and why you're fighting. Nazi brutality is on full display, from the blown-out, irradiated remains of Manhattan to each of the resistance members, who all carry mental scars if not physical ones. You're never given a chance between cutscenes, missions, and even downtime on the U-boat to lose sight of the Reich's cruelty. Wolfenstein's tense gameplay elevates this further by giving you the power to truly resist--and come out of each battle ready for another fight. Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:This sequel successfully builds on what made its predecessor greatIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus begins with the father of B.J. Blazkowicz, the hero of the franchise. Blazkowicz is a child, and he’s about to learn the extent of his father’s hatred after being caught playing with a young friend. A young female friend. A friend who is black.This is the world of the straight white man, according to the elder Blazkowicz. They are superior to other races, religions and sexual orientations. “It’s on us to straighten out the queer,” he tells his son. The younger Blazkowicz has to learn how to be strong, a lesson his father believes wasn’t being taught by the boy’s Jewish mother. This is why B.J. finds himself with his hands tied to a beam, looking at his dog. He’s handed a shotgun. He has to learn how to be strong, you see.The scene doesn’t resolve until you pull the trigger.Wolfenstein 2’s shocking opening scenes drive home the cruelty of its characters. It’s not enough to be racist; the elder Blazkowicz also has to be an anti-Semite who only married a Jewish woman for the connection to her family business. Then he kicks a dog, and then forces B.J. to kill the dog. In a few short minutes, we’re re-introduced to another evil character who kills a resistance fighter in cold blood. And then plays with the dead rebel’s head. All this in a mere 10 minutes.The New Colossus will show you amazing, surreal sights during its single-player campaign. That campaign is the game, for better or worse, and developer MachineGames wasn’t nervous about creating something that would make people talk. There is horrific violence, but there is also a Nazi soldier quizzing members of the Ku Klux Klan about their German lessons.The Klan, you see, was pretty happy to work with the Nazis in the Southern states in this alternate history. As B.J.’s dad said, you can make a pretty good life for yourself if you play by their rules. So why not go along to get along? Inform on your neighbors. Give up family members. Make a good name for yourself. It’s a white man’s world, after all. And it turns out that a lot of white men in America are happy to take it back, even if it means working with the Reich. If its beginning is oppressive and brutal, Wolfenstein 2 often feels strangely unforgiving in its embrace of violence and joyous in its embrace of humanity — even if that humanity is forced to exist in the cracks of the new world order. B.J. Blazkowicz is a sort of super soldier, a near-legendary fighter who woke up in 2014’s Wolfenstein: The New Order after a 14-year coma to a world where the Axis powers won World War II. He joined the resistance against the Nazis, and that last game ended with him setting off a nuclear weapon and, presumably, dying.That death didn’t take, however. Blazkowicz may be physically and emotionally ruined at the beginning of The New Colossus, but that state doesn’t last very long. He’s back to picking up a gun and fighting back before you know it, even if that introduction to the character isn’t the only time in the game he’ll suffer incredible physical harm. His nurse and romantic interest from the last game, Anya, is now pregnant with twins. He has more to fight for, in other words, and that drive is needed in a conflict where the United States has fallen to Nazi rule.Anya’s pregnancy doesn’t stop her from fighting, of course. The sight of her naked form, swollen with child and covered in blood, her face an ecstatic rictus of pleasure, is just one of many impossible moments in the game. She’s there to help her friends and kill some Nazis, and if she has to do so while temporarily topless, so be it. She’s happy in her work.Wolfenstein 2 strikes a difficult but satisfying balance between joy and despair. It illustrates both how violent and hateful the U.S. has become under Nazi rule, as well as well as how those who fight back celebrate their victories — often by having sex and getting high. This is why people are willing to fight back: Life can be enjoyable, and it’s important to enjoy it. In the time between missions, you can explore the resistance’s base and pick up a few side tasks, which do a good job of fleshing out Blazkowicz’s allies. These are people who fight because they’re alive, but they have a life outside of the battle, whether their hobby is practicing clarinet or dabbling in psychedelics. The moments of quiet and relative peace that happen between the gunfire are welcome, and that sense of rhythm and even pacing helps to elevate The New Colossus as an action game.All of this messy, vibrant spirit exists around a game that’s pleasingly retro. Wolfenstein 2’s levels are large enough to provide different paths forward and reward exploration. It felt wonderful to fight through areas that rewarded my curiosity in poking around or my creativity in how I attacked enemies.Blazkowicz carries his entire arsenal with him, so you can choose which gun goes in which hand at any point, or put the same gun in each hand, should you decide to dual-wield. There are weapon upgrade kits scattered around your base and each level, allowing you to add scopes, silencers, extended magazines or other attachments to your guns. Later additions to Blazkowicz’s abilities will also help shape how you fight, and I never felt judged by going in hot with two guns blazing or by choosing stealth and doing things with quick, clean kills. The New Colossus feels like it welcomes multiple playthroughs where you try to do things a different way, or take a different path with your upgrades and loadout selections. I was also asked to make a narrative decision early in the game that changed certain aspects of the story. I want to play through at least once more to see everything there is to see.That attitude of giving the players plenty of options exists throughout the game. The New Colossus features checkpoints, but you can also save or load at any point if you want to save-scum your way across a battlefield, or simply want to try a new approach while knowing you won’t have to go all the way back to a checkpoint if you fail. You can raise or lower the difficulty level at at will, and there is no reward or penalty for doing so. The New Colossus isn’t fussy about how you play, and this inviting attitude makes the experience feel welcoming, like a narrative that the game’s creators truly want players to get through. I would often bump the difficulty down if I became frustrated at a particularly difficult battle, only to crank it back up if I felt like I was skating around too easily. The game doesn’t chide you for rolling your own difficulty level on an encounter-by-encounter basis.That’s not to say that Blazkowicz’s adventure is a walk in the park. The New Colossus stumbles a bit in communicating how much damage you’re taking. The combination of the weak rumble effects in the PlayStation 4 controller and the lack of stronger auditory or visual feedback often gave me the suggestion that I was taking more damage than I actually was. It took a while to learn when I was really in trouble and how to get out of it quickly.The New Colossus often felt like one long invitation to have a good time, regardless of whether I was playing the game the way the developers seemingly intended. Though strange in some ways, this sort of open-ended design was surely part of the plan. It’s a game that frequently felt like a toy, which is an odd but not horrible feeling in an experience this uncompromisingly violent.And, oh, it is violent. The New Colossus offers plenty of ways to destroy your enemies using a variety of distinct and interesting guns. There’s also the ax, which comes complete with a large selection of grisly death animations and rewards for sneaking up behind the Nazi soldiers and taking them out quietly.You can dual-wield if you want to put a lot of lead into someone very quickly, and you can upgrade your weapons in strategic ways to reinforce your preferred fighting style. Gunfights in the game are chaotic, booming affairs complete with explosions and charging enemies that can knock you flat on your ass, literally, and it’s all set to the grinding guitar-focused metal work of Mick Gordon.Wolfenstein 2 is a thudding, explicitly violent game that doesn’t mind looking into the heart of the people involved in this war. Without going into too much spoilery detail, this is one of the few action games that plays with the idea of what would happen if the hero was to be held accountable for the hundreds, if not thousands, of people he killed in the name of what’s “good.” Those henchmen and henchwomen have parents and partners and kids somewhere. The New Colossus doesn’t shy away from this reality.And that’s the strength of this sequel. It balances a steady stream of suffering and hurt with exuberant humanity. It deals with our darkest impulses and our best, and plays them both up to a ridiculous degree. There’s nothing subtle about Wolfenstein 2, but it’s all affecting in a way that makes the game feel special and coherent. There are moments in the game that made my heart swell, while others were so grisly I had to look away.B.J. is comfortable killing thousands upon thousands of his enemies if they stand between him and a bit of peace. But killing isn’t all that Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus offers. It’s the rare first-person shooter that explores the first time its hero pulled a trigger; it’s the rare first-person shooter that is comfortable connecting with the primal, untamed parts of your brain while celebrating just how fucking good it feels to lay out a Nazi.Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus was reviewed using final “retail” PlayStation 4 code provided by Bethesda.

Kotaku,"The warm sun beats down on a main street in Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, just in time for the Victory Day parade. Uniformed SS march down swastika-filled streets to thunderous applause. By the old diner, two members of the Ku Klux Klan practice their German. Everyone is white and happy. And it is so fucked up.Wolfenstein 2 is set in world where the Nazis won World War II. In 2014’s Wolfenstein: The New Order, protagonist William “BJ” Blazkowicz is injured during a mission against a Nazi scientist near the end of the war and spends 14 years in a coma. He wakes up  in the Nazi-conquered present of 1960and eventually strikes back at the scientist he failed to kill during the war. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus picks up right where the previous title left off, with BJ bleeding out. Awakening five months later, he continues his crusade against the Nazis, joining with resistance groups in America to start a revolution.Weaving together scenes of rural Americana and dystopian fascism, The New Colossus’ world is nightmarish. A memorable stroll through suburban New Mexico streets features Nazis side by side with the Ku Klux Klan, while a sojourn into New York, long since irradiated from a Nazi atom bomb, is evocative and dark. The most terrifying aspect of America is just how much the populus has embraced their new overlords, spewing forth nationalist rhetoric and supplicating to the Reich. The world has fully embraced the Nazis, and it’ll take a huge kick in the teeth to knock them out of it. Which is where the gunplay comes in.The New Colossus plays best when it is angry. While BJ is fragile and can be taken down with a few shots, he has a great deal of mobility and a diverse arsenal for killing Nazis. Machine pistols and assault rifles spew forth bullets with reckless abandon while powerful laser weapons burn enemies to skeletal dust. The New Colossus liberally hands out ammunition and plenty of foes to use it on. The gunplay shares a similar rhythm to 2016’s Doom, punctuating the shooting with gruesome melee kills, though it never quite hits the same confident stride.  BJ slides, leaps, blasts, and hacks off limbs with a responsiveness that reduces Nazis into little more than bloody pinatas fit to burst at the next shotgun blast. “Terror Billy” earns his name.1981’s Castle Wolfenstein placed an emphasis on stealth and disguise that the series has never managed to completely replicate. The New Order successfully implemented sneaking segments with diverging paths and key assassination targets. They were occasionally prone to breaking down as enemies discovered the player, but many of them could be cleared with nothing but a knife and some grit. The New Colossus keeps these segments but lacks the varied level design that helped them shine so much in The New Order.  Many of the game’s spaces are claustrophobic and tight; they offer limited pathways and unpredictable enemy patrols. When everything works, stealth sequences are a brutal display of guerilla warfare but those moments are rare. Players are far more likely to stumble into an alert and trigger a massive gunfight.""These are our woods.""Emma Lazarus FanfictionCompelling setting, furious gun fights, clever writing, lots of Nazis to punch.Stealth segments can be clumsy, underwhelming level design, mid-game upgrades come a bit too late, somewhat perfunctory sidequests.Playstation 4 and PC (Played), Xbox OneOctober 27thCompleted the main campaign in about ten hours. Immediately started a new playthrough so I could enjoy it again.In the second half of the game, BJ gains access to numerous Nazi combat rigs that dramatically alter both gunfights and exploration. The player can choose from one of  three tools, though the other two can be found in the game. Instantly deployable stilts create new angles of attack and boost players to balconies. A constriction rig allows BJ to slide into small crevices and sneak around the battlefield like a Nazi-killing Ant Man. Massive charging armor can be used to bowl enemies over like pins or bash through weak walls. The rigs dramatically change the game, expanding level exploration to match immersive sims like Deus Ex or Dishonored. The New Colossus’ levels dance a thin line between self-contained arenas and a larger open world, and the introduction of these new upgrades allow creative approaches to problems that were previously tackled with less finesse.The New Colossus manages to get a great deal of mileage from only a few key locations thanks to a loose mission structure. While the majority of the game focuses on moving from one plot point to the next, BJ can also carry out requests for side characters in missions or at home base. By collecting Enigma Cards from downed Nazi commanders, BJ can use the base’s Enigma machine to unlock extra assassination missions. These side missions lend a grander sense of gravity the game. BJ is part of an insurgency fighting a massive occupying force, and thinning the Nazi ranks is hard work. These missions can be played at any time once the Enigma Machine is unlocked, and it’s likely only the most determined players will complete these extra tasks.The New Colossus strikes a balance between high action pulp and self-reflection. The narrative tackles heavier thematic concerns while still finding time for cheesy dialog and offbeat humor. In spite of Bethesda’s insistence that the game in not meant as specific political commentary, The New Colossus has things to say about the nature of violence and autocratic power although this is sometimes in spite of a whiplashed presentation. The resistance is a diverse band of socialists, ex-jarheads, black liberationists and civil rights activists, exiled Jews, and anarchists banding together against the fascist regime. BJ’s all-American patriotism lives side by side with Christian liberation rhetoric and anti-capitalism. Whereas the Nazis strive for a monolith of identity and ideology, the resistance is intersectional and energetic.There is no ignoring the context of The New Colossus’ release. Fascism and nationalist violence is on the rise across the world. As I finished The New Colossus this weekend, Nazis and other white nationalist groups marched across Tennessee. A group of them entered a Brentwood pub and attacked a biracial couple. The Nazis in The New Colossus are broad caricatures, dark armored soldiers with robotic dog-tanks and deadly laser cannons. But the underlying truth of the Nazis, the hate festering in their hearts, endures to this day. The New Colossus examines this hatred through its pulp storytelling and bloody gunplay, as well as in the toll the resistance takes on its cast. This is a game that wants to show players all the things that can be done with a hatchet and some Nazis but also wants to understand why someone would take up the hatchet to begin with.Nowhere is this more clear than with BJ himself. The game’s opening focuses on his broken home life in great detail. While he spends most of the game shooting Nazis, BJ also struggles to understand his past and finds just as much racism and hatred in his upbringing as within the halls of the Reich’s power. While The New Colossus has plenty of exciting gunfights, they grow bittersweet as we see the human and emotional toll the mere act of existence takes on BJ. He is trapped in a cycle, thrust into a life of violence by a cruel father and driven deeper and deeper into depravity by the unchecked cruelty of his oppressors.In spite of this, The New Colossus is not joyless. The game balances its protagonist’s internal struggles and broader examinations of violence with some wonderful sci-fi schlock. There are psychedelic drug trips, a Frakenstein’d cat with the body of squirrel monkey, flying saucers, and more. This wackiness mixes with personal moments: birthday parties, nervously-composed love letters, and long conversations about which boy band member is the cutest. The New Colossus is violent and stark, but it also manages to be funny and human. Every new scene offers fresh surprises.The New Colossus’ greatest trick is its malleability. At any given moment, the game transforms to provide new experiences. Gameplay ebbs and flows between stealth and action, ramping up tension with new abilities and weapons. It is an old-school action game, a tense stealth experience, and an immersive sim all at once. The story moves from pure sci-fi camp to dark and pained trauma but always manages to make each moment feel equally believable. Wolfenstein is a chameleon befitting its lineage. The Apple II games were subtle and grounded; id Software’s classic 1992 shooter was fast and bloody. The New Colossus is both of these things and more, moving from moment to moment with confidence.The New Colossus crafts a world that can deliver exciting action and human drama. The messy gunfights give way to something much larger. The New Colossus examines violence, resistance, and the necessity of revolution. It’s bloody and occasionally silly but never stupid or crass. It comes down firmly on the side of punching Nazis and throwing bricks, concluding that such resistance isn’t just cathartic but essential. "
USgamer,"To endure amongst the living.This article first appeared on USgamer, a partner publication of VG247. Some content, such as this article, has been migrated to VG247 for posterity after USgamer's closure - but it has not been edited or further vetted by the VG247 team.Spoiler Warning: This review contains spoilers for the previous game in MachineGames' Wolfenstein series, Wolfenstein: The New Order.When we last left William J. ""BJ"" Blazkowicz, the dude was at the brink of death. He was bleeding out, as a helicopter of all his loved ones flew away to safety. If this weren't a video game, it'd be safe to assume that he died there, dreaming of his imaginary white picket fence life. A life without Nazis in power.But this is a hyper-fictional world where Nazis won World War II, and BJ Blazkowicz remains an unkillable human machine. His dance with death reminds us that he's still vulnerable, mirroring the opening hours of his last outing, Wolfenstein: The New Order. Yet instead of sitting comatose for nearly a decade, BJ sinks in and out of consciousness now for a shorter amount of time. Once again, it's the presence of Nazis that wakes him up, as if his internal Nazi Killing Sense started tingling.Nazi killing is what BJ does best. It's his raison d'être. He might as well have guns sewn into his arms like the killing machine that he is. He's tall, chiseled, with a square head and even more square torso. BJ's body was built to sustain and kill. Except in The New Colossus, now it's broken. He's confined to a wheelchair. The only way he can stand and fight as he once was is by wearing a full suit of power armor. (Not of the medieval variety, of course.) BJ can still fight, but he's the weakest he's ever been. Constantly he mutters to himself about how his time's running out. In a moment of vulnerability with his lover Anya, he worries that if he takes off his suit to shower that he'll crumble.BJ is finally fragile. But not for long.If The New Order was about BJ finding his will and strength, then The New Colossus is a game about him trying to retain it. BJ and the rest of the Kreisau Circle resistance travel to the United States of America, vowing to ignite a second American Revolution by collaborating with well-known resistance groups that operate out of the country. They always hide in plain sight. Smart mouthed Grace Walker of the Black Resistance Front (and my personal favorite of the new characters that join The New Colossus) is smack in the middle of Manhattan, their headquarters in the atom-bombed out Empire State Building. Elsewhere in New Orleans is the Proletariat Movement. Aside from the uncomfortable, KKK-controlled city of Roswell, the glimpses we get of America are mostly in ruin. When BJ visits New Orleans, it's in the midst of full obliteration by the Nazis. Manhattan looks like it's straight out of a post-apocalyptic game: a former metropolis, now heaps of rubble thanks to a nuclear bomb. That nuclear bomb, we learn, is what caused Americans to surrender to the Nazis after World War II. New York City being blown to bits changed everything for everyone. Well, except for the white Americans who became complacent to Nazi rule, according to resistance fighter Grace. But boy, are the Nazis horrified by BJ. They almost affectionately call him Terror-Billy, even erecting an arcade game in his name. (Hilariously, you can even play the arcade game—which is a reversal of roles in Wolfenstein 3D—in the main hub of the submarine Eva's Hammer, in the Club Kreisau area.) BJ's a menace that Nazis fear universally. Arriving in America, billboard-size wanted signs are posted up in his honor too. A new country to explore and a vulnerable BJ are two of the biggest changes in The New Colossus. Other shifts are of the mechanical variety expected in a sequel. Weapons are customizable now; plus axes replace knives. About half-way through the game, players can nab a ""Contraption"" according to their central playstyle: Battle Walkers, which give you long-ass stilts to walk on to reach high places or have the literal upper hand in battle; Ram Shackles are elaborate shoulder pads that let you bust through walls and bash into enemies; and the Constrictor Harness lets you squeeze into hard to fit spaces, prime for sneaking up on foes. BJ gets one Contraption in the story, but later on, side missions become available leading you to whichever two you did not choose. Also fitting to BJ's gotta-kill-'em-all mantra, you can equip two separate weapons in BJ's palms for dual wielding, such as a shotgun on the right, a pistol on the left. Whatever works best for ol' BJ.Even as the first three-fourths of The New Colossus' 12-or-so hour campaign break off at a blistering pace, the game peters off a little bit in its closing fourth. It has its moments still, and gives you additional freedom as you gain access to Ubercommander assassionation missions, additional Contrapation opportunities, and more; and yet, the main missions begin to feel more stale, with less enemy variety popping up and even lesser interesting areas to sleuth around. At least, The New Colossus doesn't skimp on replayability, so the somewhat lackluster back section doesn't have to be your final impression. Back are the intense difficulty options (all of which are dynamic, thank the lord) to offer players different levels of first-person-shooter masochism. About two-thirds of the way through the game (and post-game too), Enigma Codes become accessible. Enigma Codes are essentially assassination side missions, excuses to revisit old levels BJ's already murdered his way through for more rewards (and to kill a tad more Nazis). The targets are Ubercommanders, essentially the same commanders BJ would take out otherwise in an area, but with a twist.Also, at the very start of the game you're taken to a flashback of that dastardly choice you make in The New Order: to save Fergus or Wyatt. Saving whoever affects both a special weapon you receive early on (Laserkraftwerk versus Dieselkraftwerk) and your crew's general dynamic and cutscenes. For the sake of my first playthrough, I saved Fergus as I did in The New Order. I'm currently ankles deep in a second playthrough with a livelier, more annoying Wyatt by my side. (I already miss Fergus.)The New Colossus brings back one of the most satisfying progression systems in first-person shooters, as it was in The New Order too. A progression system that isn't about collecting ability points; that isn't relegated to a choose-your-own style of faux-currency. Instead, BJ only gets stronger in The New Colossus by successfully doing certain things repeatedly, from stealth kills to electric damage. The more BJ does something, the stronger he grows in that particular department. In the real world, people often say ""practice makes perfect."" In the world of Wolfenstein, that phrase is actually put into practice.The best parts of The New Colossus lie in the quiet though; in-between stealthing or running-and-gunning Nazi humans, Nazi dogs, and Nazi robots. It's in watching your comrades interact aboard Eva's Hammer, the stolen Nazi submarine that's now a makeshift base for the resistance. It's in doing mundane side missions, like feeding a pet pig some potatoes. It's in a surprisingly somber chapter sandwiched between the typical chapters of just shooting. The New Colossus is the rare sort of shooter that sometimes even shines more when there's no guns involved at all. Especially in the friendships paved with BJ's comrades through the game's sometimes-silly pulp attitude. Especially in scenes with Anya, BJ's take-no-shit partner. A partner he doesn't need to protect, nor save. A woman who's on the front lines with a rifle just like the rest of the resistance—even with a super-pregnant, protruding belly. The New Colossus reminded me why I loved the quietly lifelike romance from the first game so much in the first place.And while the writing is as strong as ever, I suppose just shooting a Nazi until they disintegrate into a bloody dust cloud always feels kinda cool too. InterfaceI'm a big fan of its Ikea-like tutorials.Lasting AppealWolfenstein 2 feels like an exercise in how to keep players returning to your game without resorting to microtransactions or needless multiplayer. With lots of difficulties, post-game content that doesn't feel shoehorned in, collectibles, and an alternate path with slightly different cutscenes, there's many reasons to keep killin' Nazis.ConclusionWolfenstein 2: The New Colossus builds on the first game, making for another superb linear first-person shooter campaign. It's an empowering journey that BJ goes on—rising from his near death experience from The New Order to be stronger than ever, befriending others who are just as tough and ready to take back what the Nazis stole from them: their country.

Destructoid,"darkDo you remember back in 2013, when franchise reboot Wolfenstein: The New Order was first announced? Everyone was furious about the title’s marketing campaign, with many gamers taking genuine issue with the gleeful abandon in which the game’s Nazi-killing themes were represented.Oh no, wait, actually no-one gave a shit. It basically wasn’t an issue. Roll on a mere four years later and we have folk fuming over such concepts. Nazis have been getting obliterated in Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, et al for decades, no-one batted an eyelid. Yet now, suddenly, we’re supposed to start wringing our hands and applying pseudo-intellectual pontification over such matters? What happened?One of the reasons people cry foul with The New Colossus‘ marketing is because they see similarities to today’s climate (in rare cases, perhaps themselves) referenced within it. A climate that may not have seemed quite so contemporary back in 2013. The Wolfenstein narrative is a fictional tale about the successful rise of global fascism. If people want to complain that Bethesda are cheaply “exploiting current events,” then how did we let those events become current?The issue here isn’t that Bethesda chose to lampoon real-world political slogans, or genuine feelings of civil unrest, with a sly wink, in order to sell their wares. Hell, they were making these games years before such slogans were in the public zeitgeist. No, the issue lies with us folk, for allowing such a gross climate to return to a state of prominence, thus being ripe for artistic reference in the first place.But that’s barely the tip of this latest video game hot potato, another topic for another time, maybe. But right now, gather your arms brothers and sisters, ‘cos we got a Nazi regime to smash.Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (PS4 [reviewed], PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)Developer: MachineGamesPublisher: Bethesda SoftworksReleased: October 27, 2017 (PS4, PC, Xbox One), TBA (Switch)MSRP: $59.99Colossus picks up immediately where The New Order left off. Having been rescued from death’s door by his rebel family, The Kreisau Circle, Col. B.J. Blazkowicz and his motley crew of resistance fighters reunite on-board their stolen U-Boat, Eva’s Hammer. Though the Deathshead compound has been successfully obliterated, the Nazi regime remains steadfastly in power across the USA. With B.J. slowly succumbing to his fatal injuries, and a vengeful Frau Engel obsessively on their heels, The Kreisau Circle surmise that if any hope is to be had of stamping out The Reich, then America is to be liberated.A first-person-shooter in the epitome of the genre, players run ‘n’ gun their way through thousands of Nazi stormtroopers, creepy androids, and monstrous supersoldiers, armed with an array of (very) heavy artillery. From hatchets and shotguns to flamethrowers and chump-disintegrating lasers, Blazkowicz dual-wields monstrous firepower, literally vaporising the opposition en masse, in one of the most cathartic shooter experiences available. Though a stealth approach to some missions is a viable option, c’mon, we have Metal Gear for that, why not pick up that experimental matter-destroying cannon instead? Colossus, aware of its simplistic gameplay, chooses to accent its visuals, utilising some stunning light and shadow mechanics, intricate character modelling and some of the best flame, explosion, and particle physics I’ve seen in some time.While all this gung-ho Nazi-smashing action does provide a solid, pulse-pounding challenge, some elements are a bit uninspired. A few of the game’s maps are flabby and needlessly large which harms the pace of the running battle. There is also a surprising lack of enemy types too, and by the halfway point you will have seen most of the cannon fodder the game has to offer. Sadly, boss battles are pretty much non-existent, and those who enjoyed taking down the the gargantuan London Monitor from The New Order, or enjoyed the multi-stage fight with Deathshead that rounds out the same game, may be disappointed to learn that there are no such set-pieces here. As such, though the fight is an enjoyable one, the campaign lacks memorable showdowns with unique enemies, and thus becomes a tad dry by the final act.The real passion project in Colossus is the game’s high-drama, high-camp storyline, which is told in fantastic cinematic and in-engine cutscenes. The characters of the Wolfenstein universe are great; we love the heroes and despise the villains in equal measure, thanks in no small part to the game’s excellent motion-capture, strong dialogue with a hefty side of patriotic cheese, and superb voice-acting. Colossus‘ story runs a gauntlet of dark themes, including scenes of upsetting violence, vulgar hatred, and heartbreaking mental cruelty, before swiftly switching to narrative devices that wouldn’t be out of place in a Cannon Films action flick.The skill in MachineGames’ storytelling is its ability to align these ridiculously opposed elements, while still maintaining a perfect balance between taut drama and total farce. There are scenes in the game that are genuinely distressing, slotted beside brilliant, mind-blowing “What. The. Fuck?” moments. (An awesome incident, featuring Blazkowicz’s heavily-pregnant partner Anya, just has to be seen to be believed.) I could give so many examples, but who am I to ruin the surprise? Unfortunately, the game’s ending seemed slightly anticlimactic to me, and was followed by a credits theme so fucking horrible that it killed my post-game hype.Though Colossus has no multiplayer, there is some extended replay value here. Eva’s Hammer features a world map, which unlocks optional side-missions as you progress through the campaign. There are also Enigma codes to be found and decrypted, amusing tasks to perform for members of The Kreisau Circle, and a whole host of collectibles to be found. Those wanting to go full retro might enjoy “Wolfstone 3D,” an in-game recreation of the 1992 classic, with an amusing twist. These extras help add value to the 10-to-12 hour story campaign.Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a great game that has some frustrating hiccups. Its high-octane, lead-pumping action looks and feels fantastic, but does start to wear thin toward the climax. The enemy design is suitably imposing, but the range of enemies and lack of boss fights is disappointing. The storyline features excellent characters, a good script, and brilliant voice-acting, but occasionally slips into melodrama and has a somewhat lackluster finale. What Colossus does well, however, it does with genuine excellence, which helps to paper over these noticeable cracks.Part political commentary, part comic-book farce, completely batshit insane, and as primal as an FPS title can be, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is certainly recommended. It has a great cast, wicked visuals, breathless combat, and unforgettable story moments. It cannot be denied that there are flaws, and they are tough to ignore, but the game’s wanton carnage and narrative head-fuckery help slice through them as cleanly as a hatchet through a Nazi’s cranium.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

If there was a Mt. Rushmore of gaming, William “B.J.” Blazkowicz’s face would be plastered on it beside Mario, and the other founding fathers of gaming. Wolfenstein was one of the first-person shooters that laid down the foundations for what the genre has become, and B.J. is an iconic character and imminently recognizable.For many years, Wolfenstein was a fairly one-dimensional game. Nazis are evil, and you kill them. That formula got a little more involved over the years, but it wasn’t until Bethesda published Wolfenstein: The New Order that B.J. and the alternate history he lives in got a little more exposition and character. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus continues down this path, placing more importance on plot development and world-building than the last two titles in the series.When The New Colossus begins, it’s been a few months since the events at the end of The New Order. Captain Blazkowicz is battered and broken, and the Kreisau Circle resistance is on the run from the now-General Irene Engel. From the very start, you’re thrown right into the action in what is undoubtedly the most action-packed scene involving a wheelchair in gaming history.Engel has found the resistance and B.J. isn’t going to let a coma and his guts falling out a few months earlier keep him from killing Nazis. He takes to a wheelchair and machine guns his way through the invaders in traditional over-the-top Wolfenstein style. As the game continues, it switched back to the usual run-and-gun affair of the previous titles, but the mission design is good enough that it never feels old.You’re slowly introduced to new weapons and more powerful equipment through Wolfenstein 2 that can be mixed and matched in all sorts of different ways to make you a more deadly Nazi hunter. Each of your main guns has three different upgrades that do anything from adding scopes to making your rounds ricochet off of any surface your strike. The gunplay and movement are smooth, and no matter how much action, it all keeps a nice stable framerate thanks to the id Tech 6 engine on which the game was developed (the same engine that made its debut with Doom 2016).The plot, on the other hand, is a bit less cohesive than the gameplay. The goal of the Kreisau Circle this time around is to start a revolution in the United States. Once America is reclaimed, they hope to use it as a stage to free the rest of the world from Nazi tyranny. To help accomplish this goal, B.J. treks to different locations in the country to rescue resistance leaders and their cells.The tone throughout is all over the place though. B.J.’s childhood memories are dark, even for a game about Nazis, and intense domestic violence in several scenes. What makes this so weird is that five minutes later the scene may center on Super Spesh, a UFOlogist who believes aliens landed in Roswell, raving and ranting, or Fergus being a belligerent Scotsman. I appreciated the attempt to make Blazkowicz more three-dimensional, but the pacing leaves something to be desired.Fortunately, about halfway through Wolfenstein 2 drops any semblance of trying to be a poignant story and sticks with a more humorous and over-the-top narrative that fits the overall feeling of the series a lot better. The most prominent downside to The New Colossus’s plot, though, is that the primary antagonist, General Engel, isn’t used to her full potential. The sequences that do include her are stunning, and live up to the “psychotic Nazi” archetype. Unfortunately, she ends up being underutilized. While she’s an ever-present threat, you just don’t get enough interaction with her to make it feel like she’s calling the shots. Instead, it feels like you’re fighting random Nazis, as opposed to anything resulting from her machinations.For those who were hoping for a commentary on current events, politics, or racism, there’s very little here to see (more on that in a future article). What’s spoken on concerning race is quickly forgotten, and the few scenes amongst everyday Americans are typically used for comic relief as opposed to any allegorical analysis. There is a positive message though about putting aside our differences and working towards a common goal, in this case killing Nazis, and I was glad there wasn’t a bunch of drama between the resistance to detract from the overall goal of the team.On the technical side, the game exceeds The New Order and The Old Blood for the most part. I reviewed Wolfenstein 2 on the PlayStation 4 Pro, and while the visuals were crisp, some bugs still need working out. When the game switches from real-time gameplay to a pre-rendered cutscene, it just hangs sometimes. Often it’s only a short bump before the movie starts playing, but every once in awhile it almost seemed like the game had locked up before finally switching over.The audio is outstanding, except when it’s not. I played with a mid-grade 5.1 Surround Sound system with a Denon S730H A/V receiver, and when I began the game, it sounded great, making good use of all five channels. However, after a little while, I noticed that some channels would fluctuate in sound, especially the right surround speaker. I tried some other media and games just to make sure that my sound system hadn’t just started malfunctioning at random, but it seems the problem is only with The New Colossus. Towards the end of the game, there were some definite sound glitches, with music cutting out, stuttering, and some sounds in areas refusing to play. The errors always corrected themselves, and the visuals weren’t affected, but it hampered my enjoyment of the game a little.Other than a few technical issues, I have to say the game exceeded my expectations. Sure, the story can be a little all over the place, but that’s the cost of taking the franchise in a little more in-depth direction. The New Colossus firmly establishes the alternate universe that we were introduced to in The New Order and is an excellent foundation for future entries in the series.Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus wraps up the feeling of a blockbuster movie in something you can interact with. There’s a lot of games that do that, but the spectacle here is outstanding, and the fast-paced gunplay and compelling main story made me want more when the credits rolled. Killing Nazis is one of the most fun and wholesome things a person can do, and there’s no better way than to do it with Wolfenstein 2.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Forbes,"Minor spoilers follow.Wolfenstein II: The New ColossusWolfenstein II: The New Colossus picks up after the events of The New Order. The Nazi menace has subjugated not only Europe, but also the United States.The entire world is now under mecha-fascist rule and only one man can turn the tide: B.J. Blazkowicz, who comes to be called 'Terror Billy' over the course of the game.Like The New Order, The Old Colossus mixes over-the-top shooting, larger-than-life characters and crazy technology to give us a run-and-gun shooter that's plenty violent and lots of fun. It's a solid sequel, in some ways even surpassing its excellent predecessor. In other ways, however, the game falls short, lacking some of the things that wowed us about the first game and its expansion, The Old Blood.In The New Colossus, we start out with Blazkowicz confined to a wheelchair, nearing what he believes will be his death. He and Anya have a child on the way, which makes this all the more bitter. I don't want to talk too much about the specifics of the story beyond the broad strokes, however, since this is something best experienced in the game yourself. Suffice to say, there's a great cast of zany characters that you start with and meet along the way, and the game's many cut-scenes are filled with melodrama, humor, and horrific violence. Blazkowicz has some frightening backstory revealed, as well, though the scenes with his father left me feeling slightly unsatisfied, as though a piece of that story was left out.You begin the game in the wheelchair with just 50% health. Soon you'll find yourself in a special mech suit that raises your maximum armor to 200, but you'll remain at 50 health for over half the game (not counting side missions and enigma quests and the like.) For a good 5 to 6 hours you'll be at half health, and when you finally do up the maximum to 100, your maximum armor goes down to 100 as well. This was an aggravating decision on the part of MachineGames. During the first wheelchair mission, I could see this making sense, but I wish that health had returned to normal sooner.Wolfenstein II: The New ColossusThis is partly because at 50 health, any time your health goes higher than 50 it immediately begins to deplete, which in turn leads to you having to pick up a lot of health packs. So, so many health packs.B.J. will automatically pick up some items, but not if you're at the maximum. So for hours you'll be spamming the ""E"" key (on PC) to pick up health packs just to stay above 50, not to mention armor packs and ammunition galore. I've learned something about myself as a gamer in the past few years, and it's that I very much dislike having to constantly pick things up. Ammo is often bad enough, but adding in so many health packs is a recipe for tedium. Tedium is not what I'm after in a game.I've wrestled with the concept of health packs and a non-regenerating health bar versus the more modern regenerating health and shield bar we've seen in games like Halo and Call of Duty. On the one hand, I can see how health packs are more ""realistic."" You need to heal up, and that requires bandages, medicine, and so forth. On the other hand, who shrugs off burns and bullet holes this way? Realism goes out the window the moment we play any kind of game like this.Meanwhile, regenerating health has the distinct advantage of not being quite so tedious. You simply duck into cover, wait a little while, and pop back out. The justification here would be that you weren't actually shot, just rattled, and if you hadn't ducked for cover you would have gotten shot for real and killed. Both systems are abstract, obviously, so it really comes down to what's the best fit for a game and what's the most fun.I didn't mind health packs in The New Order as much because you had the 100 maximum, and because it was somewhat novel. There hadn't been a ton of shooters with health packs in recent years, so it was kind of cool to see that mechanic come back. But I'm over it now. I'd love to play this game with the option of fully recoverable health and zero health packs. I'd keep shields as pick-ups, but get rid of all the tiny ones like helmets and such. Every shield pick-up should be a vest that grants you 100 shield, especially since it depletes so quickly. Then all you've got left is ammo to pick up (and grenades and recharges, etc.) which makes this all much less tedious.Health system aside, the gunplay in The New Colossus is excellent. I've replayed some of The New Order just in case I was wearing rosy-tinted glasses, and I have to say I think they're incredibly similar but The New Colossus might be just a tiny bit smoother.Yes, guns start out a bit anemic at first, and the sound design leaves something to be desired, but by the time you have a shotgun with triple-firing shells you'll be tearing through Nazis like butter. You'll have plenty of weapons (including temporary heavy weapons) to choose from by the game's closing credits, with plenty of optional upgrades to make each weapon deadlier and more fun to use. And you don't have to carry just two at a time---gloriously, you can carry them all at once and just cycle through them with ease.Actually, the difficulty is a little uneven throughout because the game is really hard at first on the normal difficulty setting, but pretty easy one setting down. But by the time you get your health back up to 100, a full and upgraded arsenal, and the cool gadgets they introduce later into the game, you'll probably need to raise the difficulty to still feel challenged.Wolfenstein II: The New ColossusDifficulty isn't the only uneven aspect of the game.The pacing and tone are also kind of wonky. The game is incredibly serious at times, which is in keeping with The New Order, but it quickly devolves into campy, zany fun. It can be outrageously funny at times (like when one character discovers an actual working toilet and toilet-paper.) It can also be a little maudlin, which is how I described the first game at the time. Blazkowicz's inner monologue can be a bit heavy-handed and silly. And the cut-scenes can drag on, leaving someone like me, with my increasingly short attention span, bored and impatient to get back to the action. To each their own, of course, but I think the game would have benefited from fewer, briefer cut-scenes, with more story taking place off-camera during the levels.Which brings us to level design. There are some pretty cool levels in The New Colossus, but they never felt as open or interesting or well put-together as The New Order's. Stealth is less viable as well, which is a shame. And while there are open-ended levels especially in the back-end of the game, too often I felt funneled through with less player agency than before.Meanwhile, too many of these levels take place in cramped buildings, U-Boat interiors and other tight areas. I wanted more of occupied America, but you only really get a couple levels that deal with the resistance, or with Nazi-occupied US towns. This was disappointing. There was so much potential to really explore what Nazi occupied America would look like and we get far too little of that. What we do get is fantastic and fascinating, but for most of the game I felt like I was playing in oddly similar environments going through oddly repetitive motions.Still, in other ways the game has certainly improved. Melee is way more fun now, having taken a big page out of the new DOOM's playbook. And the graphics are quite a lot better, with some really gorgeous levels and great character design. I've heard some complain about poor textures, but mostly I thought the game was a nice, if not very dramatic, improvement over The New Order. More outdoor levels like the one where you run into the KKK in ""small town America"" would have been nice, as I think they'd show off the game's prettier side a bit more than all the cramped spaces.There's generally a lot more story, too, so you get more of the great writing and voice-acting that have defined this rebooted series. That makes up, to some degree at least, for the pacing issues. And the story is pretty zany, with an amazing Hitler scene and even a Nazi space base. Good stuff.All told, I really liked The New Colossus, even though I found the level design disappointing. It's entirely single-player so you won't miss out on any multiplayer action if you wait for a sale, but if you're looking for a really fun solo shooter, you could do much worse. If you liked The New Order, you'll like this, too. If you didn't...well, this probably isn't going to change your mind.I give the game a Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale, but with a caveat. The holidays are almost upon us, and I'm pretty sure we'll see at least a small discount during one of the incoming sales (either retail or on Steam or both.) The game is certainly worth full retail price, but there's so much out right now, waiting for a bargain won't hurt.Wolfenstein II: The New ColossusIt took me about ten hours to complete the main game, but there's quite a bit of side content still left for me to do, and I'll probably play through it again and make a different choice at the beginning to see how that changes the story. That's at least 20 hours of game time in a quality single-player shooter, so don't expect buyer's remorse either way.Finally, many gamers experienced some major performance issues with this game on PC. I only had one problem, however. The game froze up between the end of a mission and the following scene, forcing me to ultimately restart my machine. I only had to retrace my steps for about two minutes so it wasn't a big deal. Other than that, I've had no issues either before or after the patch. (I run an Intel i7-6700k processor with an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU.)The Good: A terrific story filled with great characters who are well written and acted. Excellent gunplay and plenty of challenge.The Bad: Tedious health packs and other pickups slow down play. The first half of the game can be frustrating. Pacing is problematic.The Ugly: It's incredibly violent and there's some very disturbing scenes, but that's what you'd expect from a game about taking down evil Nazi bastards.TL;DR: Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a great follow-up to The New Order, though it falls short in level design and stealth. It's well worth your time and money if you love single-player games, but it wouldn't kill you to wait for a sale.Platform: PC, PS4, Xbox One, later Nintendo SwitchDeveloper: MachineGamesPublisher: BethesdaRelease Date: Oct. 27, 2017Price: $59.99Score: 8/10 "
Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowWolfenstein 2: The New Colossus delivers an experience you won’t soon forget.I went into Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus high on the idea of Nazi-killing. From a combat and stealth perspective, I had a good idea of what to expect, and I looked forward to dismembering Nazis, using the game as an outlet for all the rage I avoid sharing about this topic over social media. It doesn’t disappoint; there is some damn fine Nazi killing from start to finish in Wolfenstein 2, but at the same time it’s so much more than that.There is a segment in Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus where William “B.J.” Blazkowicz transitions from a murderous, Nazi-killing rampage, to being exhausted and vulnerable in the arms of a loved one in seconds. It makes Blazkowicz feel incredibly human, and it reminds the player that behind every act of brutality is a person who has their own collection of fears, desires, and vulnerabilities. In the case of a protagonist, this is a comfortable realization for gamers. We like to see the human side of our heroes. In Wolfenstein 2, however, players will come to see that it’s not just hero’s that are human, but also the monsters they fight against.What caught me off guard was how quickly MachineGames turned Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus into a deep, emotional rollercoaster. Within 10 minutes, I cared more about Blazkowicz than any other video game character I’ve encountered this year. In fact, I can’t recall being as heavily into the journey of one since helping Geralt track down Ciri in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In Wolfenstein 2, every mission felt relevant to the ultimate goal, and I bought what MachineGames was selling right from the start.This is all done through a series of early cinematics. The events of The New Order have left Blazkowicz near death. He begins to have flashbacks to his childhood where we are introduced to his loving mother and abusive father. We can see that this man’s war has been raging his entire life and, when he believes he is about to die, he wonders if he has been good. Has he done enough to get into Heaven? I was nearly in tears after this sequence.Unfortunately for B.J., that eternal rest he seems ready for must wait. Frau Engel is back and pissed about what happened to her face. She’s looking to kill not only Blazkowicz, but everyone he cares about as well. Weak and near death, he must once again put his physical pain and emotional exhaustion aside, this time to battle the Nazi regime on US soil.The gameplay mechanics in Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus became almost secondary to me as I found myself more and more invested in the story. However, they are passable. Players can still choose to try and go in blasting with dual shotguns, or take the stealth approach and work their way through each encounter unseen. I usually started with stealth and tried to take out the Kommandant, but would screw something up eventually and then be forced to get loud. MachineGames gave me a small but enjoyable arsenal of weapons to crush my enemies with, and each one had strengths and weaknesses that helped or hindered depending on what fresh Nazi armored beast I was facing at the time.The weapon customization took a step forward in The New Colossus. In The New Order, players had to find specific upgrades in the world, and could only do so when MachineGames allowed them. In The New Colossus, you find Weapon Upgrade Kits, and can apply them to any gun, upgrading any one of three things on each one. You get to play your way through the entire journey, and I appreciated that.What worked even more flawlessly was the way perks were handled. The game has a total of 18, all of which you can work towards at the same time. There is no choosing one or the other. Each one simply comes with criteria that, if met, gives you a bonus. If you lean towards the stealth side of things, you’ll find that you’re unlocking the bonuses of stealth perks much faster than combat perks just by using a stealth play style. You’re rewarded for playing the way you want to and don’t have to spend too much time in the menus making decisions.If there is one thing that troubled me a little, it was that it seemed like Blazkowicz couldn’t take as much damage as he could in The New Order. I found myself in gun battles that featured more peek-a-boo than face to face brutality. It wasn’t terrible, but I thought B.J. felt a bit squishy for those that like to see the whites of their enemy’s eyes when they blast them straight to Hell. You can again overcharge his health, which helps, but the base health he felt a bit weak. A few times I tried to blast through several foes, I died quickly. I had to adjust my approach to one where, if I was caught sneaking about, I’d retreat and force my enemies into a kill zone where I could survive. Maybe it’s a skill issue with me, but any encounter that featured a guns blazing approach had the potential to hand me a dozen or so deaths in a short amount of time. This could be a turn off for those that dislike stealth.A possibly unpopular opinion is that there are too many collectibles in the game. I believe there are close to 300 of them in total. There are 150 readable collectibles alone. Sure, it adds to the game to read the journals of friends and foes alike, but collectibles lose their prestige when there are too many. As it is right now you’ll bump into one about every 10 feet, and it won’t be long for most players to just ignore them. The New Colossus isn’t alone here. Most games tend to do volume over quality when it comes to collectibles. I don’t feel it takes away from the overall experience of the game and wouldn’t adjust the score over it, but as someone who needs to find all the things, I was irked.What The New Colossus does get right is the length of the campaign and its inclusion of Uberkommandant missions. With the stealth approach, I took about 15 hours to work through Wolfenstein 2, but you could easily reduce that if you just used the rampage approach to every encounter. Some missions took me over an hour to complete as I scoured levels for secrets and hidden areas, but quick gamers could power through those same levels in 30 minutes or less.The Uberkommandant missions are optional side quests that you unlock just beyond the midpoint of the main story. These are accessed by killing Kommandants, taking Enigma Codes off their bodies, and then messing about with the Enigma Machine to reveal the location of an Uberkommandant. These side quests take you back to areas previously explored in the main story, but you get to access parts that were locked before. It all feels like a great hunt for high-ranking Nazi personnel, and does a fine job of giving you a bit more to do after the game is over. It also lets you fully explore those previously traveled main story areas in case you’re trying to hunt down the ridiculous number of collectibles.Further into the game players can choose from the Constrictor Harness, Ram Shackles, and Battle Walkers as a permanent Contraption. I won’t spoil why these are introduced, but each offers a different perk that allows you to approach situations in a unique manner. Unfortunately, your decision really doesn’t matter that much. My first opportunity to use one of the Contraptions was when the game needed me to get into a room that, at first glance, was seemingly inaccessible. I quickly noticed that there were three ways in, one for each Contraption. No matter what road you chose, the destination was the same. I would have liked for MachineGames to make my choice matter a bit more. Give me a reason to fire up a second attempt of the game because there are things I couldn’t discover with the Constrictor Harness, but could attempt with the Battle Walkers.While there were certainly things related to the gameplay that didn’t amaze me, most of it went unnoticed while I was playing. I was so completely blown away by the voice acting, cinematics, and writing that each mission became a means to get to more of the story when it was over.The incredible performances by the cast of voice actors had me hitting up Google for their names time and time again. Brian Bloom is masterful as Blazkowicz, and you know it in the first five minutes. Prior to Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker in The Last of Us were two of my all-time favorite performances. Personally, I believe that Brian Bloom surpassed both performances with his portrayal of Blazkowicz. It doesn’t stop there. Other notable performances in The New Colossus are Debra Wilson as Grace Walker, Gideon Emery as Fergus Reid, and Glenn Morshower as Rip Blazkowicz. I could and should go on, but it would be easier to list the characters that aren’t spectacularly played. I’m truthfully not sure if there are any.Their performances, of course, depend heavily on the writing, and The New Colossus is one of the best written games this year, if not one of the best written in recent years. Each character is unique and few, if any, are purely good or evil. Even the monsters can be compassionate or vulnerable, and the hero can be the most brutal of them all. People are complex, and the characters and dialogue are written as such. Still, MachineGames never lets you forget that, although evil people can display characteristics like those who are good, there is a clear right and wrong side in this fight.The in-game music feels like it is either taken directly from The New Order, or was built on a foundation laid by that game. It’s similar, which is fine. It still does a good job of giving you a subtle nudge when a cinematic turns from somber to almost Nazi killing time, and it lets you know when you’ve cleared an area of enemies and can relax while you scour for supplies and, obviously, collectibles.The sounds of combat are also good, but I wouldn’t put The New Colossus in elite company. There’s usually far too much going on for the player to have an opportunity to enjoy whatever small details there could be. Once things spin out of control, there are sirens, robots, dogs, frickin’ laser beams, and Nazis screaming as Blazkowicz uses his hatchet to turn their limbs into kindling. Hard to pick up on the cool sound of a magazine swap when all that chaos is going on.The cinematics are movie quality in most cases. They not only help to drive the plot forward, but they also break up the violence and help the game pace itself properly. They can range from heartbreaking to something like a pre-game pep talk, often in the same scene. It occurred to me more than once that this could be a movie, although I quickly decided Wolfenstein was ours. Gamers only. Not that I get a say.Visually, I was neither impressed or disappointed. I played the game at 2560x1440 on PC and locked my FPS at 60. It ran flawlessly with all settings cranked as high as they could go, and it was one of the lighter games I’ve ever played on my PC under those circumstances. It certainly lacks the breathtaking visuals of something like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (my gold standard for many gaming related comparisons), but I don’t feel that the game suffers visually. It’s tough to get beauty like The Witcher 3 when your setting is primarily Nazi military installations.My primary visual beef is with the lighting. I believe MachineGames used blinding light as a way for your foes to gain an advantage in some cases. Too often I would have trouble seeing entire sections of rooms because of a blinding light pointed at me. I get it, but I want to see in my games. Find another way to simulate difficulty, because any time I’m picking something up only because I see the prompt, you dropped the ball. Thankfully, this doesn’t happen often enough that it ruined anything for me.My problems with Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus are found in the gameplay, be it combat mechanics, audio, or visual. Even then, those complaints are very minor. While I think there could be improvements, I don’t feel that any of those shortcomings took away from my experience. I thoroughly enjoyed almost every minute of the game, and it wasn’t until I began to analyze things afterward and on my second pass through that I took note of some minor details.I loaded up Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus and expected to find something that was fun and outrageous with its violence. I got that, but I was shocked at just how much truth it had in it when dealing with good versus evil and hate versus love. MachineGames gives Nazis the middle finger over and over and it’s glorious the entire way, but it also deals with the complexities of some very real issues that will touch a nerve for many who play.Maybe I’m being dramatic, but Wolfenstein 2 was the game that I needed right now. It arrived and unapologetically kicked Nazis in the face at a time when certain world leaders refuse to do so. I needed a single player game to remind me that quality storytelling is still worth years of developer resources. When loot boxes are falling from the skies in World War II, and everyone needs to sell you meaningless crap through microtransactions, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus gave me an experience that was deep and entertaining. Personally, it’s probably in my top five games of all time.Bill, who is also known as Rumpo, is a lifelong gamer and Toronto Maple Leafs fan.

					Bill Lavoy posted a new article, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus Review - The Vulnerable Terror Billy 
					Very good and thorough review.				
					Thanks!				
					Also, props for not too much spoilers, I haven't played it yet and do not regret reading it				
					HI RUMPO!				
					Yo, yo, yo! You get three of those because I had to use at least five characters.				
					I agree with some other reviewers who said it's an important game, not just a very good game. In a medium and genre where most works are entertaining but intellectually vapid escapism, The New Colossus builds substantial characters and shines a light on some unpleasant social and historical realities. It deserves support from anyone who cares about such things in games.Anyway, I found that once you go ""loud"", the game really pushes you to dual wield guns. In particular, if you're discovered before you kill all the officers, you need to push hard to blast through the enemies and take them out. After that you have more ability to take it slow and pick dudes off. 				
					It was a very emotional game for me. Right from the opening cinematic, I felt like I knew how Blazkowicz felt. Even more after one particularly crazy fight in the middle, if you recall that. Not that I could relate to him based on personal experience, but the voice acting from Bloom connected with me like few characters have.				
					Yeah, it was a pretty emotional game. I took the Wyatt timeline, and his speech at the end choked me up. 				
					I took Fergus because that's who I kept in the last game and I assumed he would cuss a lot. I have to play through as Wyatt at some point soon.				
					Excellent review!!				
					Special recognition should be given to Max Hass's dialogue in this game. It is fantastically written.				
					Max Hass Max Hass Max Hass.  Max Hass!!!! Max.  Hass.  				
					Matt Damon!				
					The chess scene was fantastic. 				
					[deleted]				
					I assume it will be relevant in a future game. It's never explained. 				
Wasn't explained to me.  They did make kind of a big deal about it and then, nothing.  Maybe it comes up with the enigma missions?  I only did one of them so far. 
					Yeah, they kind of pulled a Chekov's gun without the delivery.				
					I completely forgot about that... yeah they never did anything with that as far as I'm aware.				
					I can only guess when the Vault unlocks tomorrow, which coincides with the countdown timer on that sub door, there might be some extra mission that explains a little more? 
					Good point. I forgot all about that. Now I'm curious.				
					Good article, and glad to see something posted that doesn't rush a review to market but takes its time to understand the game. On a side note, the name 'terror billy' just seemed out of place.				
					I assumed the silliness of the name was deliberate. A subtle illustration of the Nazis not really understanding American/English language and nicknames. 				
					Yeah, I think the suckiness of the nickname highlights the suckiness of Nazis.				
					[deleted]				
					Man, my pc could run this game looking and running as smooth as perfection, but I’m holding out to see the Switch version, because portable gaming is super important to this old man who’s hardly home.				"

Wolfenstein: The New Order pulled off a pretty neat trick in 2014. Spiritually, the shooting-game surprise felt like a lost gem from the late '90s era of first-person, single-player shooters, yet it had all the bombast and polish of a solid modern game. Its levels found the right balance between linear and complicated, its guns were both familiar and powerful, and its plot offered depth for those who wanted to pore through optional books and letters. At the same time, it was ham-fisted enough for anyone who just wanted to violently kill a crap-ton of Nazis.Nobody saw such quality coming from Wolfenstein, a series that had always lagged behind its more technologically advanced sibling Doom. So what happens when a game that surprised everyone gets its own sequel?The bottom-line gist of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is easy to sum up: more of the same. The game's underlying 3D engine has gotten a new coat of paint, and the world has expanded with more characters and lunacy, but this by-the-books sequel will neither disappoint fans of the original nor convert anybody unmoved by the 2014 game. And if you're showing up to this year's Wolfenstein party because, for whatever reason, you have an itch to shoot guns at virtual Nazis as of late, be ready for some issues and pacing problems on your way through a solid Nazi-stomping quest.An opening ""Previously on Wolfenstein"" video recaps the prior game's alternate-history insanity: America lost World War II while your character, an American super-soldier named BJ Blazkowicz, was in a coma. He woke to a robo-Nazi revolution, which he managed to disrupt by way of brute, gun-toting force. That didn't stop Nazi Germany from spreading its influence across the United States, however, and this time, he's on a mission to liberate his American brothers and sisters on their own soil by any means necessary.There's also the issue of BJ's body, which was all but ruined by his world-saving efforts at the end of Wolfenstein 1. Wolfenstein 2, then, opens with a dramatic ""battle-in-a-wheelchair"" sequence that forces players to contend with interesting limitations: how quickly they move and turn, what surfaces they can and cannot roll on, and limited health. This is the stuff of sequel gold: combining familiar, bombastic combat with a full-blown nuke on major series expectations. I love this level.The rest of Wolfenstein 2 plays a lot more like the first game, however, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. You wield a standard FPS arsenal of knife, pistol, machine gun, scoped rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher, and energy ""rockets""—though BJ cranks this arsenal up a bit with two perks. First, he can dual-wield any equipped weapon—because what's cooler than one German-engineered super-shotgun with a quick-rotating barrel? Two of them! And second, he can pick up the massive weapons left behind by the German Empire's robotic soldiers, ranging from focused energy lasers to fire bombs to ammo-chewing super-guns.The wheelchair goes away for the rest of the game, and you're instead always running around in some sort of robotic armor body. Eventually, your bionic body can be upgraded with a trio of options (either a bull-rush charge attack, a body-contorting super-crawl, or a pair of extendable legs), and these add a mix of combat and movement upgrades. You can only choose one at a pivotal point in the game, with the others being hidden for further upgrading later.As BJ gets his legs and tears through the world of Wolfenstein 2, the journey starts surprisingly slowly for its first five or six hours. For starters, the game's weapons start out feeling quite mealy-mouthed. Between the sound design, the animation, and the hard-to-see visual impact of how your bullet sprays land on enemies, there's just something off about the punch of the combat. It takes a while to fully upgrade your arsenal, and by the time that happens, you'll have a lot more kick to your guns, from a booming magnum to a shrapnel-spewing shotgun—and by then, more super-weapons drop from enemies as well.Part of the reason is that these and other later levels come with a delicious amount of path choice. You can opt for stealth by sneaking through levels, using silent knife throws and melee takedowns, or you can go into an area guns blazing, and it's easy to swap from one extreme to another throughout a given level. But be warned: Wolfenstein 2 has some pretty stupid AI, so you'll likely abuse the old '90s tactic of save-and-reload when a given level spams bad guys for no good reason in certain halls and paths.All of this happens, by the way, in a game whose cutscenes are among the most unnecessarily gruesome I've seen in some time. You're ordered in the game's opening to aim and shoot a big, booming shotgun at something very innocent, and soon after, you bear witness to a disturbing decapitation. Minutes later, you're out there with a gun that feels way punier than anything in those scenes.The other issue with the game's pacing is that the plot needs about 10 hours to make up its danged thematic mind. Wolfenstein 2 teeters between dark and disturbing at one moment, then schlocky and B-movie the next. BJ obsesses over what he thinks is his impending death and digs into some dark memories about his upbringing and father. These themes come up again and again and again thanks to BJ's in-combat narration. All the while, nearly every ally and combatant he meets is a nut job straight out of a '70s exploitation film, made up entirely of cliches and stereotypes. As a result, more than a few cutscenes drag on and on with bizarre rants and BJ's own illogical responses to them.Once the game finally slices off the darker end of its plot, the writers embrace a schlocky, it's-dumb-but-that's-OK action-movie pastiche. This is right around the time Wolfenstein 2 just becomes more fun to play, and that means over half of this 18-hour romp through alternate-history 1960s America is worth recommending. It's still a shame that the uneven tone gets in the way of a clear ""hero versus Nazis"" theme. The game's sadistic head villain, Frau Engel and a couple of famous-Nazi cameos make abundantly clear that Nazis suck—and these performances are easily the best in the game—but in the beat-to-beat combat, everybody you're mowing down feels either like a mindless robot or a boring bureaucrat.Gameplay footage captured/edited by Mark Walton.
In great news, everything you do in the game looks tremendous thanks to MachineGames' use of the idTech6 engine, which is an upgrade from the last game's idTech5. I tested the entire game on a souped-up PC and had the game cranking at max settings in 4K with zero hitches in framerate or responsiveness, and this was in spite of the game throwing up all manner of gorgeous particle, shadow, and lighting effects. The incredible effects of 2016's Doom engine look even better in Wolfenstein 2's open-aired, giant-city battlegrounds. I was less impressed by the sound design, however; in addition to my weapon complaints, I found that spatial audio effects were incredibly hard to read and that enemy voices, attacks, and other alerts did a bad job selling which direction players generally need to aim their guns during a frantic firefight. (I even strapped on my best headphones just to be sure I wasn't missing something, and I still struggled to notice solid sound-effect design in the game's more frantic moments.)You'd be forgiven for getting a few hours into Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus and rolling your eyes—and your mouse—all the way to an ""uninstall"" prompt. Uneven levels, confusing plots, unclear character motivations, and overlong cutscenes all work to ruin your starting efforts in the game. But if you're hungry for a solid solo shooter with a lot of combat and traversal strategies at your disposal along with epic level designs, you're probably a good candidate for being fine with the opening chunks and having your jaw truly drop by the time you reach the best bits.Verdict: Fans of the predecessor should snap this up ASAP. More casual shooter fans should tread cautiously.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox. Sign me up →
