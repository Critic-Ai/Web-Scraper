Eurogamer,"I pity the ghoul.From the moment you take control of Akito, they're everywhere. On the crosswalks and the pavements. In the hospital and the subway stations. Small, forlorn piles of clothing that once kept someone warm and dry. But now they lie in the same position they fell, sitting in untidy little clumps across the streets and buildings of Shibuya, kind of together but also kind of separate, like uneasy strangers at a dinner party. For all the sights and sounds of Ghostwire: Tokyo - and trust me, there's a lot of 'em - it's these sets of clothes that touched me most. Despite a mainline story that does its utmost best to pull at your heartstrings and connect you in some way - any way - to Akito and his psychic roommate, for all its cloying sentiment, nothing in that story made me feel as sad as the sight of all those empty outfits.It's to my considerable frustration, then, that Tango Gameworks kicks off Ghostwire: Tokyo with such a dazzling conceit but goes on to do so very little with it. Much like the neon and the puddles, the pray sites and the Jizo statues, most of what you encounter on the empty streets of Shibuya are just props. Window dressing. Though occasionally you'll find a note or a phone or some small keepsake to identify the hospital scrubs or the business suit or the school uniform beside them, most of the time you won't. Most of the time, the people of  Shibuya don't seem to matter.I suspect that's why I enjoyed Ghostwire's side missions so much. Though a touch uneven, and often recycling the same handful of core mechanics - go here, kill this, grab that, come back - it was gratifying to at least put a story if not a name to that particular pile of clothing on the street. Those missions - along with the endless but wholly gratifying pursuit to feed the city's entire population of abandoned cats and dogs - were a delight.That's not to say I didn't enjoy Ghostwire's truly dizzying blend of urban monotony and supernatural spooks, though, because I very much did, and it's a testament to developer Tango Gameworks that in spite of my disappointment with some aspects of its storytelling and core gameplay, I was suitably invested right up until the very end. I don't know how much of the story you know (and if you hope to go in without prior knowledge, as I did, I'll do my best here to hold back) but suffice to say you play as Akito, an everyday dude thrust into an entirely un-everyday life, fighting to free the city and a loved one from the tyrannical clutches of a rogue occultist. And the day the city's inhabitants disappeared was the day he found himself invaded by a spectral hitchhiker, KK, through whom Akito can imbibe otherworldly powers. I know, right? It's an utterly outlandish, outrageous story that is never concluded in any satisfactory way, and yet it's so utterly at peace with itself - so unapologetically over the top and in your face - that you find yourself wanting to play on, anyway. Sure, there are gaping plotholes and it exaggerates everything it can at every single opportunity, but these juxtapositions - the real-life drudgery and the fantastical; the car alarms and the supernatural screeches; modernity against mysticism - only add to its charm.The problem? It's the combat. It's not that it's bad per se, but it's not particularly good, either, straddling a no-man's-land of mediocrity where sometimes it feels perfunctory, and other times just frustrating. When you take on the many guises of your enemies, colloquially known as Visitors, you fight not with bullets but with magic, harnessing the elemental powers of wind, water, and fire. The latter, Wind, is your quick-fire, everyday weapon, whilst you'll pull out your restricted reserves of water and flame magic to tackle the big 'uns. And it looks spectacular, by the way. Akito's fingers fly fluidly to snap emerald tornados or red-hot fireballs at nearby foes, but that's pretty much the only thing that feels fluid about Ghostwire's combat. Your enemies flail about widely and Akito's blessed with the reaction prowess of an arthritic tortoise. I accept you might be better than me, but I suspect you'll also miss more shots than you land, too, and even utilising the game's lacklustre aim-assist doesn't do enough to ameliorate the issue. Combat does get better the more you play, but it never gets good, I'm afraid.Out and about in Shibuya this isn't too troubling, but in boss fights it can be lip-bitingly annoying, as your fingers are powered by Ether and - for reasons I don't understand, either - random items shimmer with the sheen of a supernatural oil slick that, when struck, explode into Ether shards. Consequently, street fighting rarely gets problematic as there's usually something you can smash nearby, but boss fights - again, fine, if unremarkable - definitely can be made unnecessarily scrappy difficult because of this. Sure, you can use talismans to help tip the balance in your favour, but as even the weapon-select wheel is floaty and sluggish to use, I learned not to rely on those in times of pressure, either. There are also a couple of instances where KK is forcefully severed from Akito, and these are, without doubt, the most tedious sequences of the game. The one non-magical tool in our arsenal is a bow, although, for all the good it does, you might as well bin it and just throw arrows at enemies. I found stealth kill ""purges"" and good old-fashioned running away did just as good a job the few times the game let me do so.The Visitors themselves, though? They're gloriously horrifying and horrifyingly glorious. Plucked directly from Japanese folklore, horror stories, and the nightmares of children, you'll take on a Slender Man clone with no eyes; cartwheeling, and headless, schoolgirls; a young man with martial art expertise; and a hideous woman who blows deadly kisses at you that, given Akito can't roll, I could rarely avoid. Later, you'll take on the slit-mouthed scissor woman - or Kuchisake-onna - and though her variant will pop up several times before Akito completes his adventure, I'm still absolutely terrified of her. Despite their different attack methods, though, yours rarely deviates from what you learn in the opening five minutes of the game. Shoot-shoot-shoot, wait for their ""core"" to be exposed - hearts, essentially - and then lasso them with a magical whip. If you're lucky and uninterrupted, you'll get to dispatch them there and then. If you're not, round two will ensue until one of you is dead. Them, usually.If nothing else, I've learned few things warm my heart as much as a lonely Shibuyian pooch telepathically saying ""Thanks! You're nice!"" when I share a handful of dog food.There's more, of course: a lot, more, actually. I suspect some may tire of the game's endless demands to find, and then cleanse, Torii gates - a cyclical task to clear the evil fog that clouds the streets and gates your progress - and every time I stumbled across an infrequent site of corruption - a pinky-black goo that grows in tendrils and blocks your path - I had to remind myself what it was. One of the game's most novel mechanics, hand seals, became so tedious (and occasionally unresponsive) I stopped doing them, gratefully giving in to the ""Leave it to KK"" button that Tango put there, presumably because it too figured we'd get sick of it.Most of this is aided by Spectral Vision, a blue filter that descends over Akito's sight to let him better see access points, ladders, Ether, Tengu - terrifying bird things that screech overhead but, for reasons I don't understand, kindly let us grapple off their claws - and, perhaps predictably enough, it's so useful that you'll often be obscuring Tokyo's stunning neon-soaked sights with that dreary filter. To expedite levelling up, you can wander around Shibuya hoovering up the lost souls of the city with a paper katashiro, which you can liberate courtesy of a highly-complex spirit transmission service operating from public payphones. You'll never run out of health items. You'll never run out of Meika, the city's currency. The skill tree is unremarkable. On the plus side, cats now run the city's stalls and shops - if a canine made the cut, I never met them - and oh, did I mention that your magic motorbike runs on fragrant underworld oil? But just when you're about to give up, Tango throws in some deliciously unsettling sequences that remind you why you're here. A delectable stew of modern horror tropes - think Bloober games, good old PT and yes, even The Evil Within, with warping worlds and spooky shenanigans - they're made to scare and unsettle you, and scare and unsettle is exactly what they do. Each one of these vignettes was a rare and welcomed - if all too brief - treat.If you're looking for a supernatural game that satisfactorily answers all your metaphysical queries, Ghostwire: Tokyo is not the one, I'm afraid. But while it frustrates me that Tango didn't make the most of its wonderful conceit, I can say that - dull combat aside - exploring Shibuya never bores. With one foot in the present and one very much mired in its Folklore-y past, Ghostwire: Tokyo feels simultaneously both faded and fresh. And if nothing else, I've learned few things warm my heart as much as a lonely Shibuyian pooch telepathically saying ""Thanks! You're nice!"" when I share a handful of dog food.

Link Official siteYou may not have realised it, but Ghostwire: Tokyo, developed by Tango Gameworks, is an action-adventure game. Going back and looking at the original teaser for Ghostwire may have led you to believe that the story was going to be closer to Silent Hill or Tango's The Evil Within series and, if that's the game you want, Ghostwire isn't for you. But if you want a neon Japanese adventure game where you get cool spirit powers and pet a bunch of dogs, walk right this way.The main draw of Ghostwire: Tokyo is its combat. In 2022 we've seen a lot of very precise and punishing combat-driven games. The Elden Rings and Sifus of the world love to hurt you, and make you learn the rules of play in brutal ways. Ghostwire: Tokyo just wants to give you cool magic hands which shoot lights at a mess of bad guys, then watch them melt.The combat is a lot of fun, and that's just as well because you'll do a lot of it. It's not overly complex or intricate. It's a mess of neon pulses in various hues, a few talismans which act as a sort of grenade and your spirit bow—my favourite of protagonist Akito's utilities. Eventually the game gives you enough archery buffs that you can take out most enemies with a clean headshot before they've even spotted you—whether that be from roof tops or down an adjacent alleyway.Not every encounter's so clean. Crouched behind an abandoned car I draw my bow, looking to take out some of the floating enemies above my next objective. After running out of arrows I sneak behind a ghost in a suit, quickly executing a purge and ripping out its core, drawing the attention of three other wandering ghouls who attack. I swap to my wind powers, charging bursts to hit them, but they're getting closer and I'm ducking and diving to avoid their own magic offensive. I swap to fire and charge a blistering, blazing orb which I volley into the group. My explosion damages them all just enough to expose their cores and I use my ethereal weaving to latch onto their cores, rending them clean of their undead inhabitants. Pretty flippin' cool. Tango Gameworks does an incredible job making the city feel fresh and distinct.The city of Ghostwire: Tokyo is a marvel. It's a detailed and intricate environment which, scattered with the clothes, bags, and phones of its inhabitants, feels truly abandoned. Though its details can get hazy as you sprint down the streets, Tango Gameworks does an incredible job making the city feel fresh and distinct across its various areas. Akito can squeeze down alleyways and vault any fence. And when the entire city is being patrolled by ghosts, hiding from them in nooks and crannies makes its layout feel pretty realistic.There is a lot that doesn't work about Ghostwire, sadly. The story is, eh, fine I guess. You play Akito, a man on a mission to save his little sister. Akito is in a car accident just before Tokyo is turned to spirits and KK, the ghost of a recently deceased spirit hunter, possesses Akito's weak body. They need each other because KK needs a body and Akito would be dead without KK's powers. They don't really like each other though. Their relationship is made up of grumbling complaints about being stuck with each other. Because they're men of action, of course they don't talk about their feelings or their histories. Akito's relationship with his sister Mari is told entirely through flashbacks in which he is still ashamed and avoiding his feelings. KK just doesn't trust Akito so doesn't want to chat about his family either. It's just two moody dudes hanging out. The best writing is of the bad guy Hannya, and Akito and KK's two allies Ed and Rinko. The latter especially is explored in more detail, because the protagonists because go back and forth about trusting her—exploring why KK's history with her is so complex. Akito and KK can't talk about themselves, but they're happy to talk about other people. Baddie Hannya provides the only 'oh shit' moment in the game, for my money, his cruelty and unhinged approach to life and death is genuinely unnerving, a contrast to the rest of the game's atmosphere.Ghostwire: Tokyo is creepy but that's as far as it goes. It's not horror—it's action. Though Tango Gameworks is primarily known for The Evil Within, there isn't much to fear about Ghostwire: Tokyo, although it's filled with ghosts. I am a baby when it comes to horror. I've always had to watch any horror film from between my fingers or behind a pillow. Watching or playing anything with a horror element sets my brain ablaze with possibilities in how many different nefarious ways it could rattle me to my core. And I jumped maybe twice during Ghostwire, including a time I accidentally scared myself. Weird things happen, and you may be unnerved by going into the home of a malicious spectre. If you're looking for a good scare, you're not going to get it here—even if I did say ""what the fuck is that"" maybe three or four times when seeing a new enemy or one of the few bosses the game contains. There was potential to be scary though. There is one moment where I was genuinely fearing for Akito as he was suddenly left at the bottom of an underground mine without his spirit powers. You realise as you turn to look behind you that the way you came is now littered with monsters and, for just a moment, you hold your breath as you feel suddenly alone and intimidated by the task at hand. Hannya really could win. I can't do this. But hey, give the game ten minutes and you can go get your powers back from a temple by running past a bunch of these spirits or using your handy dandy sneaking abilities. From then on losing your abilities is a normal part of some fights and kind of no biggie. That fear you felt the first time just vanishes. And that's kind of the crux of the milquetoast horror of Ghostwire: Tokyo. Lots of potential but it just doesn't follow up.What's unfortunate about the scope of the project is that one trailer for the game shows you almost everything you'll see. It's like those action movie trailers that ruin many of the set pieces before you've even got the chance to enjoy them in the cinema. The game has a few cool bosses and a couple of recurring quest situations that feel fresh, but otherwise it's very obvious about what you get.It's worth mentioning that my playthrough of Ghostwire lasted about 10 and a half hours. That's with a smattering of side missions completed as well, but mostly just sprinting through the latter half of the game in an effort to finish it. With all the side missions complete it's probably closer to 20 hours. And with collectables? Oof, goodness knows. In an age when games are always getting longer and more expansive, it was nice to be able to get through this in a couple of days.I missed a lot of side missions, but honestly, they're not hugely memorable. When you're given these quests, they're from a celestial mass of blue essence in the vague shape of a human. You can't see that they're sad or annoyed or really… anything at all. You could get some cool little stories from these adventures but they're mostly along the lines of ""I died and I have a regret"" or ""this part of the city had something wrong with it, go fight some enemies and cleanse it of bad energy"".I also experienced occasional performance issues here and there. Heavy stuttering, in particular, would happen when a fight was getting particularly messy. Additionally when I played the game on a close to brand-new laptop there were some strange latency issues between the trackpad and the game, and even heavier stuttering and asset loading issues. On my main PC, however, neither of these problems applied. Ghostwire: Tokyo is the best PlayStation 3 game I've played in years. It's like a good Japanese interpretation of the Infamous games. It's like you've got a ghost-based Watch Dogs or neon injected Bioshock. Ghostwire has the spirit of these older action games in bucketfuls and, though it's by no means perfect, it's like a glass of Coke after a long walk in the sun. Water might be better for you, but you want to indulge in something sugary and sweet despite the million health warnings. Though there are better games than Ghostwire in terms of theme, horror and graphics, this is just uncomplicated fun. Fun combat and a sophisticated city burdened with the unfulfilled potential of a far scarier experience.Imogen has been playing games for as long as she can remember but finally decided games were her passion when she got her hands on Portal 2.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Ghostwire: Tokyo will make you appreciate the little things in life. The dopamine hit derived from petting a dog wearing an adorable little bandana. How a sense of all-consuming wanderlust can accumulate as you breathe in the towering beauty of Japan's opulent capital city. That feeling of calm that washes over you as you pray to a Jizo statue for divine protection. And the joy that can be drawn from harvesting hundreds of thousands of lost souls under the warm glow of a hellish Blood Moon. Like I said, the little things. Developer Tango Gameworks has traded cinematic survival horror for spirited ghost hunting in Ghostwire: Tokyo, the developer's first new IP since The Evil Within had us recoiling against an unraveling reality in 2014. And much like The Evil Within, which was haunted by faint echoes of Resident Evil 4, this rapturous adventure has a lot of recognizable elements that are distorted by the studio's antiquated approach to scenario, combat, and world design. Release date: March 22, 2022 
Platform(s): PS5, PC 
Developer: Tango Gameworks 
Publisher: BethesdaGhostwire: Tokyo has this distinctive vibe, as if its origins are rooted in the early 00s. Like it were some undiscovered GameCube-exclusive from Capcom Production Studio 4, lining up alongside the Capcom Five in lieu of Dead Phoenix, or a Clover Studios project that flew so far under the radar that it's only now being given the chance to earn its obligatory cult-classic status. That isn't a commentary on how Ghostwire: Tokyo looks on PS5 (infrequently awe-inspiring with ray-tracing enabled), nor a reflection of how it plays (the frame-rate holds largely steady) or feels in your hands (neat DualSense tricks work to induce immersion); it's simply an acknowledgement that Ghostwire: Tokyo feels like a throwback. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. I did, after all, spend close to 30 hours trying to absorb all 240,000 lost souls spread throughout Tokyo before triggering the end-game, depositing bundles of spirits into phone booths that are hotwired into the afterlife for reasons that remain unclear. But doing so did allow me to complete the rather rudimentary skill tree that governs Akito's various abilities – or should I say KK's abilities, the spirit detective that's possessing Akito and granting him control over Ethereal Weaving. Ghostwire: Tokyo is ostensibly a first-person shooter, albeit one where your fingers shoot wind, water, and fire bullets. The combat is uncomplicated and desperately in need of depth, but there's a magic to its presentation and execution that will so easily enrapture your attention. The flashes of light as Akito's fingers contort, the fizz of energy as his wrists shift between shapes beneath hammers of the DualSense triggers – it'll draw you in and let you lean back; saving the world has never felt so undemanding. However, unlike most modern shooters, the acceleration of your turning circle is slow and full of friction – not all that dissimilar to the system employed in the Resident Evil games Ghostwire's executive producer Shinji Mikami once presided over. There's a stickiness to precise movement that makes Akito's lightning-infused bow effectively useless, and even a lock-on feature can't completely ease the frustration of throwing bursts of magical energy over and around hordes of pursuing enemies – the twisted visions that stalk Tokyo's streets, visitors from another world following a supernatural extinction event. The combo-less combat, light skill advancement, and slow movement should feel limiting, but it kind of works for what Tango Gameworks has taken aim at here. Enemy encounters always encourage forward momentum; they typically spawn center-screen and are unwilling (or otherwise unable) to push your flanks. Ghostwire: Tokyo is set in an open world, but once combat commences you'd be forgiven for thinking it were on-rails – a great light-gun game that never was, or a Killer7 without all the depravity. There's a charm to it all that's difficult to ignore. A uniqueness to the composition of its disparate elements which makes Ghostwire: Tokyo feel distinctly enjoyable, even as its repetition sets in. A pervasive sense of good-natured repetition isn't exclusive to the cycle of combat either. Ghostwire is set across an hauntingly beautiful, utterly empty vision of Tokyo. Tango Gameworks uses a narrative hook to empty the city of all but the essentials: dogs to pet, cats for business transactions, enemies to fight, collectibles to hunt, and spirits to meet. Unlike other action games of this style, Ghostwire: Tokyo is cast across a space that feels unburdened by the standards of open world exploration that were set by Grand Theft Auto 3. It's freeing in a sense, stalking the streets of such a densely structured and beautifully scaled cityscape without the burden of constant distraction – there's serenity in its silence, with long stretches of play soundtracked by little more than dogs howling at the blood moon. Areas of the city open up gradually as you cleanse Torii Gates, a cycle that you'll grow to love and loathe in equal measure. But it's worth doing, not only to push the tightly written story forward but to gain access to surprisingly thoughtful side-quests. Spirits need to be unburdened of past trauma so that they can break on through to the other side, and these short vignettes range from sharp indictments of Japan's workplace culture to off-beat toilet humor. It's playful, as is the way Ghostwire embraces shifting environments and color palettes when it pulls you through more linear levels for key story encounters.Ghostwire: Tokyo has a really strong sense of 'place'. You'll want to spend time in its world, even if there isn't all that much to do or see in it. Combat is kinetic, but lacks any real sense of progression or power. Enemies are haunting, though lacking the intelligence to really challenge. Akito and KK are good company, even as their adventures against the occult wanes over time. Ghostwire: Tokyo feels like a throwback, and there's an unmistakable pull to its action and presentation. Some of you will long for more depth and variety, but others may just fall in love with the simplicity of hunting souls, convening with spirits, and slinging magic bullets beneath the beautiful Blood Moon of Tokyo.  Ghostwire: Tokyo was reviewed on PS5, with code provided by the publisher.Josh West is the UK Managing Editor of GamesRadar+.

Metro GameCentral,"The creators of The Evil Within return with a first person open world game where Tokyo is overrun by monsters from Japanese mythology.You know something’s wrong when the video game you’re playing has a line of dialogue that admits, ‘This is tedious’. In Ghostwire: Tokyo it comes during an important, story-related side quest where you’re following around the psychic impression of a woman, as she very slowly walks across town and does a bit of shopping. The line is uttered by the voice inside the main character’s head but your own internal narrator will no doubt be saying the same thing during the entirety of this peculiarly poor first person adventure.Ghostwire: Tokyo is the third game from Japanese developer Tango Gameworks, which was founded by Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. We’re great fans of Mikami’s early earlier works, including not just Resident Evil 1 and 4 but also Dino Crisis, God Hand, and Vanquish – and that’s just the games he was director on, as he acted as producer or advisor on most of Capcom’s best titles during the mid-90s and 2000s. He’s merely executive producer on Ghostwire though and sadly this is an even more disappointing game than the two The Evil Within titles.The Evil Within was a clear attempt to leverage Mikami’s fame and experience with a Resident Evil 4 style experience that, while it has its fans, we found muddled and derivative – with the sequel being even more disappointing. Despite what you might imagine though Ghostwire is not a horror game. It’s all about ghosts and yōkai and other elements of Japanese mythology but, as the 12 age rating implies, it doesn’t even try to be tense, let alone scary.The set-up is not well explained but it involves an unnamed man in a hannya mask disincorporating the entire population of Tokyo, evaporating their bodies and leaving their spirits to be collected by his minions… and to give you side quests. There’s a specific reason why he does this, but it’s blandly predictable and has nothing like the emotional edge the game is obviously going for.You play as a young man named Akito, who is killed in the opening scene but becomes possessed by a ghost hunter named KK and granted his ill-defined powers. He then learns that his sister is somehow key to the villain’s plans and *sigh* sets out to rescue her.KK is the voice that complains about boring side missions but why Akito’s mind is still in his body is not explained. In fact, almost nothing is explained, especially the scientific angle (obviously inspired by Shin Tensei Megami) that sees maths equations appearing during exorcisms and spirits being transmitted by phone wire, in order to be reconstituted as living people at the other end.Ghostwire is silly without being fun, and that’s always a bad combination. Although the most fundamental problem with the game is that its action is not only dull but it’s extremely repetitive, has almost no nuance, and barely evolves at all throughout the whole game. You have three different magical attacks, each of which has their own ammo, with the initial Wind power working something like a revolver.The water attack is more like a shotgun, and used to attack across a wide arc, while the fire attack is essentially a rocket. You can unlock, via the least exciting skill tree we’ve seen in a long time, what are essentially alt modes for each but that’s it – the weapons you’ll be using for 95% of the time (including a bow and arrow you almost never need) are given to you in the opening hours and nothing else is ever introduced beyond a slow-to-power-up smart bomb style attack.Although it’s rarely necessary, you can block and sneak up to stealth kill enemies but the vast majority of encounters are just standing around in the street shooting at monsters with almost no artificial intelligence and none of which require any unique strategies beyond slowly backing away from them. There’s no cover system or dodge, but because the movement controls have a weird, intentional lag to them, the combat relies heavily on an auto-aim option on the left shoulder, without which it is almost impossible to hit enemies with any precision.Why anyone involved thought this would be a solid enough foundation for an entire game we have no idea but it’s almost the only gameplay mechanic in the game. You can grapple to the top of buildings and glide for a short distance, but the only challenging thing about the platforming is that mantling is frustratingly inconsistent. There are no puzzles and the open world exploration is based on a small number of repeating scenarios that are copy and pasted across the city in bog standard Ubisoft style.The side missions are definitely the most interesting parts, as they usually revolve around traditional yōkai, rather than the mostly invented ones you fight against. These monsters are not necessarily antagonistic and some have to be protected from a wave of attackers or simply placated with some food. There are tanuki to find disguised as everyday objects, weasel-like kamaitachi to chase, and various one-off hauntings and possessions.Apart from providing an interesting primer on Japanese mythology none of this involves any complex gameplay and many have you simply wandering about a house looking for interactive objects. One, which seems dull almost to the point of parody, involves poking around a closed down office looking for emails describing why people kept quitting their job there – because their boss, who is now a spirit, can’t move on without knowing.Given how many icons are plastered across the game’s map the sheer lack of interesting things to do in the game is almost impressive, as if someone made the game world but intended to put the gameplay in later – but forgot until the last minute.To add insult to injury, the way Tokyo is portrayed is extremely unflattering, since there are no people around to talk to and everything is set at night and often in the rain. Tokyo is one of the most exciting cities in the world to visit and games like Yakuza show this very well. Ghostwire’s version of the city is, literally, devoid of life and while it certainly looks authentic it’s just an empty husk, reduced to miles of boring grey concrete and seemingly endless construction yards.The one positive about the game is that there are some visual flourishes that hint at the talent that obviously resides at Tango Gameworks, but which has so far been sadly misdirected. Occasionally the game will use the reality bending abilities of its antagonist to flip the world literally upside down, while wall murals can come alive, and you’ll randomly see road markings fluttering in the wind as if they’re paper decorations.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationAll of this is very rare though, and absolutely not worth enduring everything else to see, in what is a depressingly dull experience whose final failure is some truly pathetic boss battles, that make you wonder whether the developers were working on the game under some kind of duress.We can’t say this is the worst game of the year – that title is unlikely to be stolen away from Babylon’s Fall – but it is certainly the most disappointing. It triggers the same reward centres in the brain as the average Ubisoft open world game but it’s so lacking in serious challenge it barely feels interactive. Why anyone involved ever thought Ghostwire: Tokyo was a good idea is a far more pressing mystery than anything that actually happens in the game.In Short: Rarely has such a big budget game been based on such a thin gameplay premise, with this bafflingly dull first person action adventure that begins to run out of steam by the end of the tutorial level.Pros: At times the game can be very visually inventive, even if those moments are few and far between. Learning about yōkai is interesting and everything works with a degree of competence.Cons: Dull combat never evolves beyond the initial hours. No other major gameplay mechanics of any note and little in the way of engaging storytelling. Uninteresting open world and terrible boss battles.Score: 4/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed) and PCPrice: £59.99Publisher: BethesdaDeveloper: Tango GameworksRelease Date: 25th March 2022Age Rating: 12Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Game Informer,"Ghostwire: Tokyo has a completely dead world, empty of any other human beings or people to talk to. It also has rote and repetitive combat with a bland and uninspired story. And yet, I love it more than I like most games, even if I think a lot of people won't. It might take a bit to explain why, but it all starts with Ghostwire's best feature: its cold, lifeless map. Early in the game, a supernatural force causes everyone roaming around the Shibuya Ward of Tokyo, Japan, to vanish. A mysterious man flashes on the many LED screens around Shibuya Scramble – the famously busy real-world intersection where the game also begins – spouting some nonsense about saving people's souls and so on. The long and short of it is: that guy has stolen the souls of everyone around you, except yours. You assume the role of Akito, who is spared from death when possessed by a spirit named KK. For reasons never abundantly clear, KK being in your body also means you have elemental powers. And wouldn't you know it? Spooky ghosts and monsters are now roaming Tokyo's streets without a care in the world. KK needs Akito's body to save the world from this maniac terrorizing Tokyo. Akito just wants to save his sister. If you can put your differences aside, you might just be able to do both. It's a bland story that never does anything unexpected and never reaches beyond just okay. I did enjoy Akito and KK's banter, but beyond that, I never found myself all that invested in their arcs. There are a small number of side characters throughout Ghostwire – both friend and foe – but none get much screentime or development beyond whatever gameplay purpose they're serving in the given moment, be that a boss fight, new objective, mechanic, so on, and so forth. What the story does, however, is give narrative justification for why Shibuya is empty (save for those spooky ghosts). And I think this is one of the more interesting parts of Ghostwire; its open-world take on Shibuya is a fantastic recreation of architectural density – minus the people. Not only are buildings tightly packed together, but they feel massive in the way real skyscrapers do. Thanks in no small part to Ghostwire being in first-person, this is immediately apparent. I loved craning my neck up at the buildings around me, feeling the game's sense of space and scale. That scale extends far outward, too, as it captures Tokyo's urban sprawl; crossing the map takes time, though I rarely felt bored walking around like a virtual tourist. Ghostwire is obsessed with the idea of urban isolation, that even in a city where millions of people live on top of each other, you can feel alone. Ghostwire achieves this feeling by completely taking people away. There's an eerie quality to walking around a city without its population, knowing there's no one to talk to beyond yourself and the (literal, in this case) voice in your head. More often than not, I found myself wishing there were people – or even just one friendly person – I could find on Ghostwire's streets. Not because I was ever bored walking through an empty world, but rather its sense of isolation and loneliness was incredibly effective and haunting. And I genuinely mean haunting. Ghostwire takes every chance it has to sell its spiritual apocalypse. Occasionally, the game will mess with you. Walking around, I'd see the painted lines on the street waving in the wind as if they were thin pieces of paper. Or I'd turn a corner and realize that, in just maybe one alley or one small city block, the rainfall was now blood, soaking the surrounding buildings and street in a dark, sludgy red. More dramatically, at key story elements, the world breaks around you. In fantastic set-piece moments, levels twist, warp, and change seamlessly before your eyes, as if M.C. Escher has taken over as art director. It's endlessly impressive and fun to look at, and I loved using photo mode to capture the bizarreness surrounding me. Recalling classic rapture imagery, personal belongings litter the map exactly where they were left – you can't take your purse or cellphone with you to the afterlife. Most strikingly, clothes are everywhere. Especially in high-population areas, there are often vast seas of garments littering the floor where people vanished. It's imagery like this that hammers home not just the scale of the game's rapture but how terrifying something like this would be. Add that the city is still functioning – lights are on, speaker systems play, you can go into the subway or inside convenient stores – and Ghostwire has a world not hampered by its lack of things to do but strengthened by its commitment to being desolate. Desolate except for those spooky creatures, of course. Ghostwire's antagonist is fusing the worlds of the living and the dead. This sets the stage for most of its gameplay and combat. Bringing together this world with the next leaves Shibuya overrun with spirits. The vast majority of Ghostwire is running from point A to point B, fighting a variety of hostile yōkai littering the streets on the way, getting to your destination, and then fighting some more. There's a solid weight and crunch to combat that's satisfying from an audio and visual perspective. All Akito's elemental powers have their unique advantages, too. I enjoyed swapping between my fire attack, which casts a high-damage explosion, and my water attack, which sends out a wide arc that hits multiple enemies at once. Other fun powers, like a wind attack with a high rate of fire, magical bow-and-arrows, and talismans that freeze enemies, among others, are all fun to experiment with. And using the ethereal weave – which is basically a magic string – to rip out enemy cores always looked great. Even though it doesn't have guns, Ghostwire effectively plays like a first-person shooter. But not a very good one. Aiming is often clunky and imprecise, and I found myself missing more attacks than not. Encounter design also rarely changes from: there's a handful of enemies surrounding this point of interest, kill them, move on. It's not necessarily bad insofar as it gets the job done, but combat quickly becomes repetitive. The game's handful of bosses don't fare any better, which often feel awkward and sluggish to fight. Not every spirit is out to kill you, though. When you're not blasting your way through Shibuya, you're rounding up spirits trapped between the two worlds. There are over 240,000 lost souls you need to help usher back into the mortal coil, which means spending a ton of time walking around collecting – which boils down to holding a button, or very rarely, solving a small puzzle – and depositing at various payphones throughout the map. Luckily, you pick up spirits in mass, so you don't have to individually collect all 240,000, but it's still a tedious side-objective. But I don't find myself coming down too hard on the game's core loops. On the one hand, it is a repetitive, fairly bland take on the tired Far Cry formula. On the other, on top of loving Ghostwire's world, its yōkai designs stand in a league of their own – it has some of my favorite enemy designs in years. Mixing traditional Japanese folklore with its contemporary setting, looking at the terrifying enemies never got old. My favorites include the Lamentation and Shiromuku, whose long black hair is reminiscent of classic Japanese horror film characters Sadako (Ring) and Asami Yamazaki (Audition), as well as the various takes on Kuchisake-onna, the slit-mouthed woman, who borrows heavily from her design in 2007's Carved. For a horror fan, especially one who grew up watching Japanese horror movies, I couldn't help but nerd out on all the various creature designs, no matter how many times I fought them. It also helps that Ghostwire is really short. I completed the campaign in about 14 hours, though I've spent a few extra afterward cleaning up side stuff. Bland as a lot of its gameplay and story may be, Ghostwire never wastes your time. It gets in and out long before anything gets too old, letting you enjoy everything you like about the game without wearing you down with things it does poorly.Which makes Ghostwire a strange game to review – at least within the often-restrictive confines of a scoring system. The things I like about Ghostwire, I really like. I'd go so far as to say that some elements – its world, enemy design, etc. – are among my favorites in a game in years. That said, there are plenty of elements, such as story and gameplay, where GhostWire is hardly up to snuff. I fully expect some people won't be smitten with the game the way I am, and I think it's completely understandable if you don't want to forgive the game for that. But if Ghostwire connects with you, I think it'll really connect with you. It's weird and unique, and I think it's great to see this kind of game get this kind of budget, put it all on the table, and use that money to do some baffling and great art. And for that alone, I can't help but love Ghostwire.

GameSpot,"Ghostwire: Tokyo's unique supernatural combat and eerily beautiful open-world paper over the cracks of its subpar story and inconsistent side missions.By 
    Richard Wakeling
   on March 21, 2022 at 10:41AM PDTTango Gameworks' The Evil Within and its sequel are quintessential Shinji Mikami games, brazenly following in the footsteps of Resident Evil 4 by mixing survival horror and action with an over-the-shoulder perspective. The studio was never meant to be an avenue for Mikami's own creative vision, though. Tango was established with the aim of showcasing new and talented young creators, and Ghostwire: Tokyo is the first game to really demonstrate this aspiration. There's nothing else that can compare to its peculiar brand of open-world exploration and supernatural combat, as it borrows familiar elements and combines them with new ideas in imaginative and surprising ways. It may stumble at times, but the sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine through.Ghostwire: Tokyo's story begins at a rapid pace with one of its protagonists lying dead on the floor. After being involved in a fatal car accident on Tokyo's famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, Akito Izuki is brought back from the dead when a shadowy spirit calling himself KK merges with his body. The unholy union between the pair gives Akito access to KK's supernatural powers, but before he's even able to fathom what the hell's going on, the rest of Tokyo's residents are engulfed by a malevolent fog that blankets the entire city. A menagerie of evil spirits known as Visitors now roam Shibuya's streets in their stead, so it's up to Akito and KK to put a stop to the masked villain responsible before the situation worsens.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Ghostwire: Tokyo ReviewBoth protagonists have different motivations for embarking on this dangerous quest, beyond their responsibility to save the world. KK is seeking revenge while Akito is desperate to save his younger sister after she's kidnapped by the villain for nefarious purposes. The connection between Akito and KK is the strongest aspect of Ghostwire: Tokyo's narrative, as their budding relationship takes center stage and develops naturally over the course of the game. The incidental banter between the pair adds levity to what is oftentimes bleak subject matter, and it's easy to become invested in their predicament even when the mysteries surrounding KK's past are ultimately unfulfilling.The rest of the cast isn't given enough screentime to really stand out or cultivate any kind of attachment, so attempts to land an emotional payoff are stunted. Akito's sister, Mari, is a prime example of this as she's more of a plot device than an actual character. The villain is severely underutilized, too. His motives make him potentially sympathetic, but instead he's one-note and completely forgettable as a result.The story's shortcomings are disappointing considering the early potential of its alluring mysteries, but even this isn't enough to detract from Ghostwire: Tokyo's fantastic combat, setting, and world-building. When KK entwined with his body, Akito gained access to supernatural powers known as Ethereal Weaving, granting him the ability to unleash projectiles from his fingertips. Ghostwire: Tokyo forgoes physical firearms--instead, Akito is constantly contorting his hands and performing the finger gymnastics required to conjure spectral powers. You start the game with access to Wind Weaving, allowing you to pelt Tokyo's invading spirits with neon gusts of wind, but by the end of the second chapter, you'll also add both Fire and Water Weaving to your repertoire. The former unleashes a destructive missile that deals heavy damage, while the latter's horizontal burst and wide spread make it an obvious shotgun analog. Each flick of the finger discharges these soaring projectiles that collide with a palpable ferocity, sending vibrant particles scattering into the night sky.[Ghostwire: Tokyo's] sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine throughCombat takes a while to find its stride and feels stilted for the game's first couple of hours, mainly because the fire rate of Wind Weaving is painstakingly slow. Once you start delving into Akito's skill tree, however, this gradually begins to change. Increasing the rate of fire does wonders to the sense of impact and satisfaction that comes from rapidly blasting enemies away, and the combat's dynamism only continues to grow once you unlock more powers. You'll start utilizing Water Weaving in close-quarters to pulverize multiple enemies at once, propel Fire Weaving's flaming area-of-effect attack to damage some of the game's toughest foes, and throw magic Talismans to lock Visitors in place.A significant reason why combat feels so gratifying is because of the way enemies react to your attacks. You might be fighting apparitions that have some basis in Japanese folklore, but you're constantly ripping off these digital chunks to reach the inner core festering below the surface. All of the enemy designs feel like a reflection of Tokyo and its people, meshing modernity with the past. Just as towering skyscrapers cast shadows over traditional Shinto shrines, so too do these evil spirits emerge from contemporary issues. The faceless, umbrella-wielding Visitors are born from the hearts of those pushed to exhaustion by their work, while the headless spirits scurrying around the city in school uniform are derived from the anxieties of students.Ghostwire: Tokyo isn't a particularly scary game, despite these descriptions, yet the atmosphere it conjures is unmistakably eerie. An empty city is always going to be inherently unnerving, but that's especially true of one as populated and dense as Tokyo. This isn't your typical post-apocalyptic metropolis either, as Shibuya's denizens have only recently vanished. There are still signs of life everywhere you look, with music emanating from the innards of karaoke bars; LED billboards illuminating the rain-soaked urban sprawl; convenience stores welcoming your patronage with a merry jingle and shelves stacked with freshly wrapped onigiri; and discarded clothes, shoes, umbrellas, and phones strewn across the floor, left behind by those consumed in the fog.One glance at the map is enough to incur the dread of open-world fatigue, yet the majority of the myriad icons simply represent shops you can visit to purchase healing items. Exploration never feels overwhelming, mainly because you gain access to sections of the city in bite-sized chunks. By cleansing corrupted Torii gates throughout Shibuya, you'll gradually disperse the harmful fog and reveal new side missions and collectibles. These optional quests are concise vignettes that usually revolve around helping spirits that are trapped in a state of limbo. This might include recovering cursed objects that were sold by a secondhand shop, searching an otherwise quiet neighborhood for the source of ominous piano music, or investigating a construction site where a rash of mysterious deaths has occurred.You can typically complete these side missions in a few minutes, and their quality fluctuates wildly from one to the next. At their best, you'll unravel a compelling paranormal mystery that mixes combat and exploration; at their worst, you'll be thrown into a bland arena battle or have to tail a yokai for what feels like an eternity. These side missions are never outright bad, and they typically shed light on a particular facet of Japanese folklore, but too many of them lack depth and feel like they were included just to pad out the open-world activities.Finding out that a Nurikabe is essentially a big mattress that enjoys impeding pathways, or that a Kappa can't resist a good cucumber, is a part of what makes exploring Ghostwire: Tokyo's open-world such a joy. It has an irreverent charm that pops up from time to time. You can pet, feed, and read the thoughts of dogs, for example, and spiritual cats now run all of the city's convenience stores because they need to earn enough money to purchase nether catnip. You'll also use what's known as a Katashiro to consume friendly spirits and then feed them into a magic payphone to save them in exchange for money and XP. And it all makes complete sense because Tango Gameworks has established such a tangible sense of place.Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to open-world games, but its unique setting, tremendous attention to detail, and singular combat make it stand out amongst its contemporaries. The story stumbles and not all of the side missions are particularly engaging, yet these aspects are easy to push to the back of your mind when you're using finger guns to tear through corrupted spirits with dazzling aplomb. Shinji Mikami is a legendary director, but taking a backseat and letting new voices come to the fore has paid off.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Despite the care on display, Tango’s newest is too often a slogGhostwire: Tokyo is a game that isn’t afraid to ask the big questions: What happens after we die? Is the body really just a corporeal prison for our true essence? Can you find a second roll of toilet paper for this ghost so they can ascend to heaven and the next ghost can use the bathroom (and then also pass to the realms beyond)?This is a singular game, no doubt, but its most intriguing elements are often drowned out by uneven execution.Akito is a regular young man, hovering between life and death after a motorcycle accident, until his body is unceremoniously hijacked by a spirit named KK. Since Akito isn’t quite done with his body, the two are forced into an uneasy alliance — bodymates, if you will.KK’s arrival is well timed, as Tokyo has just been blanketed by a mysterious fog that separates human souls from their bodies, leaving their ghostly apparitions to float between skyscrapers and through rooftop gardens.Though his spectral partner is focused on the disastrous fog, Akito has his own motives: His sister Mari is lying defenseless and unconscious in a hospital. He has to get to her, and cooperating with KK is the only way to make it happen, thanks to the malicious demons now prowling the streets.In exchange for taking up meat space, KK provides Akito with the ability to cast elemental magic from his fingertips. The powers equate, vaguely, to classic first-person shooter archetypes: Wind can be fired quickly from your fingertips, water has a broader, shotgunlike arc, and the fire spell is an explosive blast with a wide area of effect. Though Ghostwire: Tokyo may be metaphorically in line with a typical first-person shooter, it doesn’t feel much like one. Controls feel sluggish and swimmy to an extent that I swapped controllers because I thought something must have been malfunctioning. Jacking camera acceleration and deceleration to the max helps, but it’s no silver bullet.There’s also a much shallower pool of offensive abilities than you might expect in a modern shooter. How shallow? Well, you already know all the powers: those three I listed above. That’s it. You can charge each of those three for a stronger version, and you get a bow that’s useful for the rare (yet annoying) sequences where you’re separated from KK’s power. You can also rip out an enemy’s core when it’s near the brink of death. But after you’ve gotten all these skills in the opening couple hours of the game, you’ve pretty much seen it all.With few new tricks on offer after the opening segment, Akito’s hunt for Mira soon feels like a slog. The enemies provide a little variety, but the techniques you’ll use to defeat them aren’t all that different. Block their attacks, then shoot them. Even this core combat loop feels off somehow. Charged attacks don’t use additional ammo, so you’ll always want to charge, if possible. But you very, very often need to interrupt your charge to block an attack. A block, even a perfectly timed one, doesn’t flow naturally into a counterattack. This turns every enemy attack into an interruption rather than a real threat or opportunity, and prevents battles from settling into a satisfying flow.The systems built around the core combat feel similarly disjointed. Talismans that can help turn a fight in your favor are consumable, but so expensive that I wasn’t inclined to use them. Healing items are so plentiful that I never ran out. (I never even came close.) And one incredibly useful, borderline game-breaking power that lets you create your own grapple points is just kind of randomly dropped into the upgrade tree.Despite all of these substantive flaws, though, I can’t deny that I often found myself charmed by Ghostwire: Tokyo — most frequently when I left the critical path to help some wayward ghosts wrap up their unfinished business.These side quests aren’t that compelling from a mechanical perspective, but many are intriguing little vignettes. The aforementioned toilet mission is the most far-fetched one I encountered; however, there are plenty of others that vacillate between sad and silly, poignant and banal.These personal stories function well in part because many of them — as well as much of the rest of the game — are deeply rooted in Japanese culture and folklore. For example: You increase your spell ammo by uncovering “Jizo statues.” I wasn’t initially familiar with the term, which led me to the lovely and sad history behind these figures. They purportedly provide protection to travelers and help shepherd the spirits of deceased children.The enemies, too, are all archetypes of Japanese society that were, for one reason or another, driven to demonhood through dissatisfaction with their earthly existence. Here’s the description of the headless young guys in school uniforms called “Students of Pain”:“A type of Visitor born from the restlessness of young male students faced with hazy futures. They unleash the full brunt of their frustration upon anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with them.”(This describes most of the interactions I’ve had with regular, living high school boys, but that’s neither here nor there.)Heck, the default is subtitled Japanese dialogue, though English voice-over is available, if that’s your thing. I left Japanese voices on for the entirety, though, because they helped draw me even deeper into the world. The immersion is aided by the fact that the world of Ghostwire: Tokyo is beautifully rendered and lit, with an attention to detail that makes the streets and homes feel lived in despite, you know, everybody being dead.Ghostwire: Tokyo won’t convert you into an expert in Japanese culture, obviously, but feeling like I had received tiny chunks of insight into that world and Shinto religion as I played really elevated side quests above the typical “help, my basement is full of rats” fare.If there’s a central theme that connects these various threads, it’s one of living life for the present, and the folly of holding onto anger and guilt. Though occasionally affecting, the impact is undermined by a central story that never quite finds traction.Firstly, there isn’t enough oxygen given to the relationship between Akito and Mari, so there’s very little narrative fuel propelling you through the story. There is an overstuffed sequence in the game’s final chapter that makes a go of developing this relationship, but it’s ... too much, too late. Whenever Mari was mentioned, I was embarrassed to have utterly forgotten that my beloved sister was imprisoned somewhere between the worlds of the living and the dead. I won’t spoil KK’s core motivations here, but suffice it to say: They are equally lacking in narrative propulsion.Perhaps the kindest thing I can say about Ghostwire: Tokyo is that it’s an endearing experience. There’s a lot of care on display, from the cultural detail in the sweet side stories to the rendering of the rain-swept world itself. But whatever charm there is gets bogged down by frustrating design decisions and sluggish mechanics. It may be a captivating setting, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is difficult to recommend to all but the most devoted students of Japanese culture.

Ghostwire: Tokyo is Tango Gameworks‘ third title, and the first it’s produced outside of The Evil Within series. It’s memeorable introduction to the world by Ikumi Nakamura gave players high hopes that it be a quirky outlier in the world of AAA productions. Nearly two years later, we’ve finally got a chance to play it and see if it lived up to expectations.In Ghostwire: Tokyo, you play as the last living soul in Shibuya. You play as Akito, who is near death due to a traffic incident. However, he’s saved as his body is inhabited by KK, a spirit running from a mysterious force that soon covers the area with a mysterious fog. As the fog sets in, 200,000 people disappear, leaving only their clothes and belongings behind. Unfortunately, just as quickly as they vanish, malevolent spirits called Visitors arrive to take their place. Fortunately, Akito’s meld with KK gives him the powers he needs to fight these foes.Your first destination in the game is to check on Akito’s sister, who ends up having something to do with the events that are transpiring, and we’re introduced to the villains of the game. A group of people with Hannya masks that are incredibly powerful. They’re also the same group KK was running from when the game began.The objective here is to unravel the mystery of the fog and to rescue Akito’s sister. You’ll also have to dive into KK’s past as a cop and find out his role in this whole thing.This journey will take players across a large, lovingly-crafted chunk of Shibuya. As I stated in our preview, exploration is limited by the fog. If you enter the fog, you’ll immediately take damage and have to turn back. Fortunately, cleansing torii will push the haze back and allow you access to new areas.While Shibuya is technically an open world, the fog funnels you into specific areas, making the game relatively linear. You can backtrack and complete side missions or pick up collectibles you’ve missed. Still, the way forward in the story is always fairly narrow. I liked the focus, but those expecting a traditional open world will likely be disappointed at how frequently the game bars your path. There’s no seeing something and going to it. Instead, you’ll have to hope the story curves you toward that area at some point.There’s nothing terribly innovative about Ghostwire: Tokyo, though I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation. Its urban setting lends itself well to vertical exploration, and one of Akito’s powers lets him grapple a flying tengu to boost to new heights. However, though it’s beautiful to behold, this Tokyo lacks substance. There’s no emergent gameplay to be found here, and exploration leads to the same things to collect or variations on the same side quests. This environment is primed for random and memorable events to occur, but it feels dead, even for a city filled with spirits.Despite technically being a first-person shooter, combat is Ghostwire: Tokyo is more anime than Call of Duty. Instead of firearms and grenades, you’ll be using spiritual energy and paper talismans. There’s also a fairly strong bow, but ammo for it must be found or purchased. Unfortunately, this aspect of the game became tiring over time. Enemies are bullet sponges, and I never found Akito’s powers particularly exciting.He has a Wind attack that is weak but can be fired rapidly, a water attack that fires in an arc but is very short-ranged, and a powerful fire attack that can be charged up and tossed to create an explosion. The talismans, which are used as secondary weapons, can be planted to create a field that stuns enemies or used to create concealment for Akito to sneak past foes. Stealth attacks are also available (and encouraged), and can quickly defeat most lower-tier enemies.The crux of Ghostwire: Tokyo’s combat is exposing the Vistors’ cores and ripping them out with ghostwire. Doing this defeats them and nets you some ammo and HP, but it also leaves you momentarily vulnerable. Fortunately, you can rip out multiple cores at once, so the idea is to make multiple ghosts vulnerable at once and then execute them simultaneously. However, it rarely works out that smoothly unless you can get enemies to group up.The biggest issue here is that enemies have too much HP and most of Akito’s attacks feel like they have no oomph. The Wind elemental especially just feels like you’re throwing empty cans at ghosts. Of course, there’s a big ol’ skill three that you can use to upgrade attacks, but these are so incremental that they never feel like a significant boost.Players also get a spiritual shield they can defend with so enemy attacks cause either partial damage or no damage if it’s raised in a perfect block. However, I rarely found myself using the shield except for when I was facing bosses. It was just easier to move away from enemies than to attempt to block them.The main factor that makes the combat interesting is that it fits the story and aesthetic. You’re fighting spirits from Japanese folklore, and it makes sense that you’d do it with a sort of magical Jutsu. Also, despite my disappointment with the execution, combat is paced out enough to where it doesn’t get annoying.I also found that the game overuses stealth mechanics. As stated above, players can close in on unaware enemies and hit them with a sneak attack that usually ends with a kill. However, it’s something we’ve seen in a hundred other games, and Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn’t do anything to innovate on the concept.This game suffers from an issue many titles with stealth do, and that’s the fact that if one enemy in an area sees you, then all of them do. You can use the bow and arrow to stealth kill an enemy from afar, but it frequently takes at least two hits to do so. As soon as they get hit, it breaks their stealth, and you’re back to fighting like normal.Fortunately, most of the game is stealth optional, but some segments force it. These were my least favorite parts of Ghostwire by far, and I couldn’t wait until they were over.I played the game on a PS5, and I highly recommend everyone uses one of the performance modes. The quality settings are pretty but drop the framerate enough to detract from the experience. I also detected a bit of input lag when playing on quality that was bad enough to make me feel a bit motion sick. I’ve experienced the same thing when playing Bloodborne, and I assume that, like with that game, Ghostwire: Tokyo has some framepacing issues on certain graphics modes.Fortunately, even on performance settings, the game is good-looking and brings Tokyo to life with high-res textures and excellent lighting effects. It was a relatively bug-free experience as well, and I never ran into anything game-breaking.Ghostwire: Tokyo’s biggest problem is that it takes very few chances. Unfortunately, the gameplay is just too familiar for its own good. It’s got a great premise, and I loved its version of Tokyo. However, the story and setting are in a framework that’s all too familiar. It also has a hard time figuring out whether it wants to be a linear or open world title.Despite these issues, it has a compelling story, and I enjoyed the journey from start to finish. It’s great seeing an accessible AAA title like this utilize Japanese folklore as its inspiration and shows just how far we’ve come from the 90s where JRPGs were downplaying those sorts of things.We played Ghostwire: Tokyo for around 40 hours on normal difficulty and completed the main story and a significant portion of the side quests via code provided by PR.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkFor a long while I wasn’t sure what to think of Ghostwire: Tokyo. The marketing made it look like it lacked personality, and it wasn’t until I actually got to play it for myself that I started to see its potential and what it was going for.Having finished it I’m still a bit torn, but I think a lot of people are going to dig it: especially if you can get past some of the traditional open world design and peel back the layers within.Ghostwire: Tokyo (PC, PS5) [timed exclusive for one year] Developer: Tango Gameworks Publisher: Bethesda Released: March 25, 2022 MSRP: $59.99Leading up to Ghostwire, most of the marketing was bent on the “mystery” angle, but a lot of that gets dispelled quickly: in a good way.Our hero Akito (possessed in part by a spirit named KK) shows a lot of emotion right out of the gate, and has a purpose beyond the general “what is going on” macro-narrative. While the simple fact that nearly everyone in Tokyo is missing due to some apparent supernatural cataclysmic event is kind of important, we do get to go on a personal journey as well. The adversarial relationship between Akito and KK reminds me of War and The Watcher from Darksiders, and gets really catty at times. It’s great.Developer Tango Gameworks recommends playing Ghostwire with Japanese audio, and I have to agree. While the English dub is fine (and available day one baked into the game), the Japanese voice cast is clearly the focal point, and it helps augment the unique feel of Ghostwire. Just like the Yakuza series, it’s refreshing to see a game about Japan made by a Japanese game studio. While there are Tengus to grapple on and fling yourself into the air (and other fantastical elements), Ghostwire‘s architecture and foundation is grounded.It is limited, though. There are many places you simply can’t go (and little in the way of Yakuza‘s eccentric minigame dalliances), and a lot of the fun with the traversal system involves hopping around rooftops with a light glide mechanic. Ghostwire has a lot of open world staples to boot, which can be a boon or a burden depending on how you look at it. “Cleansing gates” (to unlock more of the world and create more point of interest icons on your map) is a clever way to deal with radio towers, as there’s (with few exceptions) no climbing required. There are a lot of pins to sift through, but not a cynical amount, and side quests mostly offer a unique angle or thread rather than a series of dull repeated concepts.The whole “everyone is gone” angle is a genius way to avoid having to render myriad open world bystander models, and creates an eerie effect that’s seldom seen in a lot of other open world games. But like several other elements of Ghostwire, it’s give and take. While there are NPCs (mostly in the form of spirits and cat vendors), they’re few and far between, and enemies are the main bodies you’re going to be running into most often. Which leads me to some of the more polarizing elements of Ghostwire: enemy variety. It starts off in a low spot and never really escalates from there with much urgency.Early game enemies mostly all look the same, with two core variants: salarymen Slender Man stand-ins with umbrellas, and headless school girl creatures. As you progress you’ll get to see more and more variants (little raincoat-wearing patrols that summon more foes, giant scissor demons straight out of a classic Capcom horror game), but the core boots on the ground enemies can mostly be defeated in the same manner. Occasionally you’ll encounter a yokai (in the tradition of Japan) or a boss fight; which just had me daydreaming about a version of Ghostwire where every enemy was a starkly different yokai. There’s a universe where this game is more insane with the same basic mechanical groundwork and I want to be there.The elemental combat system mirrors traditional weaponry, but with a “flinging spells out of your hand” spiritual angle. Your core tools involve ranged attacks, starting with the wind variety, and eventually, more traditional elements that have different functions. Akito also gets a bow and arrow early, on top of a few items like stun talismans; and he can melee (with the primary function to leech ranged ammo), sneak up and use stealth kills, and block with an energy barrier. Standard stuff, but very flashy looking, including on a PS5, where the particle effects look fantastic. I’m thankful that the ability to swap between visual and performance modes (of which there are several) is basically the norm now.The more you level up and progress with the story, the more tools you’ll get, including weird things like spirit thickets that you can throw down to create a makeshift stealth wall. This whole system is functional at worst, but I wish that the team leaned more into the weird angle than the elemental system that basically replicates different types of weaponry (like a shotgun spread [water], a rocket launcher [fire], or rifle [wind]). In other words, more thickets, less bows.Again, all of this is serviceable at worst, and the level-up system is very slick, helping lift me out of a routine the more I progressed. When consumed, food also ups your maximum HP by a very small amount, which was tough to get used to (normally I’m into saving consumables), but did a great job of getting me to become more actively engaged with combat, even sliding the difficulty up.Whenever I faltered, where Ghostwire consistently won me back is through its visual style and general theming. While The Evil Within was arguably a more uneven game, you can see a lot of its influence in Ghostwire. There are a lot of moments of disorienting shock, where the entire game state is crumbling around you like you were playing Eternal Darkness on GameCube. But now Tango has the benefit of hindsight, eight years of additional design experience under their belt, and the power of modern devices.Ghostwire is constantly throwing very cool looking Lynchian horror split-reality scenes at you, usually during tense moments involving a timer of some sort or a story moment when someone is yelling at you. The game consists of many peaks and valleys, with chill open world exploration followed by a lot of tense moments. A lot of people will find the pacing to be jarring, and it is!Occasionally Ghostwire will get silly, whether it’s through sidequest storylines, the animations of lazy floating cat vendors, or selfie pose/outfit unlocks. A lot of that is bubbling underneath the surface though, clashing with the more dramatic beats of the story and the straightly-played horror elements. What you get in the end is a project where you have to somewhat work to see a lot of the quirkiness underneath the sometimes standard open world veneer.In another world, Tango Gameworks could have potentially stopped making games; but with a fresh new start under the umbrella of Xbox Game Studios, I’m anxious to see what they have in store for us. Ghostwire: Tokyo isn’t for everyone, but it gives us a glimpse into what Tango is capable of, and I hope they push the envelope a little further next time.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowBethesda Softworks and Tango Gameworks present an urban open world full of paranormal adventure, but does this spectral adventure stay sensational?Ghostwire: Tokyo has been an interesting proposal since Tango Gameworks and Bethesda Softworks introduced it at their E3 showcase in 2019. We knew it dealt with paranormal legends in urban Tokyo, but it’s quite the far cry from the intense and visceral horror Tango previously handled in the likes of The Evil Within. Ghostwire: Tokyo is, instead, a far more mysterious and suspenseful thriller built into an open world. While it can sometimes drag under the weight of extra tasks, it is still an incredible, beautiful, and often unsettling overall journey through a ghost and demon-infested Tokyo.Ghostwire: Tokyo begins with protagonist Akito on his way to visit his sister Mari at a hospital when he gets into a deadly motorcycle accident that almost kills him. At the same time, a spirit known as KK is in desperate search of an earthly vessel to possess. Finding Akito just weak enough to be possessed, KK tried to take over Akito only to find that he has some fight left. Akito resists total possession and his body ends up housing both KK and himself. As this happens, a fog sweeps Shibuya, disintegrating all human life so that only their spirits remain. Demons known as Visitors quickly descend upon the spirits to try to take them to the underworld. Because of their sudden living dead state, KK and Akito survive the fog unharmed and KK is able to lend Akito his spiritual power to fight back.The cause of all of this chaos is a devilish fellow known as Hannya, who has engaged in a ritual to attempt to open the gates to the underworld. It just so happens, Akito’s comatose sister is a good catalyst for completing the ritual. KK was also fighting against Hannya before he died. With Akito unable to fight Visitors without KK’s spiritual power and KK unable to survive outside Akito's body, they end up in an uneasy alliance to save Mari and stop Hannya.Once Ghostwire: Tokyo is done setting the stage, it casts you off into the streets of Shibuya, which are beautifully designed. The fog that descended on the city literally whisked all people to nothingness in the middle of their lives. Everything is still active as it was when the incident occurred sans human life and Tango Gameworks does an amazing job of presenting a city full of lights, sounds, hustle, and bustle where all operators and inhabitants suddenly disappeared. Street intersections are often full of car wrecks, music echoes out of nearby bars and eateries, shopping centers sparkle with neon lighting, and clothes, baby carriages, bikes, and other everyday life items are left cattywampus in every corner of the urban sprawl. It’s stark and beautiful at the same time, and accented even more so by Tango’s liberal use of fog and rain, which bend and reflect light and imagery gorgeously.That’s not to say Ghostwire: Tokyo’s city is completely empty. The spirits have pretty much taken over where life once was. Mostly, that can be seen in the form of the Visitors, who take on a number of forms influenced by the lore and mythology of Japanese demons. It begins with blank-faced umbrella-wielding fellows that remind me of Slenderman, but it continues with the likes of wraiths, child spirits, and enormous, ruthless women wielding massive scissors to name a few. You run into a lot of these Visitors frequently, but Ghostwire: Tokyo also does a pretty good job of introducing new and more daunting threats throughout the game.Not all of Ghostwire’s demons are malicious. Some take on the form of more friendly or benign presences. Throughout the city are nekomata cat spirits that run shops and help keep you stocked up on healing food and weapons if you pay the price. There are also Oni mountain spirits, Kodama tree spirits, Kappa water spirits, and a number of further encounters inspired by Japanese lore. Each is well-presented in their encounters and are fascinating takes on common stories. In fact, pretty much most of Ghostwire: Tokyo is a journey through urban and traditional Japanese mythology. Some are more fleshed out than others, but the constant blend of Tango Gameworks’ take on the paranormal into the depths of its massive urban setting is quite fun and often spectacular in terms of visuals and engagement. It even sparsely uses music outside of the environmental sounds except for when encounters call for it, and when the music does come up, it’s quite intense and effective.The only thing I would say drags on Ghostwire: Tokyo’s presentation is that sometimes it tries to do too much and the performance on PS5 seems to suffer a bit for it. The game has both a performance and quality mode, the former prioritizing a high framerate and the latter offering enhanced ray tracing effects while trying to stay at 30 FPS. Quality Mode is gorgeous and wonderful for screenshots, but Performance Mode doesn’t look half bad either. However, there were quite a number of times where even in Performance Mode, a large amount of activity would cause some choppiness. It wasn’t enough to ruin a good time, but the more hectic enemy encounters with a lot going on did chew up the performance a bit. Other than that, it’s a gorgeous game with a gorgeous variety of visuals, sound, and action.The main beat of Ghostwire: Tokyo is chasing after Hannya, fighting off Visitors, and saving innocent spirits. To that end, this game is played like an open world first-person shooter. KK supplies Akito with a number of powers and gear to use in a variety of situations. You begin with wind powers that can be shot like rapid-fire bolts or charged to fire homing bolts, but you get further tools like water and fire elements with their own properties, a bow that can be charged for powerful long-range shots, and talismans that can freeze enemies, distract them, and make them weaker.Killing Visitors means chipping away at their forms to reveal a spiritual core that you can rip out at close or long range to kill them. You can also just blast them to bits with liberal use of your gear. Taking their core heals you, but it takes time to do and can leave you open to damage. That said, there is also stealth in this game and you can sneak up on a Visitor to rip out their core in one strike and even the playing field before fighting the rest. Ultimately, Ghostwire’s combat presents you with a lot of options to go about it and a good variety of threats to keep you on your toes.There’s also the fog. It’s thick throughout the city and keeps you from exploring freely (entering it will damage you until you get out of it). That fog also obscures some of your main objectives, and so you have to head to Torii gates and shrines hidden around the city to cleanse them. Doing so purifies the area of fog, allowing you to explore more of the city and pursue the main quest. It also opens up a multitude of side tasks. The spirits of the people who were whisked away are everywhere in Ghostwire: Tokyo. By using paper dolls, you can rescue those spirits and bring them to one of KK’s friends to save them, supplying you with experience to level up and increase your abilities with your spirit powers and gear.You’ll also find quests from lingering spirits that task you with any number of encounters based on the aforementioned Japanese mythology and lore. Some are more fleshed out and others are simply quick romps. I particularly liked one where we took a ghost train to an ethereal “last stop” where a malicious spirit awaited in a reality-contorting abyss. Ghostwire: Tokyo is at its best when paranormal activity distorts the world in real-time as you are chasing the truth of any given predicament, giving it effects very similar to the best parts of games like F.E.A.R.Unfortunately, not every one of Ghostwire: Tokyo’s side tasks are riveting. There’s one where you have to chase down Tanuki raccoon spirits hidden throughout the city. They can only be recognized by their tail sticking out of common objects they are mimicking. Sometimes, you can pray at shrines to reveal their locations, but you can’t do that with all of them. Ghostwire: Tokyo’s urban sprawl is such a chaotic mess that I found it really hard to spot objects out of place like that. The game also has a ton of other “collectathon” side tasks that I think just drag down the overall pace of the game. They’re still pretty charming, but the sheer amount of them wears out the welcome in an otherwise gripping paranormal adventure.Ghostwire: Tokyo is, first and foremost, beautiful. Its realistic city elements blended with the ethereal and supernatural create a cornucopia of amazing visuals and sound. Even when the hardware struggles to keep up sometimes, it’s never so much so that the game loses that sense of mystery and awe. Just as well, a big part of that is Tango Gameworks’ creative adaptation of Japanese mythology and lore. Their takes on monsters, demons, ghost stories, and various legends come to life in a massive variety of fascinating ways, whether it’s the situations you encounter, the ways you fight against them, or the elements that aid you. I will say it’s a little bogged down in video game chores in the open world. However, when you’re on the trail of the main quest or any given side story, Ghostwire: Tokyo is a compelling adventure worth seeing through to the final spiritual release.This review is based on a PS5 digital copy supplied by the publisher.

VG247,"Tango Gameworks’ departure from survival horror into a more action-orientated setup is pretty and weird – and undermined by its writing and story.Sometimes a game just has a good vibe. It might be one aspect of said game – the art style or in-game world – that really lifts it above everything else, or it could just be that everything bundled together into one package is an exceptionally enjoyable time. In Ghostwire: Tokyo, the vibes are immaculate.It all begins at the Shibuya Scramble, one of the busiest pedestrian intersections in the whole world. Spooky goings on cause everyone to vanish in a dense fog, leaving only their clothes behind, and an army of spectres descends on the Tokyo Ward. It’s up to the formerly-deceased protagonist Akito and the still-deceased-but-not-really sidekick K.K. to merge into one body – spellweaving capabilities quite literally in hand – and get to the bottom of the haunting of Shibuya.Departed creative director Ikumi Nakamura once lovingly described Ghostwire: Tokyo as “spooky” in a memorable E3 speech, and there isn’t a better word to sum up the game. Shop shutters slam for no rhyme or reason as you bound around Shibuya, building interiors rearrange themselves like they’re guts being toyed with, flying shades prowl over rooftops, and the entire thing is watched over by an ominous red moon. Ghostwire: Tokyo really is spooky, then.Making a world devoid of other actual humans feel alive is no easy task. Ghostwire: Tokyo succeeds in making the desolate streets of Shibuya feel vibrant thanks to fleeting events, like a party of ghosts descending on human spiritual remains to drag them into the afterlife, prompting you to race around and save everyone before they’re dragged to hell. There’s also a procession of demons that’ll periodically roam Shibuya, and you’ll need to fight like hell without your ethereal abilities if they find you. Ghostwire: Tokyo’s vertical open world is a new venture for developer Tango Gameworks though, and the growing pains are evident. Lodged around Shibuya are Torii Gates, acting as beacons that suck up surrounding fog when activated, revealing a new portion of the map. The presence of so many towers around Shibuya feels a little wrought at times, as though Tango borrows from open world design from a decade ago without a fresh perspective or a unique spin. If even Ubisoft can grow out of this, you'd expect other studios can, too.
The saving grace of the Torii Gates is that they open up some brilliantly eclectic side stories. Generally initiated by interacting with the spiritual remains of humans that were vanquished by the fog, side missions might have you taking a haunting subway trip to check out a local legend, rescuing a tanuki and his crew after they had a day trip to Shibuya and got separated, or rescuing someone from being treated like a literal dog by their brother. Ghostwire: Tokyo’s side stories are wildly unpredictable, and that’s excellent. 
The writing generally leaves a bit to be desired, though. Akito and K.K. strike up a buddy routine in no time, playing off each other with wry remarks and wit, and you generally don’t go more than a minute in Ghostwire without some remark from one of the pair. Tango’s leading lads only work because they’re playing off each other, however, and you get the sense either one of them would feel relatively one-note and flat without the other. Still, Akito is never without K.K. in his Shibuya hijinx, so there's always that interplay underpinning the game's otherwise spooky tone. The pair are serviceable, but nothing more. Shibuya’s absence of human noise pollution paves the way for otherworldly sounds from the demonic Yokai. And that's for the best, because and Ghostwire: Tokyo’s sound design is exemplary. You’ll hear sinister giggling and turn a street corner to find headless schoolchildren milling about, or scraping like nails along a chalkboard heralding an imposing Yokai dragging scissors with blades the size of swords behind it. It all folds into that sinister spooky vibe that was promised for this game years ago – and the creature sounds meld brilliantly with the PlayStation 5’s 3D audio capabilities, too. The result, deftly weaving together sound and tech like this, is eerie an paranoia that manifests often; you can be looking at an empty street but hear a shutter slam shut or a demon moaning anywhere around you, pinpointing exactly in which direction it's assailing your ears from.Ghostwire: Tokyo is wildly different from anything Tango Gameworks has produced. Gone are the third-person shooter trappings of studio head Shinji Mikami’s Resident Evil 4 that translated so well to The Evil Within, and absent is the dreary, murky art style and creature design that naturally lent itself to the aforementioned survival horror game. This Tokyo-set caper feels like Tango kicking off the training wheels and hitting its stride, putting on a dazzling showcase with brilliant lights and colours, contrasting strongly to the hideous creatures that permeate Shibuya.
Nowhere is the shift from survival horror to action horror more evident than in Ghostwire’s frenetic combat. You’ll duck and weave through outstretched arms and gnashing blades, hitting the block button at the very last second before an attack lands to parry it and earn precious spectral ammo. Your hand then roars to life with wind, fire, or water energy, peppering your attackers with ranged strikes until their spiritual core is exposed in their midriff, and you can rip it from them and send them screaming back to where they came from. 
It’s all absolutely brilliant, the cherry on top of Ghostwire’s absorbing recreation of Shibuya. That the action is regularly confined to tight areas of Tokyo’s backstreets but the fact that it never feels overwhelming or too in-your-face is a great testament to Ghostwire: Tokyo’s combat design. Tango routinely throws a bunch of menacing foes at you, but gives you plenty of tools to have fun with, too – it's a delicate, fun balancing act. The final act of grabbing a Yokai’s spiritual core from range and pulling it out of them is a fabulous way to wrap up each combat instance, as the DualSense controller creaks and whines while you hold down the left trigger. 
Ghostwire: Tokyo is an impressively bold step in a new director for Tango Gameworks, and it pays off beautifully. Tango’s artists and designers are working wonders with zany and menacing creatures, set against the wonderful backdrop of a colour-struck Shibuya. While its leading pair and open world design stumble at times, Ghostwire’s wonderfully weird side stories and engrossing combat, more than pick up any slack and work in harmony with the game's more zany and offbeat elements to create a world that hasn't just got looks, but one hell of a spirit, too.

God is a Geek,"March 25, 2022It took me a while to get used to the gameplay of Ghostwire: Tokyo. Even after finishing the main story, I wasn’t completely sold on it. The aiming is pretty poor, or at least not particularly responsive or tight. Movement is slow unless you adjust the sensitivity, and even then I struggled with getting around effectively, especially in combat. However, despite my issues, I began to enjoy fighting the evil spirits that populated Shibuya, harnessing my range of powers and abilities to rip out their cores and find the evil occultist known as Hannya.Ghostwire: Tokyo is filled with things to do. It’s a good thing, really, as the main story isn’t that long. Although I’d put in a fair amount of time, I felt there was still much to find out. You play as a guy called Akito. After a purge of the population of Tokyo where people’s spirits have been ripped from their bodies, a mysterious wraith known as former detective KK takes over your body. At first, you don’t get on, and it takes a while for the two of you to work together. Throughout the game, you learn more about each other, including details about your families. That is one of the key themes at the heart of everything. Akito’s sister Mari is lying in a hospital bed when the main antagonist Hannya takes her. It’s unclear why at first, but there’re a couple of big moments that reveal his full intentions.As it nears its conclusion, the sibling relationship of Akito and Mari has some heart-breaking revelations. There’s a poignant moment where your backstory plays out. It’s done in such a beautiful way, both in its writing and its visuals that you can’t help but be impressed by the entire design of the game. That’s something that never gets old. The visuals are amazing. Not just because it looks wonderful on PS5, either. The ward of Shibuya in Tokyo is filled with different districts, and by cleansing Torri Gates, you’ll be able to clear the fog and see more of it. Shopping arcades and blocks of skyscrapers, adorned in neon and colour. Despite the eerie presence, the attention to detail is staggering. In many of the indoor settings, Tango has gone to town on making some of the dream-like sequences you encounter pretty special.What I loved most about Ghostwire: Tokyo is the world building. Japanese urban legends are thrown in front of you throughout Tokyo. Some are vile entities that want to kill you. Others are there to aid you. What Tango Gameworks has done well is write a story that makes these paranormal forces play a vital role in everything you do. For starters, the bulk of enemies you fight are Visitors – ghostly apparitions that vary in looks and attacks. Schoolgirls, police officers, businessmen. A quick look at their description and they are all born out of negative emotions and life experiences: a lack of guidance in life, boredom from the mundanity of office jobs; choosing to break instead of uphold the law. They are designed incredibly well.One such being is a woman in a trench coat, wearing a mask and wielding a huge pair of scissors. She utilises her blades to slice at you with ferocity and does serious damage. Other Visitors fire flaming orbs at you, use martial arts, and try to take your soul. They are vicious, yet I couldn’t help but be fascinated by them. Other supernatural creatures that populate the world are Tengus. These flying creatures are there to aid you in your journey. They are always high up in the city’s skyline, and can be ziplined to get you onto rooftops, away from most Visitors. Two-tailed cats known as Nekomata act as convenience store clerks where you can buy various key items in-between ridding the city of evil.Akito’s powers all revolve around Ethereal Weaving. By harnessing the power of water, wind, and fire, you can vanquish enemies by collecting ether and turning it into powerful projectiles. Each one can be levelled up, becoming more effective every time. Wind can be fired in three strong bolts. Fire can be launched into enemies with a wide range of impact. Water can slice through multiple enemies. The main goal is to uncover each Visitor’s core. Once you can see it, Akito must rip it away from the body to destroy the enemy permanently. Sometimes you can sneak up on a Visitor and do it without provoking a fight. Unfortunately, enemies are either completely oblivious or too aware.I would sneak up on someone only for them to turn around and notice me. Other times, they don’t even acknowledge my existence as I go from one to the next purging their cores to my heart’s content. When full scale battles occur, it can be tough to succeed. There’s no dodging or strafing, which makes a huge difference. Enemies will move fast, and the auto-aim doesn’t lock on for the entirety of an attack. I didn’t always use it because it tended to fail when I needed it the most. You almost get used to fighting with these issues, but by then you’re in the closing stages of Akito’s story.Despite these shortcomings, combat can be pretty fun. Sometimes, Akito and KK’s bodies will be separated. This forces you to act smart and pick your battles, as well as making use of the bow and arrow. When you are together and Ethereal Weaving is in full swing, removing cores builds up your ‘Wire In’ meter. Once filled, you unleash a powerful attack that wipes out any Visitors close by, and gives you added power for the duration of its effect. Throughout Ghostwire: Tokyo, you’re given many opportunities to improve your stats. Levelling up improves your skills and abilities. Various prayer beads can be found and equipped which improves your attacks, the effectiveness of consuming food for health, and more. The capacity of your elemental attacks can be permanently improved at Jizo Shrines.There’re even more ways to improve your character, but whether you utilise them or not depends on how much you stray away from the main story and put time into the other activities. As mentioned earlier, there’re plenty of side missions to do, often revolving around helping various spirits scattered across the city. Although there’re no living NPCs, these spirits all have a valid reason for being there. Some of their stories are pretty interesting, too. I never got tired of seeking out optional quests. They reward you with XP, and offer a little respite from the main plot. You can also interact with dogs and cats for additional help or a friendly interaction. By using a paper doll known as a Katashiro, you collect spirits and send them through a phone to one of KK’s friends known as Ed. In return, you’ll get meika (the game’s currency), and XP.Ghostwire: Tokyo is beautifully designed. The city is gorgeous to look at, and the paranormal beings that populate it are equally fascinating. While the story isn’t particularly long and feels like it could have been fleshed out more, I was still intrigued by it. The gameplay isn’t as solid as I’d hoped, especially as some of the fights are quite challenging. Regardless, I was more than impressed by the style present in every inch of its design, and the way the developers have blended in urban legends with slick visuals is more than enough reason to give this one your attention.Beautiful environments
