Eurogamer,"The horse you ronin on.Quite early on in Ghost of Tsushima, you'll be introduced to its dramatic, one-on-one duels. Two warriors, a dozen yards apart, face each other down across the divide. Up close: narrowing eyes and crumpled brows. Hands hover at hips, knees bend, feet press down into the earth, muscle, sinew and fingers tighten. Then - bang! - combat. It's a cracking moment, especially the first time you give one a try, and it's also a cracking example of what Ghost of Tsushima's all about. These heightened standoffs begin with shot-for-shot facsimiles of that famous scene from Yojimbo, an Akira Kurosawa classic that's both a mirror of older westerns and an inspiration for the '60s greats. They're also, once you've done a few of them, slightly flat, the enemies you battle mostly re-using the same attacks and movements of ones you've faced before, and the concept quickly becomes a little overused, predictably occurring at the end of certain quests, and generally lacking the complexity to require more than a few tries each time. Like the game itself, they go for authenticity through facsimile - recreating moments without the requisite weight and context. And, like the game itself, they're lacking a little depth. Despite the immediate and undeniable thrill, the gloss can be just a little too quick to wear off.Still, much of Ghost of Tsushima is enjoyable enough. Developer Sucker Punch has definitely aimed high with its first full-length effort since InFamous Second Son, way back at the start of the generation in 2014. The much-trumpeted inspirations here are the stirring epics of samurai cinema. It's a tough genre to crack, nevermind the potential for awkwardness in an American realisation of feudal Japan. Namechecked directors like Akira Kurosawa, who gets his own grainy, black-and-white mode in Ghost of Tsushima, are known for their lengthy epics of extraordinary nuance, adapting - and arguably mastering - the works of Shakespeare, or chipping away at the great problem of the human condition. Next to inspirations like that, Ghost of Tsushima is never really going to compare. It lacks the nuance and the depth, or the dedication, even, to telling a good story itself - as opposed to telling a story that simply keeps out of the way of the mechanics - and the slack left by its story isn't picked up in those mechanics, either. But it has a kind of Hollywood, popcorn charm, which shouldn't count for nothing.In Ghost of Tsushima you are Jin Sakai, a samurai of noble birth, tasked with almost single-handedly fending off a Mongol invasion of the feudal Japanese island he calls home. In doing so you're forced to evolve, from staid and honourable samurai to the Ghost, master of underhand tactics. And therein lies your central conflict, as the screenwriting gurus would put it: Jin has to defend the people of the island, but he does so at great cost, abandoning tradition, honour, and everything that comes with it. It's a bit of a cliché - and one that happily departs from Sucker Punch's stated aim for authenticity, when you read historians' arguments that for most samurai in feudal Japan, there was no such code of honour at all - but Ghost of Tsushima is good at carrying you along with the drama. It's helped by some stellar voice work from a cracking cast, including a turn from the magnetic François Chau, of Lost fame, as a curmudgeonly master archer Sensei Ishikawa, and an imperious Patrick Gallagher as the big bad Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of that famous one Ghengis. There are some stirring sequences, too, especially when Sucker Punch digs a little deeper into its characters to mine their pockets of rage, or just finds an excuse for another heroic charge, while the family-political intrigue is at least more accurate to the period than the lengthy monologuing on honour and tradition. And there's a stunning, sweeping score to accompany it all, capable of dragging you up from even the deepest mid-game cutscene malaise, carrying you across rolling landscapes and striking wonderfully at the story's noticeable highs. What it lacks is the grit to go with the melodrama. Samurai tales are, famously, much the same as what we'd more quickly recognise as westerns, and as such they're reliant on certain things to really work. One of them is that grit, or rather a sort of tangible earthiness, that comes from a particular grounding in the world. There have been obvious examples of earthy cowboy games recently but the best illustration in this case remains The Witcher 3, which told a similar story of a stoic, semi-outlawed warrior riding into villages and solving problems with his sword, but did so through the immense weight of its world, through the detail and humanity of its side stories and the intimacy of its smaller, quieter moments. There are countless others - Assassin's Creed's now known for its side stories that bring levity, heart and mystery, and the first Red Dead Redemption has even been cited by Sucker Punch as inspiration.This is why Ghost of Tsushima feels so frustrating. Side quests are the beating heart of a good outlaw story, the secret to a great samurai game that so many others not set in feudal Japan have managed to master. For Sucker Punch they seem to have been almost an afterthought. There are effectively four kinds of quest in the game: the main story, one-off side quests, mythic quests, and ""tales"" - multi-step quests - that are tied to a specific named character. The character tales are far and away the highlight - Lady Masako and Ishikawa's standing out among them, thanks to the strength of the performances and melodrama of the stories - but they're sadly over before they really begin, and the actual activities involved are still far too limited. Follow a character, track some footsteps, fight some enemies and maybe grind out some instant-fail stealth sections, onto the next. There's some minor variation on this for the mythic ones but not much - not enough - and the standalone ones are worse, often feeling like a procedural patching together of pre-set objectives and activities, wrapped in the loose-fitting context of another unnamed peasant crying for help from the Mongols. The only reward for your time with them is a nudge of XP or some upgrade materials, as opposed to a chance to really bed yourself into the character or the world itself. They're a huge disappointment.In fact, if you pick at the surface of Ghost of Tsushima it all starts to quite worryingly unravel. The world as a whole is beautiful - utterly, undeniably, oppressively beautiful. Such colour! Everywhere you look, it's crimson, windswept fields and forests of golden yolk. Sunsets and oceans, beaches and snowy mountain peaks - environments of improbable range for a temperate island of Tsushima's kind, set to broad, enrapturing splashes of orange and teal. The vivid green bamboo jungles, the ephemeral fireflies, the swirling, milky petals that rise and fall with the wind - a wind that could be a game of its own, a magic thing bending everything around you. It's a sign of a studio that's mastered the tech, with a console generation's worth of experience behind it, but what it's missing is the maturity or restraint to put it to use. Ghost of Tsushima's bursting with undeniable beauty, yes, but beauty of the obvious, in-your-face kind, the kind that doesn't offer much thematic or tonal subtlety but makes a great ad for HDR OLED televisions. It's an odd thing to find a problem with - an excess of sumptuousness - but Sucker Punch is best imagined here less as master painter than overexcited barkeeper, serving up shot after shot of wincingly concentrated emotion, slamming the table and pouring out another - bigger moon! more falling leaves! make it a double! - before you've gulped the last one down. It's a bit much.More troublesome is the construction of Tsushima's open world, which is technically open but best described as closed. It's a big area - there are three parts to the island, the second and third opening up after you reach the end of the first act plenty of hours in, and they contain all the breadth of those wildly varied biomes outlined above - but the sense of closedness comes from how little mystery there is to it. In fact, there's really no mystery at all, once you get to know the way the game works. Spanning the island are a litany of fixed, more or less identical locations-of-interest, which all involve a set interaction and a set reward (and all of which you'll be led to by the game's clunky, if admirable attempt at using nature for navigation - gallop past a nearby point of interest and a golden bird will appear, piping up incessantly in invitation to follow it to whatever that undiscovered spot may be). Those points of interest never change, though - they never deviate from the set list of things to do that you can check off from lists in the menus. So there are hot springs which you press R2 at to bathe in and increase your max health; fox dens, where you follow a mewling, over-adorable fox to a shrine, which you press R2 at to increase your max charm slots; bamboo strikes, which do at least give you a very brief, quick-reaction button-pressing minigame to beat before their designated reward (there's an accessibility option for turning off the time-sensitive element, if that sounded worrying to you). I could go on, but the point is sooner or later you'll realise this is it. A bird will chirp and, after slavishly following them until now, you'll decide the bird can do one, actually, because it's just going to take you off your path to something you've already seen and done a dozen times before. Even the rarer, more elaborate activities like Shinto Shrines - locations that sit atop mountains and cliffs, requiring a spot of ultra-light, golden ledge guided platforming to reach - start to wear thin after a couple climbs. The result of it all is a busy world, full of activities, but one that soon feels paradoxically empty of things to do. A brighter, if still imperfect part of Ghost of Tsushima is its combat. In melee, Sucker Punch has created a kind of Arkham-Sekiro hybrid, which works relatively well. Enemies all have a guard meter as well as a health meter, which will need to be broken for you to really get in there with the pointy end of your katana and do some damage. Much of your success will come from successfully countering, as is the Arkham style: you can dodge and perfect dodge, dodge-roll, parry, and perfect parry, all of which feel snappy enough - although I'd like some attack-cancelling to feel a tad sharper. And while there are unblockable enemy moves, marked with a red symbol - hello Sekiro - most of these can be turned into parryable ones with an early upgrade in the skill tree (Ghost of Tsushima has something between seven and ten skill trees, depending on how you look at it - don't ask), which unfortunately takes away much of the tension and skill. Where it gets interesting is stances: there are four stances in the game, each granting new heavy attacks effective at breaking the guards of a certain type of enemy. You unlock them and their respective skill trees one at a time - with another slightly repetitive open world task of killing certain numbers of Mongol leaders - but once you do the combat gets noticeably more interesting, becoming a much more conscious exercise. At its most satisfying, you'll be facing swollen numbers of varied enemies, requiring you to rapidly switch between stances as frequently as every enemy attack, so as to clash swords, break shields, charge archers, parry spears and slash brutes as effectively as possible. In these moments of intimate violence, the music soaring, enemies cowering and crumpled, Jin clad in some imperious armour lashed with rain and soaked in mud, Ghost of Tsushima feels glorious, and also truest to its soily roots. The problem is they come too rarely - there are a smattering of climactic battles in the story that open with a bang, before swiftly fizzling out - and too late, with the enemies only getting really varied and dense towards the end and the game falling into the usual RPG-lite trap of dishing out its most enjoyable gimmicks after a load of time without (or hiding them behind mythic quests, some of which are only accessible after certain points of the story). It struggles with the camera, which sits too low and close over the shoulder, and doesn't come with an option to lock onto an enemy. It sounds minor, but can result in annoying hits from enemies out of shot, an awkward inability to act and look around at once, or worse still a totally obscured camera altogether, if you get too close to an object or wall.Ghost of Tsushima's stealth, meanwhile - which is prominent enough to be the driving force of its story, and technically half of your own arsenal - is frustratingly unsystemic and largely underbaked. It's very much stealth-lite, closest to modern era Assassin's Creed with even fewer toys, and so you'll be frequently defaulting to the usual suspects: X-ray vision, throw a jingly distraction bell, pop a smoke bomb if you get in trouble and try again. All of that couples meekly with a range of insta-fail stealth missions and yet another selection of excessively crunching, crackling and squelching neck stabs.It's desperately frustrating, because I maintain that Ghost of Tsushima is still, largely, quite fun. The problem is it's an easy, breezy, lite beer kind of fun - the kind that Sucker Punch is known for, after all - and the blanket genericism of it just doesn't sit well against such a po-faced tone. It's another game fallen victim to the palatability blender, coming out the other side as a slightly formless smudge of every genre, without a mastery of any. Going back to Ghost of Tsushima's roots, as an American game inspired by the comics and the movies of Japan, in a way it's quite apt. It's what happens when you want to pay homage, but don't want to add anything new of your own. It's Hollywood.

Your eyeballs aren't ready, your life isn't ready, your soul isn't ready. No matter how much of a Sucker Punch fan you are, no amount of playing the Infamous series could have prepared you for this epic game. It's Assassin's Creed Japan with a Red Dead Redemption 2 sized world and an entire library's worth of Akira Kurosawa movies melted and shot directly into its veins. After days and days spent wandering forests, decapitating warlords, and stopping every now and again for a little toot of my flute, I still wanted more when the breathtaking finale signaled the end of Jin Sakai's story.Release date: July 17, 2020
Platform(s): PS4
Developer: Sucker Punch
Publisher: Sony Interactive As with many powerful drugs, the effects of the game didn't hit me until a few hours in. The prologue is beefy and a little slow, introducing samurai Jin, the survivor of a terrible battle with the invading Mongols, now desperate to rescue his uncle Lord Shimura from captivity. At first, Jin seemed like just another stony-faced video game hero, and one I felt zero chemistry with. By the final scene, I had to wipe away a tear. Jin never really got my heart racing, but the stories of the people around him did. Lady Masako, the matriarch of clan Adachi who is full of anger and secrets, thief Yuna and her brother Taka, the warrior monk Norio whose grief threatens to swallow him whole. As their tales develop, one chapter at a time, you fall deeper and deeper into the world. Quests come in various flavors, the main quest to save your uncle, those that revolve around a cast of allies, smaller side quests, and Mythical quests to learn special combat techniques. The stories are delivered in punchy chapters, which helps them feel more organic, less of a linear chore, and the performances really drive the stakes home. The horrors of the Mongol invasion hit differently when it's your friends' necks on the line. The game starts you off gently with combat, which is all about mastering your katana. Bows and bombs will play a part, but the real satisfaction comes from a perfectly timed parry or a flashy special power that slices through your enemies like they're made of butter. As you dodge and strike and parry, you build Resolve, which can then be used to perform special attacks and heal in the middle of battle. And you're going to need to heal, a lot. Ghost of Tsushima's samurai rabbit roots, fox petting, and commitment to authenticityIn the opening hours of Ghost of Tsushima, I was hacking away like a butcher at any Mongols that got too close and paying the price for my clumsy mistakes. Soon, I learned the art of timing, how to use stances (easily swapped with the R2 and face buttons, and essential to make it easier to break through different enemy type's defences) and when to just get out of the way of an unblockable attack. By the end, the combat flowed like a dance, knew just when to throw out a kunai or ignite my sword to deliver fiery death, and learned to dodge attacks like I'd developed Spidey sense. I am not traditionally a fan of nuanced combat, approaching everything like a tank with PMT, but with Ghost of Tsushima, it just flowed and felt right. Not that it was ever easy, true to Sucker Punch's promise that a few mistakes can leave you crushed by a brute enemy even late in the game, so even random encounters require your full attention.As well as large battles there are more nuanced duels, where your smoke bombs and bow are stripped away, and you face an enemy with just your sword. These usually mark a key moment in the story. Framed like a movie scene, you'll be torn between survival and grabbing a perfect screenshot. The real star of Ghost of Tsushima isn't its hero Jin Sakai, it's the island that unfurls around you. Sucker Punch has delivered on its promise of using the natural world as a guide, with the wind's direction leading you to waypoints, golden birds showing the way to hidden secrets like bamboo strikes and hot springs, and foxes shepherding you to Inari shrines. With fields of pampas grass, bamboo forests, lakes, and mountains, it's like running through a painting - and with a few exceptions - everything is so colorful, so vivid, that running between quests is like a pharmaceutical strength ASMR video. You can fast travel, but you'll find you don't want to. Somehow, between the adventures and enemy bases and Mongol patrols, the world finds space for moments of quiet. There are places to stop and compose a haiku, hot springs where, after a flash of butt, you're asked to reflect on your relationship with your uncle or a recent event. There are other shrines that sit atop mountains and require a steady foot and a grappling hook to get to, and banners hidden away just begging to be collected. It's more than just set-dressing too, everything has a purpose. You'll get a new item, like a headband, or a saddle, or your Resolve will increase, or your maximum health. Even playing your flute - for which you can earn new melodies by seeking out singing crickets - changes the weather. It's like the world of Ghost of Tsushima has its own language that you learn to recognize, making flipping to the world map almost entirely redundant. The only complaint, which is just highlighted by the richness of the world elsewhere, is that  occasionally you'll find an area that feels like there should be more there, an empty village or Mongol camp, where the story will almost certainly take you later. You can still search for supplies and secrets in the empty buildings, but it feels like wandering onto an empty stage. In the third act - no spoilers - you're suddenly in an area that feels bleak compared to the riots of color and activity in the first and second act, and it's like being plunged into a cold bath. Yes, it marks a twist in the tale but... it's just not as much fun. These are minor complaints in a game that gave me packed days and nights of adventure and storytelling, made me shed a tear and Google grief support groups, and gave me a new love for the history and traditions of feudal Japan. There's so much to do, such fervent, visible love for the subject matter - from the ink brush artwork that appears in cutscenes when you're hearing a mythical tale, to the Kurosawa Mode filter that paints the world in a cinematic monochrome and was given the blessing of Akira Kurosawa’s estate. It would be understandable for developer Sucker Punch to feel nervous about releasing a game so close to the critically-acclaimed The Last of Us 2, and as PS5 glimmers on the horizon, but it shouldn't. This is a worthy swan song for the PS4, and a tribute to the Japanese culture it so clearly reveres. We reviewed Ghost of Tsushima on a PS4 Pro.Rachel Weber is the US Managing Editor of GamesRadar+ and lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Metro GameCentral,"What will probably be the last ever big budget PS4 exclusive is an open world adventure in the world of medieval Japan.Considering Japan’s enormous influence on the video games industry an outside observer would assume that games based in medieval Japan were commonplace, especially given how well suited it is to a video game setting. But while references to samurai, and the mythology surrounding them, does turn up in many games there are close to zero that offer any kind of non-fantastical take on the era. And oddly the first big budget attempt is by a Western developer.Although Sony are, obviously, Japanese, Ghost Of Tsushima is the work of Sly Racoon and Infamous developer Sucker Punch, who are based in Washington. Their fascination with the setting, and especially Japanese-made samurai movies, is very clear but it’s interesting how obvious it is that a Western studio is behind the game. Not because of any gross lack of authenticity but simply because the gameplay is so very similar to other established, Western-made, open world games.There’s always been a lot of talk about PlayStation exclusives being part of the ‘Sony formula’ but Ghost Of Tsushima leans more heavily on the even more ubiquitous Ubisoft formula. For year fans have been saying that one of the Assassin’s Creed games should be set in medieval Japan and this is pretty much that game. It’s notably more refined in terms of production values and combat but whether that excuses the lack of major innovation is open to question…When we compare the game to Assassin’s Creed we’re talking the pre-Origins games, without any role-playing elements. In Ghost Of Tsushima you can unlock new skills and abilities with earned experience points but it’s nowhere close to being classed as even an action role-player. Instead, it’s an open world adventure in which you seek to liberate the island of Tsushima, off the north west coast of the mainland, from the first Mongol invasion of Japan in the 13th century.You’re cast as an idealistic young samurai named Jin Sakai, who gives himself the initial goal to rescue his uncle (the only other surviving samurai from the initial assault) from imprisonment. If you’ve ever played an open world Ubisoft game you’ll immediately be able to imagine how that’s achieved, as you liberate Mongol outposts, attack patrols, and take part in missions that range from vital story quests to optional tasks involving either close allies or the ordinary peasantry.There’s a wide array of smaller tasks, from following foxes to reveal secret shrines – that unlock additional slots for perk-like charms – to some simple puzzle-platforming to retrieve the charms themselves. Although the main story can be beaten in 30 hours or so the game can easily last two or three times that with the amount of content it has.If you’re currently groaning in dismay at the thought of yet again going through such well-rehearsed motions there are three factors which make Ghost Of Tsushima interesting: the excellent production values, the highly enjoyable combat, and the fact that, to not put too finer word on it, samurai are cool.We’re sure many tedious YouTube videos will be made about exactly how good the graphics are, including entirely inappropriate comparisons (considering it’s not open world) to The Last Of Us Part 2 but while Ghost Of Tsushima isn’t as good looking as Naughty Dog’s game (or Red Dead Redemption 2) the facial animation is still excellent and the sense of scale and the detailed, constantly moving, foliage is very impressive.There does seem to be something slightly up with the lighting at times though, which can seem very flat during daylight – to the point where it seems a patch might be in order (predictably, a day one update is already promised). The art design is enough to compensate either way though, and it’s the huge fields of brightly coloured flowers that stick in your mind as much as any technical accomplishment.There’s no element of Ghost Of Tsushima that doesn’t come with a caveat like that and the one for the combat is that the system lacks depth and by the end of the game feels highly repetitive. And yet it never stops being fun, with a great sense of speed and power that comes from the superb animations and the knowledge that both you and your opponents can usually be killed with just a few blows.The combat is by no means entirely shallow, as while there’s only a small number of extra moves beyond the basic light and heavy attacks you do have to adopt different stances in order to combat enemies with different weapons. You only ever get to use a sword though and on the default difficulty it’s possible to beat almost every enemy simply by spamming the heavy attack, when you’ve got the right stance, and break the enemy’s guard.At times Ghost Of Tsushima almost feels like a Streets Of Rage style brawler, especially when there’s computer-controlled allies fighting alongside you, hinting at how much fun a co-op version would be. This is not that type of game though and that’s unfortunate because despite the huge range of things to see and do there’s not much real variety to any of it. There are no puzzles, the rare bouts of platforming are very simplistic, and there’s only half a dozen dialogue choices in the whole game.What there is instead though is stealth, with the central premise of the game’s story being Jin’s choice between following the strict samurai code or engaging in more underhand strategies. This is the entire thrust of the game’s interpersonal conflict but it’s not set up at all well, with the game making strangely little attempt to establish what the samurai code actually is (concepts such as bushidō and seppuku were not standardised until centuries later).Like most recent historical games, Ghost Of Tushima takes place in an alternate history where sexism never existed and everyone seems to have suspiciously modern ideas about equality, and yet it makes little attempt to critique the samurai as an institution. Rather than an overbearing aristocracy, the game would have you believe that most genuinely were eager public servants, ready to sacrifice all for the common folk, and that seems purposefully naïve.The game eventually makes it clear that any kind of subterfuge, or attempt to destroy the enemy through anything other than direct combat, is frowned upon. Although this is couched in distractingly modern terms, with talk of ‘acts of terror’ and how Jin shouldn’t stoop to using the tactics of the enemy. Although the central premise, of illustrating how the ethics of warfare are not merely a modern consideration, is interesting.The cost of victory, and what you’re willing to sacrifice in order to succeed, is the main theme of the game, but the problem is that, unlike The Last Of Us, these are not questions you wrestle with during gameplay. Only the Mongol leader gets any characterisation and since all he wants to do is invade Japan he’s not exactly sympathetic. So really, the only decision you struggle with as a player is whether you want to make things more difficult for yourself by not employing stealth tactics.Not only did bushidō not exist in the 13th century but neither did the concept of ninja, which increasingly makes you wonder whether Sucker Punch just picked the wrong time period to set their game in. You do get a lot of ninja style gear to make use of, such as kunai and smoke bombs, but the stealth gameplay itself is absolutely bog standard and no different to Uncharted or The Last Of Us, including the inability to move bodies. It’s still fun, but unlike the combat there’s really nothing unique about it.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNo matter how many times Sucker Punch pay homage to the ending of Sanjuro, or Akira Kurosawa’s very particular way of filming rain, it can’t stop Ghost Of Tsushima feeling like just another open world game with a different hat on. We enjoyed it more than Days Gone, but not by much and your your mileage will vary largely based on how interesting you find the setting.We’re sure nobody expected another Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice but Ghost Of Tsushima is so predictable, in terms of gameplay and plotting, that it begins to spoil the fun. As we enjoyed the lushly detailed landscapes we couldn’t help but wish the game had either been set further forward in history or perhaps had a supernatural element that took advantage of Japan’s fascinatingly unique mythology. Having some yōkai wandering around would certainly have spiced things up, but the game is far too strait-laced for that.In the end, like most games that follow the Ubisoft formula, it just ends up feeling like a patchwork of ideas from other games, some implemented well and some less so. We certainly enjoyed it more than most Assassin’s Creed games but we’d consider that a fairly modest achievement in its own right. Ghost Of Tsushima is a competent, enjoyable action adventure but it’s never any more than that. If it does end up being the last major first party exclusive on the PlayStation 4 it’s a fairly forgettable ending.In Short: A competent but shallow and overfamiliar attempt to replicate Assassin’s Creed style open world adventure in the world of 13th century samurai.Pros: The period atmosphere is excellent, with a beautiful open world and lots of attention to detail. Highly enjoyable combat, that feels authentic without being overcomplicated.Cons: None of the gameplay elements, including the combat, have any real depth and they fail to properly support the main themes of the story. Very formulaic structure and mission design.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 4Price: £54.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: Sucker PunchRelease Date: 17th July 2020Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter

Game Informer,"Most great games stand on the shoulders of their predecessors. Ghost of Tsushima unabashedly borrows many of its strongest features from other open-world adventures, and executes on them with skill. The game owes a tremendous debt to the Assassin’s Creed games; in many ways, Ghost of Tsushima feels like an entry in that franchise set in Japan – something that fans have longed for. But it’s unfair to paint Sucker Punch’s immense samurai epic as a copycat. By tapping into Japanese art, history, and culture, as well as the samurai film tradition that followed, Ghost of Tsushima finds a wholly original tone within the gaming landscape. Across an especially vast adventure, players are treated to a tale about the contradictory ideals of honor and revenge, and one in which tense katana duels and quiet moments of reflection claim equal focus.Structurally, Ghost of Tsushima is an adventure told in three acts, each almost wholly dedicated to one geographical section of a massive island. Astride your loyal horse (whose name you select early on), you gallop between Mongol-occupied forts, idyllic Buddhist temples, and remote mountaintop shrines, gradually ticking off completed locations as your honor-sworn warrior grows in power and acquires new weapons and tools. From convenient fast-travel options to smart delineations of mission types, you always know what you’re working toward and how to move forward. Side missions and distractions are plentiful, and full engagement with the bulk of the content is a project of 50+ hours.As the survivor of a doomed samurai charge to hold off a Mongol invasion, Jin Sakai is a conflicted and tortured hero. Trained to be the best of his samurai caste, the tension between his familial duty and the need for justice forms the heart of the story. A small but richly drawn cast of allies surrounds him – each flawed in their own way – who are coming to terms with their warring natures. The interwoven stories that unfold carry very little lightheartedness or humor, instead opting for a somber contemplation on the horrors of war. They portray a mother’s grief for her murdered grandchildren, the weight of survivor’s guilt, and the loss of innocence when we perceive our heroes’ failings. As a player, moments of true victory are rare – try to save a man’s family, only to find his wife and child are already dead. The game is a meditation on suffering, and I was surprised by Sucker Punch’s uncompromising adherence to that vision.Rather than counter that form with levity, Ghost of Tsushima finds relief in nature’s beauty. The island of Tsushima is an exaggerated and painterly vision of feudal Japan, where gently curving cherry trees blow endless blossoms across windswept fields of pampas grass. Set a new objective marker, and the breeze shifts direction to take you to your destination. Birds and foxes emerge to guide you to hidden hot springs and shrines. Especially impressive weather effects set the mood, from ghostly fog-shrouded forests to thunderstorms that presage moments of conflict. Scattered mats invite you to sit and craft poetry with a dedicated haiku mechanic. The artistic presentation, alongside one of the best scores in recent memory, make for a world well worth fighting to save, which makes its desecration feel especially perverse.The invading Mongol army and its stoic commander, Khotun Khan, emerge as fearsome antagonists, ably subverting Japanese defenses by taking advantage of the samurai’s guiding code. The Khan’s tactics and brutality are especially heinous, and you’ll be almost as eager as the protagonist to bring him down. His minions may not have the same narrative depth, but their varied weapons, attack patterns, and appearances keep the moment-to-moment encounters exciting and challenging, even late into the game.In encountering the enemy, players balance two competing playstyles. The first is a particularly smooth and gratifying melee combat system, focused on wielding the katana in a variety of stances. Battles are deadly and precise, and the focus on defensive parrying is a fun challenge. With a dedicated stance for each primary enemy type, combat demands observation of your enemy and quick reaction time. Sophisticated animation work lends a cinematic quality to the fast-paced battles.The second approach to combat takes Jin down the questionable path of infiltration and assassination. Over time, several tools enhance the options here, letting players mess with the enemy or terrorize them into flight. Both approaches are deeply satisfying; you don’t face consequences for being sneaky instead of straightforward, so it’s not about picking one or the other. You choose your tactics based on what is most appealing to you in a given encounter.Both styles of play are supported by a robust set of upgrades, many of which provide meaningful new options. I love how the progression front-loads the things you really want for your character into the first half of the game, like parrying blows and deflecting arrows. However, this also means you spend points on things you don’t especially care about later on. On the bright side, the game reserves a couple of its coolest new powers, ability-infused armor sets, and cosmetic options for the late-game, so I remained engaged with progression even after my core tree of upgrades had been mostly filled.The “tales” that take you between one encounter to the next are mostly enjoyable, and certainly plentiful. Every one of the main narrative missions feels distinct, often presenting rousing large-scale battles and honorable one-on-one duels. The dedicated and multi-part tales for each of your allies are equally worthwhile, telling personal and pathos-laden stories of loss. A third variety of minor tales about the citizens of Tsushima pale in comparison; they grow repetitive, but they’re mostly there for players who simply desire more time in this gorgeous world. My only notable frustration was with occasionally unclear objectives or targets focused on tracking or investigation, leading to moments of fruitless circling of an area until I happened upon the next marker.Beyond these structured missions, thorough map exploration leads to many enjoyable discoveries, from health-boosting hot springs to hard-to-reach shrines that provide new charms to enhance your abilities. I appreciated the many hidden caves and hideaways the map had in store, and I liked the opportunity to do some relatively simple platforming. However, traversal and climbing challenges often trace very static paths, with little freedom to chart one’s own course, and I sometimes found those sequences a bit simplistic.Ghost of Tsushima captures the mystique, fierce violence, and barely contained emotional angst of the great samurai films. The line of inspiration is clearly purposeful; Sucker Punch included a gorgeous “Kurosawa Mode,” which sets a black-and-white, film-grain, audio-treated effect that doubles down on the classic cinematic vibe. It’s well worth turning on, if only for a few missions. But even beyond that cool feature, this is a game that nails the aesthetic it’s shooting for, firmly establishing itself as the medium’s defining samurai saga.

Polygon,"Filed under:A great setting let down by rote design Ghost of Tsushima, the new open-world adventure from Infamous developer Sucker Punch Productions, has a wonderful asset in the island setting that gives the game its name. This fictionalized version of Tsushima is a vast, beautiful place thankfully not limited by strict adherence to historical or geographical accuracy, but instead tinged with myth and magic. Unfortunately, the gameplay that takes up your time on Tsushima is overly safe and familiar, resulting in a game that’s packed with lovely spots to discover and offers moments of peaceful reflection, yet still struggles to differentiate itself from numerous other open-world adventures.Ghost of Tsushima begins as an era of stability and prosperity for the samurai ends. The game is set in 1274, the year of the first Mongol invasion of Japan. The intelligent and brutal Mongol chieftain Khotun Khan, a fictional figure positioned here as the grandson of Genghis Khan, aims to use the island of Tsushima as a strategic foothold from which to conquer the Japanese mainland. Though wildly outnumbered, the samurai of Tsushima gather for an all-out assault on the Khan’s forces, and most of them meet their deaths. However, one young samurai, Jin Sakai, is rescued and nursed back to health by a peasant thief named Yuna. Desperate to save his people, Jin becomes caught between the ideals of honor his uncle has spent a lifetime teaching him, which dictate that a samurai always face his enemies openly and fairly, and the lessons Yuna teaches him, that such honor is a luxury not all can afford, and that to face the Mongol forces head-on can mean only defeat and death. Both lessons are correct, just as both lessons are wrong.Though we see young Jin being taught that a samurai must control his emotions, he is thankfully no stoic hero. He remains open enough about his feelings that we understand how difficult the path that he follows throughout the game becomes for him. He’s assailed both from within, due to his belief that a samurai must conduct himself honorably at all times, and from without, due to the people he loves who still cling to those old ideas expressing their disappointment in his actions. Jin’s first stealth kill is almost traumatic for him, and it’s clear that it will be hard for him to live with the dishonor of killing from the shadows. I was performing stealth kills left and right soon enough, however, since games rarely let the feelings of regret shown in cutscenes slow down the violence of the action itself.Still, we understand the personal sacrifice he is making to break with the traditions he has known his whole life as he assumes the identity of the Ghost, a vengeful warrior who resorts to these “dishonorable” measures — stabbing foes in the back, poisoning their drinks, whatever it takes — to protect and liberate his people. He’s doing his best in the fiction of the game, but the only way for him to be effective is to operate in ways that go against every ounce of his training. Such morally ambiguous heroes are commonplace, of course, but the particular weight of honor and tradition Jin bears allows Ghost of Tsushima to navigate this well-trodden territory in a way that feels distinctive and appropriate to the game’s setting. Jin does what he feels he must to protect Japan from its would-be conquerors, and for it, he ultimately pays a heavy personal price. Ghost of Tsushima’s tale isn’t one of unambiguous victory or triumph. The samurai films of director Akira Kurosawa, after all, which Ghost of Tsushima expressly pays homage to, may be a lot of things — funny, thrilling, and often tragic — but they were never comforting stories with upbeat endings. Right off the bat, in fact, Ghost of Tsushima asks if you’d like to play in what it calls Kurosawa Mode, a black-and-white filter “inspired by the movies of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa,” making it clear from the get-go that its vision of feudal Japan owes at least as much to cinema as it does to history. It’s a bold claim, but the attention to detail in Ghost of Tsushima, particularly in its world and costumes, is meticulous enough that the game earns the right to name-drop the master. Well, with one small but significant exception. Kurosawa Mode automatically turns on the game’s Japanese dialogue option, with English subtitles. However, with all the dramatic close-ups the cutscenes indulge in, it’s impossible to ignore that the characters’ lips are synced to English dialogue, not Japanese dialogue. I wish the developers had taken that extra step and modeled the characters against the Japanese voice-over. Let people who opt for the English dialogue deal with the lip movements being out of sync; after all, it would only contribute to the feeling that you’re watching a Japanese film dubbed into English. The way it’s handled now is a strange choice considering how hard Sucker Punch worked to create a sense of authenticity in most other areas of the game.As much of a sucker as I am for a good film-grain effect, though, I didn’t want to miss out on the bold colors of Tsushima. I did keep the Japanese dialogue option, however, especially since the actors give their lines the sort of heightened dramatic energy you’d expect from a tale of honor, betrayal, and bloodshed such as this. Jin travels across the island of Tsushima, hoping to save it by gathering what few allies remain to aid him in his battles against a formidable enemy. Sucker Punch convincingly sells the idea of a small force going up against overwhelming odds. Before many battles, Jin and his allies will scout the enemy defenses, determining how best to use what little military strength they have to exploit any of their opponent’s weaknesses. I appreciated that Ghost of Tsushima took the time to make me feel attached to its characters, so that the stakes of what Jin and his allies are fighting for mean something. I enjoyed the honest, revealing conversation over bottles of sake between two comrades-in-arms the night before an overwhelming siege they knew they might not survive — almost as much as I enjoyed the battle itself.In fact, it’s the moments between characters that I’ll remember most about my time with Ghost of Tsushima. There are strings of side quests that give you the opportunity to spend time with your closest allies, and though the combat scenarios that pepper these quests are unremarkable, the conversations between characters as you walk or ride from one spot to the next make them worthwhile.I valued these quests not for the chance to fight yet another predictable battle, but for the insight they offered into these people’s lives and their philosophies. Particularly memorable are a few quests you can do with Yuriko, Jin’s childhood caretaker, now an elderly woman he has enlisted for her knowledge of poisonous flowers. Her quests offer an opportunity for reflection on memory, decline, and impermanence, and they tie in beautifully with the natural splendor of the island itself.With its quasi-historical setting and its open world filled with activities and upgrades, comparisons to the Assassin’s Creed games are inevitable, so let’s not beat around the bush: Ghost of Tsushima is extremely reminiscent of many entries in the Ubisoft action franchise and other, similar open-world games, both in terms of its combat and its structure. If you like maps with a lot of icons on them offering up things to do, you’re going to be very happy with this game. This is a world that, for better or worse — worse, if you ask me — lays itself out for you like a buffet crying out to be consumed. Everywhere you go, you’re liable to hear the telltale chirp of a golden bird, eager to lead you to yet another of the game’s hundreds of points of interest, where another collectible or another opportunity for incremental progress toward some upgrade awaits. Look, I’m a simple woman. If a golden bird wants to lead me somewhere, I want to follow. If there’s a question mark on my map, I want to find out what it is. But with those aforementioned birds, who chirp at you all the time — with its genuinely overwhelming number of artifacts, written records, crickets, banners, saddles, sword kits, headbands, masks, charms, and other items to collect — Ghost of Tsushima is overeager, desperate even, to constantly make me feel rewarded or to show me that I’m making meaningful progress. This eats away at my ability to see the world of the game as a world rather than as a collection of things to do and grab and earn.Among the points of interest the golden birds want to guide you to are hot springs that offer permanent health increases; shinto shrines that provide very Assassin’s Creed-style environmental platforming challenges you can complete in exchange for charms that confer passive bonuses; and spots where you compose haiku by selecting lines of poetry via multiple choice to earn cosmetic rewards. It’s all thematically cohesive, and the haiku spots are interesting for the way they pull your focus entirely onto a lovely environmental scene as Jin contemplates death or loss or another aspect of the human condition. However, as sometimes happens with games of this type, you encounter the same experiences and challenges so routinely that they start to feel like cookie-cutter bits of consumable content rather than opportunities organically nestled in the environment you’re exploring. The illusion might have been a little stronger if there were just fewer of each activity, making each one more meaningful.It’s a shame that Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t put more trust in its setting, because the real reward for exploring Tsushima could have just been taking in all of its picturesque beauty: a tranquil pond overseen by a statue of the Buddha; a dueling circle in which leaves gently fall, red as blood; a grassy field, its gentleness offset by a single, arrow-riddled corpse. This beauty remains remarkable, but it loses something when the game is always finding ways to say, “Psst! Over here! More progress toward unlocking your next charm slot awaits,” instead of giving you the time and space to stop for a moment and enjoy your surroundings for their own sake. Sucker Punch seems to constantly be trying to lead you away from what the game does well and toward what other media has done well, from the open-world design to the look of the game itself.Ghost of Tsushima’s combat, too, while full-featured in terms of the assortment of stealthy and more overt combat options on offer, is overly familiar. You’ll sneak up on many perfectly positioned enemies to perform stealth kills, then slink back into tall grass that shields you from the gaze of other enemies. You’ll free bears from cages so that they can wreak havoc on their captors and make your work a little easier. You might toss smoke bombs to disappear from sight, or throw a wind chime to distract a nearby enemy. It’s not that these elements are bad, of course. They’re all handled well here, offering the same familiar satisfactions I’ve felt in other, similar games in the past, as I’ve leapt from a rooftop to assassinate an enemy from above or fired an arrow at some explosive barrels. It’s not bad — it’s just rote.Games aren’t designed in a vacuum; they should be in conversation with each other and seek to build on what came before. The problem is that Ghost of Tsushima isn’t interested in doing much building. There’s a superficial samurai aesthetic here, and a very good one, but in terms of the rhythms of battle and the feel and function of the tools at your disposal, the combat, with a few cosmetic changes, could have been taken from so many other games, or put into so many other games, that I could never find the particular soul of this game. Ghost of Tsushima does at least require you to rely on different techniques at different times so that you can’t get overly comfortable with a single approach. A covert rescue mission where you sneak into a castle claimed by the Mongols demands stealth, for instance, while a few large-scale cinematic battles see you openly confronting enemy forces with your most trusted allies at your side, hacking and slashing to get through as many soldiers as possible. Jin never really has to choose between his chosen method of combat and the art of “dishonorable” guerrilla war, but must indulge in both styles at different times, using different tactics. The game’s flair for the dramatic also surfaces in the standoff, an option that’s available to you when you first approach a group of enemies. It’s essentially the equivalent of an Old West gunslinger duel, but with samurai swords. If you opt for it, Jin will call out to his foes, challenging them openly and alerting them to his presence.One enemy will step forward to face Jin. If you release a button at the precise moment the enemy strikes, you’ll fell him with a single slash; if your timing is off, you’ll be gravely wounded. Of course, calling out for a direct confrontation with your opponent may be honorable, but it also alerts him and all of his nearby allies to your presence. These are tense, enjoyable moments of death, violence, and honor.The ghost stance is unlocked at a certain point of the game as well, acting as a mechanical reflection of the legend of the Ghost spreading and striking fear into the hearts of Jin’s enemies. After pulling off certain feats — most commonly by killing several enemies in a row without taking damage — you can activate the ghost stance and send nearby foes into a panic that lets you easily mow a few of them down. It’s a fine reward for skillful play, elevated by its intensely dramatic presentation as the screen fills with red. Boss battles are pure, one-on-one duels that strip away all your tools and require you to rely only on observation and precise timing. You have to understand your enemy’s attack patterns so you can know when to dodge, when to parry, and when to strike. While most encounters made me feel quite overpowered as I threw kunai and sticky bombs at enemies and fired explosive arrows that gave me an edge even over larger groups, my heart was often racing due to the level of focus demanded by these face-offs with Jin’s most dangerous adversaries.Though I’ve completed the main story in Ghost of Tsushima, done numerous side quests, liberated some Mongol-occupied strongholds, collected tons of cosmetic gear, and done several of every type of activity the game offers, there are still vast swaths of my map that remain shrouded. Do I really want to repeat each kind of mission or challenge over and over, until I’ve seen it all? Probably — not because I care to acquire yet another charm that gives me a passive bonus or any other little tchotchke, but because when you strip all that stuff away, the world underneath it is beautiful in its own right, and I want to see what picturesque spots remain waiting to be discovered. I’m playing through the busy work the game presents me for a reward that should have been given much more freely: the ability to just exist in, and enjoy looking at, this gorgeous world.I also love the way Jin looks in his loose-fitting traveler’s attire as he moves across the landscape, his tattered cape blowing in the wind just so, as if he, too, is simply another part of the flow of life and death on the isle. But as much as I enjoy this game’s style, it’s not quite enough. The best open-world adventures of recent years do something that sets their gameplay apart so they can rise above the crowd and hopefully mature the genre. Sucker Punch never found anything in the gameplay itself that would allow Ghost of Tsushima to similarly stand apart, and that’s its largest failing. It feels like a game that’s destined to go on sale, and then perhaps be seen as a slight cult classic as more and more people discover that its derivative play is hiding some serious charm in its visual design and some impressive environmental work.  Ghost of Tsushima has a distinctive aesthetic, after all, but it’s only skin-deep. The core game underneath that alluring exterior is a pastiche of open-world game design standards from five years ago; it lacks a real personality of its own. Ghost of Tsushima offers a lovely world to explore, and there’s value in that, but it should have been so much more than a checklist of activities to accomplish.

   on July 19, 2020 at 6:16PM PDTIf a youthful obsession with Japanese samurai cinema and an audiobook version of Musashi have taught me anything, it's that if you want to be a great swordfighter, having a connection to nature is important. Skill with a weapon isn't purely driven by physical strength and technique, but also by the acuity that comes from observing trees, mountains, and rivers. Something like that.While I can only make guesses as to how inspirational the rural areas of feudal Japan would have been, the scenic island portrayed in Ghost of Tsushima, an open-world 13th-century samurai epic, is one that often stirs something inside me. Beyond being a game centred around flashy sword fights and the journey of Jin Sakai to becoming a proto-ninja, Ghost of Tsushima invites you to lose yourself deeply in its grasslands, forests, and mountains. And though the tasks you're given often aren't as brilliant as the colour of the leaves, there's certainly something wonderfully humbling about just riding your horse through this beautiful environment and taking it all in.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Ghost Of Tsushima Review And what an immediately beautiful world it is, full of bold, saturated colours, grandiose weather effects, and an overabundance of windswept leaves, petals, butterflies, and other small particles that make every location feel alive. The island of Tsushima is a painter's palette; vibrant red and yellow forests sit atop inviting green hills by day, blinding sunsets soak everything in a deep orange. At night, bright white moonlight glistens off dark blue lakes and waterfalls to illuminate everything around you. The game has an option to turn everything black and white in order to mimic the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa, but using it forgoes Tsushima's own distinct visual identity.At times, it almost feels as if art direction is trying a little bit too hard to draw attention to itself. And Ghost of Tsushima certainly makes a concerted effort to try and absorb you into its radiant world even further with its deliberate lack of navigational information. There's no option for an on-screen minimap or a compass to see which way you're going, and objective markers are barely there. Instead, the game features an in-world device called Guiding Wind, in which the game's plethora of organic particles will subtly fall towards the location of whatever objective you need to reach. A swipe of the DualShock's touchpad will magically and visibly summon a strong gust that kicks up even more particles in an almost comically self-indulgent way, which acts as a more obvious nudge in the right direction.It's a great system. Without anything to draw your eyes away from your character and the world, the Guiding Wind pushes you to pay more attention to your surroundings, to let you more quickly internalise key landmarks that help you to get your bearings more easily later on, or just to feast your eyes. Other in-world devices, like plumes of smoke, flying songbirds, foxes, Torii gates, talkative non-player characters, and more help to guide (or rather, distract) you toward new activities.A lot of these activities also work in service of making sure you see Tsushima's good side. Foxes will invite you to follow them down charming paths to nearby Inari shrines. Torii gates will lead you to simple but daring-looking platforming challenges that reward you with spectacular vistas. Haikus ask you to sit down and reflect on your picturesque surroundings. Singing crickets will unlock songs for Jin's flute, which let you magically command the dramatic weather at will. You get equipment early on that helps you track down the game's myriad collectables through the Guiding Wind and controller vibration, and some convenient touches like a generous and very quick-loading fast travel system help make Tsushima be an incredibly pleasant place to move through, especially when armed with the game's robust photo mode to take screenshots with. While you do need to enter a menu-based world map if you want to go somewhere specific, without a marker to constantly signal your next objective's location, you definitely get a little less obsessed with taking the most direct route, and feel more naturally inclined to just follow winding roads around mountains and along river banks. Guiding Wind creates a flow that gives you plenty of opportunities to drive your own curious exploration. As an open-world device, it also succeeds in masking the feeling that you're simply being strung along by objective markers, even though that's still exactly what you're doing.That feeling does still come up, unfortunately, when Ghost of Tsushima's quests (referred to as Tales) take hold of the reins. Tales fall back on rote open-world quest structures, where you do things like follow a quest giver to an objective, perhaps having a chat on the way, and veering off the assigned path here isn't allowed. Sometimes you'll be asked to survey or examine an environment, activities which have the ability to devolve into meticulous hunts for interactable hotspots. Some early Tales have you chasing macguffin after macguffin to the point of being silly, making you wonder if anything is going to happen at all. Anytime you're not engaged in combat, a lot of these quests, especially side quests, can feel like a drag.The cutscenes that host conversations between Jin and other characters, which give context to these Tales, largely feel stilted, which further underscores the tedium. That's not the fault of the acting--Ghost of Tsushima has some passionate and strong-sounding Japanese voice work, at least to my non-speaker ear, though there is a visible disconnect with character lip-syncing, which retains the mocap performances of the (notably all-Asian) English cast. Even though I preferred the Japanese voice audio, the two tracks do offer some differences in regards to their overall tone.The voice work is largely let down by a noticeable lack of bodily expression in the almost motionless character models, meaning you're basically just watching a couple of talking heads most of the time. That's not uncommon to see in titles of this nature, but it is a significant low point in a game that otherwise hits so many stylistic highs. The cinematography, which frames the characters in pleasing ways within the gorgeous scenery, instead does the heavy lifting to make sure these regular moments are at least somewhat pleasing to the eye--though wide shots do draw more attention to the fact that two conversing bodies are standing perfectly still. This means that a lot of the game's emotional arcs and vibrant characters don't hit as hard as they should. Ghost Of Tsushima clearly aims to evoke golden-age samurai cinema in many ways, but it doesn't manage to capture even a tiny amount of their vigor when it comes to exposition--Mifune-level gusto is completely out of the question here.There are some exceptions to this. The primary story quests give the characters involved a bit more freedom to move, and naturally benefit from hosting the more interesting plot threads: that of Jin's inescapable metamorphosis from a by-the-books samurai square to something a lot more unscrupulous for the greater good, and how this change affects the relationship with his loving but uncompromising father figure. The combat encounters here also benefit from some great set pieces, heightened by a strong musical score that helps construct those rousing blockbuster moments that always seem to be able to pull at your emotions, no matter how impartial you're trying to be.Character-specific Tales have a little more to offer too, and see Jin assist his closest allies with their own dire issues. These multi-part questlines can feel like wild goose chases, especially at the beginning of the game, but they all offer their own interesting (and violent) stories of familial bonds, one of the game's major running themes.Mythic Tales are Ghost Of Tsushima's most interesting quest offering, though they are few in number. These are explorations into the slightly more supernatural elements of the world, featuring their own special animated introductions. They attempt to pull away from the direct point-to-point structure of the other quests by asking you to do things like look at a hand-drawn map and use your own deductive exploration to find the objective location, or perform an activity with a simple mechanical twist. They can still feel like wild goose chases, but the rewards for the more involved nature of them are significant--aside from the main questline, this is your other avenue for earning new types of weapons, armour, and abilities, usually after a climactic one-on-one boss duel.Those duels, and Ghost of Tsushima's combat in general, is where the game does successfully evoke samurai cinema. Jin's katana remains your primary weapon throughout the whole game; it can fell enemies in a few quick slices, but likewise, Jin can also die quickly after a few good hits from opposing blades. This means blocking, parrying, and dodging are the main skills you need to learn how to both use and overcome properly, and though there is more leeway than something like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, battles can still be over in seconds if you make blunders. This gives every fight in the game a degree of heart-pounding tension, from the game's first fight to its final, whether it be a lowly bandit or a master swordsman, even in the otherwise rote quests, and no matter what difficulty you're playing on.Combat does a fantastic job at approximating the highly-stylised version of one-versus-many sword fighting as seen in films like Harakiri or the Samurai trilogy, where long standoffs and quick, flourished movements mark the ebb and flow of suspense and excitement. Most encounters can be initiated by triggering a one-on-one standoff, a tense game of chicken where you need to wait until your enemy has committed to an attack and then counter it in the split second afterward, dispatching them in one quick fell swoop. Once that formality has passed, enemies will often try to surround you and attack in tandem, and decisive success often depends on patiently waiting for a clear opening for attack, lest you get interrupted by a follow-up blow. Perhaps you might need to wait for an advance so you can perfectly deflect it and counter, or break someone's guard to stagger them with some decisive heavy strikes--indiscriminate flailing will see you thrown off balance quickly. A Resolve meter, charged by defeating enemies, earns you opportunities to perform devastating special attacks or heal yourself, creating small risk-reward decisions to think about. Regularly changing your active fighting stance (each unlocked after encountering enough enemy leaders) to better handle the different kinds of weapons your opponents are wielding adds to the many considerations you need to make, as do ranged opponents and the extra tools you'll eventually have at your disposal as Jin begins to learn more deceitful methods of combat.Unlike the game's quest cutscenes, Jin's suite of animations, along with the gore and foley associated with combat, do a lot to make the act of sinking a katana into flesh feel meaningful. Flourishes like how Jin returns to stance after a kill, and the graceful movements that accompany a successful parry give everything an observable flow. Switching stances (which slows down time) just before dodging a hit and responding with an advantageous technique feels really good. Taking a step back and watching a video of a good fight you might have just recorded can be like witnessing a well-choreographed action scene. In addition to exploring the world, combat is where Ghost of Tsushima's most transcendent moments lie.But it's not without flaws; combat is sometimes let down by a couple of major factors. When fighting on uneven terrain like staggered rock formations and inclines, the tightly-interlocked cause and effect of parries and blows starts to unravel, resulting in holes where animations occur but their effects are not passed on. The camera can also be an issue; it should be noted that Ghost of Tsushima does not feature an enemy lock-on function as part of its toolsuite. Presumably, this is because enemies are constantly attacking from all directions, and you should always have the ability to react quickly. But continually having to worry about the camera in order to keep an eye on every enemy within attack range, while also thinking about parrying, executing attack strings, switching stances, dodging ranged projectiles, and keeping your health up so you don't die on the next hit can sometimes be a little much--your right thumb will be moving back and forth between the analog stick and the face buttons more than usual.When you're fighting in an open, grassy field, and the camera actually pulls back a bit to frame the dozens of enemies closing in on you, Ghost of Tsushima's sword fighting is absolutely sublime. But conditions aren't always perfect. The biggest camera issues regularly arise when fighting in tight spaces indoors, or in cluttered areas like enemy encampments (of which there are many) where tents, fences, crates, and other such environmental objects exist. Too often you will find yourself in a situation where a solid object will be blocking your vision of Jin, your enemies, or more importantly, your enemy's weapons. All enemy attacks have a visible tell, and in the case of stronger, unblockable attacks, they have distinctive red glints moments before they occur. But much like Ogami Itto's Suio-ryu Wave Slicer in the Lone Wolf and Club series (which begins with Itto lowering his sword beneath water--please bear with me here), if you can't see what your enemy is doing with their weapon, there is very little you can do to prevent your imminent death--and that can be incredibly frustrating. To be fair, you'll also kill people without them ever seeing what you're doing. When Mongol invaders turn up on the coasts of Tsushima, Jin and his honour-stricken samurai cohort find that their new enemies don't play by their overly-formal rules of warfare. Jin very quickly learns to accept that he'll need to adopt more deceitful and vicious tactics to combat the overwhelming occupation of the island, meaning he'll have to get used to hiding in the shadows, stabbing people in the back, and using a variety of tools to give himself an unfair advantage--warfare tactics that were reportedly unheard of in 13th-century Japan.A viable option in most scenarios, stealth is a relatively uncomplicated affair in Ghost of Tsushima. Enemies are often placed in convenient locations and are hard of hearing (nearby neutral NPCs will, hilariously, react dramatically to your actions while enemies stand motionless). In the beginning, it also feels basic to a fault--I remember lamenting the fact that there was no way to hide bodies, even though guards are alerted upon discovering them.But as you quickly earn new Ghost Tools to use and upgrade your Tanto blade for quicker takedowns, it becomes clearer that it isn't a stealth game focussed on barely slipping by unnoticed (though there are a number of annoying instant-fail stealth and tailing quests), but one where you want to see how quickly and viciously you can take down everyone in the vicinity. That ended up justifying the inability to hide bodies, on top of explaining why Jin's footsteps are silent to begin with, and how he managed to already be a fearless climbing master. Even after I had completed the game's main quest, I gained a lot of enjoyment from using the remaining enemy encampments as playgrounds to terrorize soldiers. I'd get creative with distraction tools, use more environmental kills, turn enemies against one another with hallucinogenic darts, and hone my super long-range grenade throwing arm from the safety of a dark rooftop I clambered onto with a grappling hook.Ghost of Tsushima's story hits hard in the game's third and final act, and ends in spectacular fashion. It left me with the same kinds of strong emotions I felt at the end of all my favourite samurai film epics, and had me eager to watch them all again. The game hits a lot of fantastic cinematic highs, and those ultimately lift it above the trappings of its familiar open-world quest design and all the innate weaknesses that come with it--but those imperfections and dull edges are definitely still there. Ghost of Tsushima is at its best when you're riding your horse and taking in the beautiful world on your own terms, armed with a sword and a screenshot button, allowing the environmental cues and your own curiosity to guide you. It's not quite a Criterion classic, but a lot of the time it sure looks like one.Ghost Of Tsushima is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"Ghost of Tsushima is a game of compulsion. Like most open-world adventures, everything is designed to get you to explore what’s over the next hill or across that nearby river. The map is peppered with question marks, many of which surround towns and temples in which you meet allies and upgrade equipment. Helpful diversions like hot springs and fox dens have obvious environmental tells. The wind, a major contributor to the game’s overall aesthetic, literally guides you to objectives. But there’s a big difference between scouring a map to completion and actually having a good time, no matter how obsessive a person you may be.The story opens with Japan on the brink of war. A small group of samurai have gathered on a Tsushima beachhead to repel an invading Mongol force led by Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of Genghis and Kublai Khan. While the Mongols attacked Japan on multiple occasions, Ghost of Tsushima liberally combines various historical and cultural artifacts for an entirely new narrative. As was the case in the late 13th century, the samurai find themselves unprepared to deal with the invaders’ overwhelming military tactics and get almost completely annihilated.Ghost of Tsushima puts you in control of Jin Sakai, one of the island’s last remaining samurai. A half-dead Jin is pulled from the battlefield by a wandering thief named Yuna, only to rush off in an attempt to free his captured uncle. Jin makes it his mission to save his home from the invaders, who have wasted no time in running roughshod over Tsushima as a prelude to their attack on the Japanese mainland. For the player, this translates to random battles throughout the countryside and liberating villages occupied by the Mongols, sometimes with Jin’s allies but mostly on your own.Jin is a blank slate in the early hours of Ghost of Tsushima, with only brief flashbacks to his time learning from his uncle as any indication of who he is under his gruff exterior. As an idealized image of the samurai warrior caste that existed in Japan at the time, he spends a lot of time worrying about the dichotomy of honor and shame. But it soon becomes abundantly clear that Jin must adopt new tactics, even those he views as “dishonorable,” to liberate Tsushima, adding a thin layer of internal strife to the more overt conflict against the Mongols.This aspect of Ghost of Tsushima gave me pause when developer Sucker Punch Productions showed off early previews. Samurai have been extensively mythologized in modern times, reimagining what was essentially the paramilitary arm of a system of feudal land ownership as noble, superhuman dispensers of justice. Before playing the game, I imagined this stereotypical concept would tie into some weird, Mass Effect-esque morality system by which the main character would vacillate between “honor” and “shame” depending on how he approached every situation.Thankfully, that’s not the case, even if the game’s narrative tunnel-visions on the concept. There’s no penalty for approaching battles in Ghost of Tsushima stealthily, which Jin considers a violation of samurai code. You don’t get locked out of any skill trees or storylines depending on how you decide to fight. While Jin is forced to take a more stealthy approach for both tutorial and narrative reasons early on, there’s also nothing stopping you from proudly walking into an enemy encampment and challenging dozens of Mongols to a straight-up fight. Sure, the best approach will always be a mixture of traditional katana skills and more “underhanded” tools like smoke bombs and firecrackers, but the game never punishes you for living out your own personal version of Seven Samurai.That enduring image of a lone warrior surrounded by foes becomes a neat gameplay mechanic in Ghost of Tsushima. When approaching a group of enemies, Jin can call out to them with a challenge for one-on-one combat against their strongest fighter. Here, the game asks you to hold the Triangle button and keep a close eye on your opponent. When they make a move, that’s your cue to release the button, which causes Jin to unsheathe his sword and unleash a deadly, one-hit kill. By the end of the game, a combination of skills and armor made it so I could slice through five enemies in a row before actually starting a battle, which proved to be a boon for some of the more difficult dust-ups.Ghost of Tsushima’s swordplay is basic and engaging, a mixture of light and heavy attacks, parries, and dodges, tied to specific buttons or button combos. The combat system is very easy to grasp if you’ve played any recent video game, perhaps as a way to indicate, through gameplay, that Jin has been learning to fight with a katana since he was a child. As the game goes on, you learn various stances—combat styles that you can shift into at will—by observing and killing Mongol generals. Stances are meant to deal with different types of enemies: The stone stance, for instance, is better suited to taking down swordsmen, whereas the water stance’s flow of bludgeoning strikes is perfect for decimating shields. These stances, much like the rest of Jin’s repertoire, can be improved with skill points earned from defeating enemies and completing missions to unlock more combo strings and increase damage.The “ghost” in Ghost of Tsushima refers to Jin’s transformation from a rigid samurai warrior into a guerrilla vigilante willing to do anything to save his home. Where a samurai might focus entirely on his katana and bow, the covert tactics Jin learns over the course of the campaign give him access to a multitude of more subtle weaponry. This starts out with some basic kunai, which can be thrown to break an opponent’s guard from a distance, but quickly expands to include tools like smoke bombs, explosives, and even wind chimes that draw enemies’ attention. Jin’s most important tool, however, is his tanto, a short blade that allows him to perform quick, violent assassinations from the shadows. It’s rare to enter a fight where you’re not vastly outnumbered, so it’s best to balance the scales as much as possible from the relative comfort of stealth. The only time where stealth really feels required is when the Mongols have taken hostages. If an enemy spots you, they’ll start to cut down prisoners unless you can stop them.These two aspects of Jin’s arsenal combine to make every battle in Ghost of Tsushima fluid, evolving affairs. While you might initially sneak into a Mongol encampment, one wrong move can turn the mission into an all-out brawl against the camp’s entire garrison. I usually found myself picking off high-priority targets like bruisers with medieval shotguns and explosive-throwing support troops with my bow before wading into battle, where smart usage of my stances were key to surviving. Eventually, the Mongols begin to employ the services of animals like hunting dogs and hawks, which can sniff you out or spot you from above. I never found myself tiring of the basic flow of combat, but I quickly got so strong that stealthy approaches were just a waste of time when there weren’t any hostages to protect. Why assassinate Mongols when I could just walk up, challenge them to a duel, and mop up the stragglers?Besides combat, much of the game is dedicated to exploring the island’s lush environments. Jin strides across vast fields of flowers, the muck and mire of swamplands, and even the icy northern reaches of Tsushima during his adventure. At one point, he dropped his hand to feel the foliage as I raced along on a horse, mimicking my exact desire in that moment. Tsushima also features a weather system that, while not offering much apart from rain storms and rolling fog, gives the beautiful scenery an additional coat of aesthetic flair. Over the course of the game, Jin can learn songs on his flute that change the weather at will, which doesn’t really mean anything mechanically but makes for a fun way to customize your experience.Ghost of Tsushima has an almost insatiable desire to remind you of its influences through its visuals. Each mission opens with a title card that draws inspiration from old samurai films. An optional black-and-white visual filter is literally named after legendary director Akira Kurosawa but imparts the game with none of the charm or humanity for which his films are known. Important duels are preceded by a lengthy, tension-building cutscene that ultimately functioned as a minute or so to check my phone while waiting for it to play out for the tenth time. Every attempt at infusing Tsushima with these cribbed details feels like a wink and a nudge for recognition rather than true homage.Ghost of Tsushima fills its expanses with multiple diversions. Tall, white flags indicate the presence of a bamboo strike mini-game, which asks you to quickly tap out increasingly difficult button sequences to increase Jin’s resolve meter. In combat, this meter allows you to heal, use special techniques like a series of devastating slashes that homes in on opponents, and even revive yourself. Hot springs can be found beneath trees with orange blossoms, giving Jin a chance to decompress and extending his health bar. Swarms of fireflies mean a fox den is nearby, the denizen of which will lead you to a special shrine that lets you carry more charms, accessories with bonuses that range from simple stat boosts to more interesting mechanics like regaining arrows on a headshot. While it’s fun to listen to Jin’s internal thoughts while at the hot spring and to pet the foxes after their guidance, I never found myself excited to see one of these landmarks on the horizon. They were merely there to complete for a reward, a far cry from the dynamic intensity of battle.""Press R2 to compose haiku.""Open-world samurai simulatorFluid combat, gorgeous landscapes, charming side charactersTedious missions, uninspired protagonistSucker Punch ProductionsPlayStation 4July 17, 202055+ hours to finish the story and 100% the mapMost of Ghost of Tsushima’s activities exist simply to reward you rather than offer any meaningful experience. The layer of Japanese aesthetics barely hides the fact that the world is just there to be mindlessly mined for resources. It feels very weird to save a peasant from a group of Mongol soldiers, only to have them turn around and reward Jin with whatever meager possessions they were able to hide away. The game also has no problem with allowing you to raid homesteads for materials like iron and leather, which can then be used to upgrade your gear. Jin is the head of his clan, an aristocratic warrior who never wanted for anything in his life. Why is he so eager to squeeze every last resource from the people he’s supposed to be protecting? Life was hard before the Mongols arrived, and now villages and farms are burning. Those supplies would be much more useful in attending to refugees rather than a man whose sole ambition is reinstating the power structure that enforced these hardships in the first place.Jin isn’t sympathetic or interesting enough to care about. Any growth he shows over the course of the game deals entirely with his approach to warfare, rather than the imbalances within the society he seeks to protect or even his own responsibility for maintaining them. When a friend from his childhood betrays him, for instance, Jin does very little personal inventory about how he might have contributed to the turncoat’s view of the world, instead focusing on a quest for revenge that could have been entirely prevented with a little bit of compassion.The story’s saving grace involves the multi-part side missions that focus on Jin’s allies. Many of these missions follow a similar pattern that usually ends with just another battle, but the characters Jin recruits are so compelling and charming that it makes up for any predictable gameplay decisions. In one mission, Jin finds himself assisting an aging warrior named Lady Masako in finding the people who conspired to murder her entire family amidst the Mongol invasion. Her quest for revenge forces Jin to come to grips with his own anger, and at one point they even come to blows when he stops her from carrying out an arguably more justified form of the revenge he himself seeks against Khotun Khan. Another side mission sees Jin meeting an old archery mentor, Sensei Ishikawa, to help him find his star pupil. Ishikawa’s relationship with his student mirrors Jin’s own relationship with his uncle, giving Jin an outside perspective on his struggle between the honor taught to him by his family and what must be done to defeat the invaders.Despite (or perhaps because of) Ghost of Tsushima’s reliance on combat to drive many of its set pieces, the game’s best mission requires almost no combat. At various points in the game, Jin learns of local legends that lead to great rewards, like a robe that improves your archery skills or the ability to light your katana on fire. The latter requires climbing a massive mountain, atop which supposedly sits a meteor with the ability to imbue blades with flames. While this would be dangerous in and of itself, a snowstorm threatens to freeze Jin before he makes it to the summit. The mission, then, revolves around navigating treacherous mountain paths while making sure to find sporadic campfires before Jin succumbs to the cold. The climbing mechanics are so barebones that they barely warrant a mention elsewhere, but in the swirling vortex of the blizzard, learning how to spot footholds and places to attach Jin’s grappling hook become vital. I won’t ruin what you find at the top, but the journey was enough to make the quest for a burning blade one of my favorite parts of Tsushima. I just wish the game offered more of these moments.Ghost of Tsushima is pretty as heck—sporadic capturing left me with almost 50 GB worth of screenshots and short video clips to sift through—but at its core, it’s just another open-world game. I found myself audibly sighing every time I crested a hill towards a mystery objective only to find another fox to follow or another haiku to compose. These diversions, while unique at first glance, proved to just be busy work as time wore on. I was so strong by the end of the game—filling up every skill tree is easy if you ignore the main story and just explore for a bit—that I didn’t even bother using stealth tactics for the last third. I don’t think I even died after the first few hours. There’s so little to get excited about in Tsushima once the initial wonder of the wind physics and lush environments wears off that the only thing that kept me going was my own innate desire to fill out the entire map. And that can only hold someone’s interest for so long."
USgamer,"Your land has been invaded by the Mongols and there’s only one way to reclaim it: war crimes. Ghost of Tsushima puts you in the role of Jin Sakai, one of the last surviving samurai on Tsushima Island following the invasion of the Mongol army. It’s a story about embedded belief systems and the willingness to bend that code to fight back against an overwhelming enemy. It opens with a beach invasion where the samurai are summarily cut down by the invaders. You meet our antagonist, Khotun Khan - grandson of Ghengis, completely made up for this game - who is challenged to a duel by one of Tsushima’s strongest warriors. As he stands ready to fight, Khotun shows the Japanese warriors that he doesn’t play by their rules in a horrific showcase of barbarism. This sets the tone for the rest of the game as you attempt to push the Mongols back by facing them on their level, becoming the Ghost. 

This shift from samurai to Ghost begins almost immediately. And while the game has some smart ways to portray this transformation - like how your increased cruelty is reflected in the behaviour of your horse - it’s too brisk to feel impactful. One minute you’re calling people out for honourable duels and the next you’re stabbing them as they sleep. Ghost of Tsushima attempts to moralise over this shift, but there’s no escaping your fate. As a player, the only thing going through your mind will be how to take out the enemy as efficiently as possible. A samurai is trained from a young age to keep their emotions in check, which is fitting because Ghost of Tsushima barely made me feel anything at all. It doesn’t help that the story is so sparse, bogged down by busywork.  You clear its three regions like you’re ticking off a to-do list. You compose haikus to get new bandanas that don’t have an impact outside of looking a little different. You follow foxes to shrines - 49 of them - to upgrade your charms, which slightly tweak your ability to take and deal damage. You chop bamboo by following button prompts. You take hot spring baths to increase your health. Sometimes you find a new hat or a sheath for your sword. There are Assassin’s Creed-style climbing puzzles. Main missions fare a little better, though these are plagued with archaic design issues too. Insta-fail stealth missions? Yep. Tail a man at a certain distance? You bet. A bit where you’re stripped of all your gear and you have to use the barebones stealth? Of course. Red barrels you can ignite with arrows? Damn straight. Missions where you can walk slightly out of bounds and trigger a game over? Yeppers. Outside of that, you’re either clearing out Mongol compounds or having a one-on-one duel with a boss. The thing that carries Ghost of Tsushima is its world and the way you move around it. Instead of a minimap, you swipe up on the controller’s touchpad, triggering a gust of wind that leads you to your next objective. Pampas grass, trees, the string on your bandana - everything is in motion when the wind blows. It’s gorgeous. It keeps your eyes fixed on this stunning world when you’re exploring, rather than a map in the corner of the screen. Fog hangs on distant mountains, golden light breaks through a canopy of brightly coloured trees as leaves rain down, murmurations of birds dancing overhead. In the night, fireflies  bathe graveyards in a peaceful glow. Gnarled black forests, golden woodlands, poppy fields, frozen tundras, impossibly large fields - this is a world that begs you to dive into it. It’s just a shame there’s barely anything worth exploring it for. The wind might guide you, but you’re still setting waypoints on a map and clearing up icons that represent tedious, repetitive content. If you visit all the baths, your reward is the option to run around fighting the Mongols while wearing nothing but a towel. The grind isn’t worth the effort, and you’ll likely have the story finished before you unlock these daft extras anyway.Then there’s the believability of that world, which breaks when Jin phases through thin bamboo trees. Ghost of Tsushima, indeed. Sometimes you stealthily kill a man and he falls in a canned animation, poking out over a ledge onto some invisible death bed - bodies don’t have physics upon death. If you creep up behind a man who’s crouched, he will politely stand up so you can stab him in the neck and play the animation out. That stealth is old school as well. You can hide in long grass or behind cover, but there’s not really a cover system - Jin doesn’t interact with walls. You can’t even kill over cover or around corners - you have to get right next to an enemy unless you’re jumping down from above. Even if you’re hanging below an enemy, you can’t pull them over the edge for a kill - Jin instead jumps up and slashes at them. Later on you unlock the ability to chain up to three stealth kills together, and you can also assassinate people through screen doors, but those are the only calculations you’re making as you clear out compounds: how can I get these three enemies together for a chain kill? Will that guy pass under that wire so I can jump down from above? Will anyone see? Of course, you can engage at range too. There’s a short bow for enemies with no armour and a heavy bow for those with helmets. There’s a satisfying feeling of heft to the shots. But again, you’re usually just using it to thin the edges of a camp so you can clear out the middle without archers on watchtowers spotting you from their overwatch position. Actual combat fares a little better. It’s simple, but effective. Swords feel deadly and action is instant - important for an action game. You can interrupt swings to pull your sword up for a parry. It’s no button masher. You switch between four different stances to combat different enemy types, and there’s a mid-game ability that makes you feel unstoppable, accompanied by a cool visual trick. I won’t spoil it here, but that’s when limbs and heads start flying. I also have to give a shout to the way you can manually sheath your sword with a little swipe of the touchpad, drawing your finger across as Jin flicks the blood from its edge or wipes it across his sleeve. It’s almost ritualistic. The one-on-one duels are Ghost of Tsushima at its best. Here it forgets about those four stances being used for enemy archetypes and you’re free to switch between them all, stringing your own combos together to bring down a dangerous enemy. It also helps that these automatically lock you on to your foe, whereas fights against groups have no lock on at all, sometimes leaving you swinging your sword into the air like you’re the one who’s scared of ghosts. As you lean into your Japanese Batman persona, the Mongols become more and more terrified of you. Sometimes you’ll kill one of their allies and their friends will stumble backwards, crawling away, opening them up for a sword through the belly. Sometimes they’ll down tools and leg it. Walking up to an archer, sword raised above your head, sidestepping and deflecting incoming arrows - it’s in these action sequences where Ghost of Tsushima excels. It has its moments, but like Jin Sakai in the opening hours, the past holds it back. It’s Open World: The Video Game. It’s far too easy, too - the lack of consequence for failure makes it feel like you’re just going through the motions. If you’ll excuse the wind-based pun, it’s a breeze. While playing it, I often found my mind wandering. By the third and final act, I just wanted it to be over. Like the samurai, Ghost of Tsushima feels like a relic of a bygone era.

If you thought Sucker Punch Productions’ move from creating Sly Cooper to making Infamous was brave, just wait until you play GHOST OF TSUSHIMA. Progressing from Second Son’s modern Seattle setting with its obnoxious, rebellious protagonist to Ghost of Tsushima’s ancient Japanese backdrop and its honor-driven main character, was a very bold direction to go in. It could have spelled disaster for this Sony developer, breaking the combo of so many fantastic first-party PlayStation exclusives.Fortunately, Ghost of Tsushima suffers no such fate, fitting together multiple polished elements that make for a journey worth experiencing. This is the Game Revolution review.Controlling Jin Sakai, a Samurai warrior, the player has the primary task of driving away Mongol invaders. This hostile force uses tactics that Jin and his Samurai brethren haven’t seen before and are unable to defend against. It’s soon made clear that the Samurai’s tradition of maintaining one’s honor and respecting the enemy in battle is not going to save Tsushima, which causes Jin to venture down a different path.While I expected to be told the story of a legendary warrior who goes around beating everything before ultimately coming out on top, I wasn’t expecting the additional conflict of honor versus dishonor to be so powerful. It’s done really well and makes for some emotional moments that hit surprisingly hard.There aren’t many twists or turns in the plot, which in a way plays into the game’s favor, as there is a sense of inevitability in Jin’s actions and what they will ultimately cost him.I spent 30 hours with Ghost of Tsushima before writing this review. It took me 25 hours to beat the main campaign with a few key side missions, which are surprisingly great and provide a good chunk of backstory and lore, before finishing off my playthrough with five hours of exploring and making use of the feature-rich Photo Mode.The island of Tsushima is presented beautifully. It is honestly breathtaking at times, with a vibrancy and high contrast that truly makes you feel part of an ancient Japanese legend. The weather effects add to the drama, with thunder and lightning being the biggest highlight as it crashes down. Environments are varied, but regardless of whether it’s sunny or snowy, it’s always a treat for the eyes and the PS4’s Share Button.This is especially the case when playing on PS4 Pro, which enjoys “Better Frame-Rate” and “Higher Resolution” modes. While I’m partial to smoother gameplay, I found myself settling on the Higher Resolution option. Despite being locked to 30 FPS, the stutter-free gameplay made it easy to enjoy alongside the boosted resolution.In addition to the Share Button, Sucker Punch has once again made great use of the DualShock 4’s Touchpad. The developer has basically mapped four additional prompts to the touchpad which activate by swiping in a specific direction. To call upon the wind for guidance, for example, you simply swipe up. It’s a small thing, but it’s appreciated.Sucker Punch has also done an amazing job of limiting distractions in Ghost of Tsushima‘s open world. HUD elements are unobtrusive, with a minimalistic approach that provides essential information without pulling you out of the experience. The highlight here is the wind, which guides you to the next objective. There’s no waypoint, you just follow the breeze.While it can sometimes be tricky to know when to maneuver around hills or water, the wind mechanic usually works well to keep you moving in the correct direction, while still being able to look around and appreciate the rich visuals, rather than being locked in and focused on a quest marker.The optional Japanese voice acting further adds to the immersion, which I urge every player to try (with English subtitles). It’s absolutely the recommended way to play, further immersing you into the world. Couple this with the epic soundtrack which really shines during the larger battles and you really do feel like part of the action.While Sucker Punch has made an effort to remove distractions, there are some animation hiccups that can be jarring. NPCs can randomly fall over and continue to fall over until they eventually stumble into the correct spot. This happened only a handful of times during my playthrough, but it’s there. Enemy AI can also pull off some funky animations in narrower areas, but again the issue is rare.Ghost of Tsushima allows you to approach most missions in two different ways. There’s the honorable path of heading straight for your enemy and fighting them in a fair duel, and then there’s the not-so-honorable path of carrying out assassinations from the shadows.There’s no morality meter or anything like that, which I think is a good thing. Instead of a video game mechanic forcing you to choose a “best path,” you can instead focus on what you enjoy most and leveling up abilities that complement that playstyle.While your character won’t grow horns or have his sword swapped out for a red lightsaber when you commit too many dishonorable acts, you’re still made to feel guilty about using poison and other shady tactics through the dialogue and the overarching themes explored in the story.Sometimes it can seem impossible to win fights through standard combat, especially on Hard, forcing a more stealthy approach. It’s interesting to have the player consciously make the choice to give up a difficult, yet honorable, win just get the mission done by any means necessary.Mission structure is quite basic, as you wipe out group of enemies after group of enemies, sometimes backed up by friendlies. Thankfully, what would be repetitive gameplay is made more exciting through the combat system and the rate at which you unlock new abilities.Jin has four different stances to master, each of which is tailored to countering a specific type of enemy. With groups being made up of many different enemy types, the player has to be constantly switching between stances in a kind of frenetic game of rock, paper, scissors. It works really well, giving Jin the ability to cut through multiple tough opponents with well-timed counters, all the while keeping an eye out for incoming long-range attacks. It ends up looking like a sort of dance, which is super satisfying to pull off without any flaws.Maintain that flawless assault and you’ll earn the Ghost Stance. Once unlocked through the story, this allows you to immediately one-hit-kill three enemies with a stylish flash of red. It’s as wonderful as it sounds and can turn the tide in particularly tricky encounters.Resolve acts as “MP” which is spent on healing and abilities. These abilities come in useful when trying to handle a group of enemies or a single tough opponent. Deciding how and when to spend that Resolve can often mean the difference between winning and losing fights.What initially seems like simple combat actually has a surprising layer of complexity that the player is gradually introduced to. As you level up and spend Technique Points on new moves and tools, you become better equipped at handling multiple foes. You also improve your stealth with a grappling hook that allows you to quickly ascend above the enemy. You can then scout and form a plan. Both playstyles evolve over time, which keeps the gameplay feeling fresh.What’s more, you don’t need to worry about being the “right level” for a new area, with no forced grinding or anything tedious like that. You can choose to follow golden birds that helpfully lead you to health boosts, minor missions, and other goodies, but you can also easily ignore them. If you just want to roll through the main story, you can absolutely just go for it.Oh, and you can collect items while riding on horseback, which further cuts away any animation padding and keeps you moving!After you’ve spent a good 20+ hours finishing the main story, there will still be plenty of side content to check out. The Mythic Tales are the highlights here, allowing you to learn powerful abilities and earn awesome armor rewards. Then there are the missions tied to key characters, which award you with valuable resources and earn you more Technique Points to spend on new moves and equipment. Finally, there are the more repetitive missions, which have you killing bad guys to save homes and villages, as you slowly work to wipe out the Mongol forces from the island.There is a lot to do here and I think Ghost of Tsushima earns its $60 through the main story alone. However, for those who need a serious hour count to justify the purchase, there are plenty of enemy camps to wipe out and collectibles to find that will easily push you to 50+ hours and beyond.Ghost of Tsushima is a worthy addition to the roster of must-play PS4 exclusives that have kept players loyal to the console. Though I play primarily on PC, I’m always eager to boot up my PS4 Pro for the latest exclusive to witness astonishing visuals, satisfying gameplay, and a compelling story that is only available on the Sony system. It’s games like this that sell the hardware.Shifting the focus to ancient history was always going to be a challenge, especially with competition from the likes of Assassin’s Creed and its epic scale, but I think Sucker Punch has delivered a more refined, focused experience that offers enough content without the risk of overwhelming its audience. And as there are no microtransactions infesting its mechanics and influencing its balance, Ghost of Tsushima is honorable in its approach and deserves to be played.Ghost of Tsushima was reviewed on PS4 Pro with code provided by the publisher.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Destructoid,"darkI’m just going to come out and say it: Sucker Punch is underrated as hell.I know. Infamous got a lot of love back in the day, but as far as the sequels (and the standalone games) are concerned, not enough love. Also, Sly Cooper remains one of the greatest mascot treasures in all of gaming, and you can’t convince me otherwise.But if all of those didn’t manage to put Sucker Punch in the same conversation as a lot of other studios, Ghost of Tsushima will be the tipping point.Ghost of Tsushima (PS4 [reviewed with a PS4 Pro])Developer: Sucker PunchPublisher: SonyReleased: July 17, 2020MSRP: $59.99Ghost of Tsushima wowed me from its opening moments. I can’t stress enough: this is one of the most incredible-looking games I’ve ever seen, and not just from a technical standpoint. Ghost is somehow moody, yet idyllic. Bloody and dangerous, yet calm and serene.Waking up on the battlefield of Tsushima to find his people massacred at the hands of an invading Mongol army, samurai (and noble) Jin Sakai is foisted into a good old fashioned revenge tale. While it seems like a surface-level conflict, the setup is frankly genius, allowing the narrative to blossom alongside of the player. Jin morphs into the persona of the “Ghost,” the potential savior of Japan, but his lineage provides us with a firm background that informs his character’s motivations.Watching it all unfold with Japanese audio (English is available) and in an optional black and white “Kurosawa mode” filter is glorious. Sucker Punch pays homage to classic Japanese cinema throughout the game’s 30-ish-hour runtime.That filter — and the rest of the game really — sings in HDR, right down to details like individual leaves cascading across the screen. Amazingly, Sucker Punch also kept the load times down to a minimum, as they range from five to ten seconds (sometimes less) when transitioning between fast-travel locations. PS4 Pro owners have the option to swap between a performance-based mode and a visual-first toggle, but I kept it on the latter the entire time and didn’t notice any major framerate drops. In many ways, coupled with the fast load times, it feels like the culmination of current generation tech.While this is a “call your horse with a button and roam the open world” game, Ghost of Tsushima allows its personality to augment that seemingly rote framework. It starts out a bit clunky, with a limited moveset and light traversal options, but once you get into the main loop, everything comes together.You know that boring breadcrumb trail that’s in most games? Well Ghost reinvents it, with a flowing wind effect that points you in the right direction while wildly altering the environment in front of your eyes. I’ll never get tired of it and now I want it in pretty much every game: it’s tough going back to busy objective markers that gum up the HUD.The rhythm of combat is also a sight to behold. Resolve (think of it as MP) fuels your healing and your skills, allowing an interesting balance between defense and offense. The crux of the action is housed within the timing-based parry system, as well as the need to dodge unblockable attacks (reflected by a blue and red glint, respectively). It’s the standard for a lot of action romps, but I respect it, especially after it opens up.Ghost of Tsushima slowly ramps as you acquire new stances, dancing between them to counter enemies who sport shields, spears, and swords. You also manage to feel powerful at the start even with a low health bar and no tricks, as the parry system provides you with most of the tools you need to survive. Adding in extra ninja stuff, more stealth options, dodging, and brute-force techniques help you customize Jin’s playstyle to your liking, though.Like the small open-world nuances, combat blossoms over time. The insta-kill standoff sequences are fitting given the cinematic samurai theme, but are also functional ways to approach combat head-on if you aren’t big on the whole stealth thing (very few missions require a “no alarm” stealth parameter).Outside of fighting, you’ll also find open-world locations that grant bonuses that require you to compose a haiku first. Or reflect on certain story beats while bathing in hot springs. It’s all very unique and helps break the chains of most open-world checklist garbage. Sucker Punch embraces this philosophy inside and out, as the HUD follows a minimalist design by default. Ghost of Tsushima kept me interested throughout the course of its entire campaign, but there are plenty of story-based side missions and extras to uncover. The map isn’t obnoxiously big — though there are a lot of collectibles — and the genuinely speedy fast-travel system helps move things along. The dual audio and multiple difficulty settings also nicely tee up extra replays.With Ghost of Tsushima under its belt, Sucker Punch deserves to be in the same conversation as Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Sony Santa Monica. If this generation is to wrap up soon, it’s fitting that it’ll end with Tsushima: one of its most beautiful games thus far. [This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Forbes,"Ghost of TsushimaWe are only a few months away from the launch of the PlayStation 5, and yet here we are, with Sony releasing all-time great exclusives in the final months of the PS4’s life cycle.The Last of Us Part 2, despite many agreeing that it’s a phenomenal game, has been a hotbed of debate since its release. Ghost of Tsushima? It has been a far, far less controversial title, liked by critics, but flat-out beloved by fans. And it’s easy to see why, as it’s a game that is genuinely impossible not to like with how much it gets right.Sucker Punch is best known for its Infamous games, a solid series of superhero outings for PlayStation, albeit no one was usually listing them among Sony’s best in a given generation. But once again, Sony has allowed a developer to spread its wings and do something wildly outside their usual box, and we have gone from a superhero cityscape to a samurai open world, and Sucker Punch has absolutely nailed every aspect of the landing here.The game follows Jin, the nephew of the samurai lord of Tsushima, who finds his home island invaded and decimated by a Mongol horde. His uncle captured, his armor broken and his spirit crushed, Jin must crawl his way back to assembling a fighting force to retake the island, relying on the few warriors that survived the massacre, along with turning himself into a mythical legend that inspires the people of Tsushima and strikes fear into the hearts of the Mongols, “the Ghost.”Ghost of TsushimaIt is impossible to talk about Ghost of Tsushima without first mentioning its beauty. I have made the case that Ghost of Tsushima may be the most beautiful game ever made, and given the past generation of releases, that is not something I say lightly. It’s not just about photorealism. In fact, environments and characters in games like God of War or The Last of Us are certainly more graphically intensive. But it’s the art design here, the gorgeous, sweeping landscapes of rich, vibrant colors, and the use of sunlight, wind and weather effects to make practically every frame of the game something you want to snap a photo of. And the game lets you do just that, with one of the best-in-business photo modes, which is how you’re seeing the gorgeous snaps threaded all throughout this piece. Rarely have I found a game where I just constantly stand there in awe of a given landscape, and Tsushima elicits this feeling roughly once every ten minutes, depending on where your mission takes you.The beauty extends past the world, however, and into the combat.I am in awe of how enjoyable Sucker Punch has made combat in Ghost of Tsushima, a fine balance between the ultra-hard parrying and dodging of a Nioh or Dark Souls, but challenging enough to be more than a simple hack and slash. A wide variety of armor sets and charms, paired with traditional parrying and dodging, paired with special ghost weapons, paired with shifting combat stances and special moves, all equals one of the most robust, engaging combat systems I’ve ever seen.Ghost of TsushimaEverything about combat feels excellent. From the first time you win a standoff with a one hit kill, to when you’ve perfected your stagger build that allows you to win 1 v 6s in open combat with ease. If there is one criticism you can make of Ghost of Tsushima it’s that it is rather long and can get repetitive. And yet the thing is, combat is so good that you don’t really care if the 85th side mission you’re doing is to go to a farm and kill 12 Ronin because combat is just that damn fun. I am constantly reminded of how Insomniac mastered Spider-Man combat in that game, making you feel more like that hero than ever before. Sucker Punch has done the same here, but with a samurai. This is exactly how I wanted my overpowered, hyper-skilled samurai to feel, a whirlwind of death and destruction, rather than someone constantly trying to avoid getting one shot in more difficult games. As such, Ghost of Tsushima can feel a bit easy compared to rivals, but the power fantasy is worth the trade, if you ask me.Finally, a third pillar of the game is one I was not expecting, an incredibly well-written, emotionally impactful story. Jin’s journey is fascinating, as we are not going down the well-worn road of “should heroes kill?” here, but rather the story is one about honor, and a constant conflict between Jin and his uncle over the tactics they should be using to fight the Mongols. His uncle seems to believe that facing your enemy head on is the honorable move, even if you lose the island and its people are slaughtered. Jin discovers he’s willing to make compromises if it means saving lives, sacrificing his good name by stabbing enemies in the back or poisoning their armies if need be.But it’s not just Jin’s story that’s gripping. We have a number of lengthy side quests that are fascinating, mostly based around Jin and his allies. The most harrowing I saw (mild spoilers) is a warrior monk who begins his journey saying he never wants to swing his weapon in hate. And by the time his story ends, he’s burning Mongols alive and we are left to wonder what our murderous influence has done to the man.Ghost of TsushimaEven the minor stories are memorable. I found one side mission where a group of townsfolk were acting very weird, and said they didn’t want my protection. I eventually discovered they had traded all their women away to the Mongols in exchange for the safety of the cowering men. I rescued the women, who decided to leave the village and live on their own, and executed the town leader as an example to the others. The entire mission was me probably only killing like, eight bad guys, and yet it hit me hard. There are at least a dozen other missions I could say produced similar reactions, including many that nearly moved me to tears that I won’t get into, lest you not be able to experience them fresh for yourself.As I said earlier, I do think Ghost of Tsushima goes on a bit too long. The third section of the map especially feels like overkill, and it’s so barren you do have to wonder if it was sort of an afterthought, and I’m not sure it needed to exist at all, as it makes the game kind of feel like it runs out of steam by the end (though the conclusions of various storylines that occur there are all good). I just would have shaved a little bit off the top of this game, similar to what I said about The Last of Us. I really just think many 30 hour games need to be more like 20-25, as it’s like watching a TV show you love, yet you get exhausted by it when you realize it has say, a 35 episode season.That said, I’ll be damned if I don’t want to return to that world down the road, perhaps in DLC (a bit unlikely in this era) or almost certainly in a sequel, given the success of the game. From the trailers, we always knew Ghost of Tsushima would be pretty. But I was not expecting a combat system this engaging and fun, or a story this gripping and emotional. It is easily one of the best games of the entire PS4 generation, and given its competition, that’s saying something.Score: 9.5/10Follow me on Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. Pick up my sci-fi novels Herokiller and Herokiller 2, and read my first series, The Earthborn Trilogy, which is also on audiobook."
Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowSucker Punch's latest game is hoping to be a tour de force of cinematic-inspired samurai action. Does Ghost of Tsushima live up to its expectations? Our review.What is the value of honor? Is living one’s life by a rigid and unbending set of rules, even when that means great sacrifice, truly worth it? What happens when one chooses to abandon tradition and set forth on a new, never before treaded path even if that means losing the honor they once coveted? These are just a few of the questions that Jin Sakai, the protagonist in Sucker Punch’s latest masterpiece, Ghost of Tsushima, must learn for himself as he embarks on an incredible and unexpected journey.Ghost of Tsushima opens with Jin and his fellow samurai defending the shores of their homeland against an invading Mongul horde. Things do not go as planned though and the brave warriors who guard Tsushima are all but destroyed. Jin himself only survives thanks to the efforts of a woman named Yuna who appears to be a thief of some sorts. The two form an unlikely alliance and set off to recruit allies in their quest to liberate Tsushima from the clutches of the malevolent Khotun Khan and his army. In order to liberate his people, Jin will have to make a lot of sacrifices and possibly bring his honor into question.I don’t want to spoil too much of the story because it’s such a delectable, savory meal. Every quest has a story behind it that adds to the game’s mythos. Every decision has a consequence and it all weaves into a wonderful tapestry that makes Tsushima feel like a living, breathing world. The friends and allies you make along the way have their own stories to tell and they’re just as compelling as the main plot. I have to admit, a few quests hit close to home with their themes and really worked to connect me emotionally to the game, which is an extremely rare occurrence for me personally.Wandering through the massive world of Ghost of Tsushima is a cavalcade of diversions. Much like Breath of the Wild it’s easy to get distracted from the task at hand by something that catches the corner of your eye and suddenly half an hour has gone by and you don’t remember what you were doing in the first place. Beyond the stories told in the main and side-quests there are an incredible amount of things to keep you from whatever you were doing in the first place.The island of Tsushima is littered head to toe with exploratory distractions. Maybe a fox will pop up and lead you to a shrine, or maybe you’ll have to do some platform puzzling to pray to another shrine, and there’s always a chance you’ll find a bamboo strike to help increase your resolve. Perhaps you’ll stumble upon an area perfect for a moment of meditative haiku writing. No matter what you end up doing, your character will benefit by gaining things like charms that buff your sword, cosmetic skins, or permanent stat increases of some sort. It’s pretty easy to lose track of time while wandering in Ghost of Tsushima because the island is ridiculously gorgeous. Fields full of vibrantly-colored cherry blossoms litter the island and its shores are breathtaking. Even though most of the island is covered in wilderness there’s a ton of variety to every area you end up visiting along your journey. Beyond nature’s beauty, every village, temple, and castle you visit along the way has its own wonders to behold as well.It would be hard to look at a game like this and not make comparisons to the work of acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa and several of his films like The Seven Samurai and Yojimbo as well as his period pieces like Rashomon. Sucker Punch must’ve seen this coming a mile away and decided to include a “Kurosawa Mode” as a visual option. They even went as far as to consult with the director’s estate on it. The results are incredibly accurate to the sharp depth and tone that are prevalent in Kurosawa’s black and white films. It’s a fun addition and can be enjoyable if you’re looking to take cinematic in-game pics or pretend you’re a wandering samurai in one of his films, especially if you put on Japanese audio and English subtitles. However, it can be a hindrance as far as doing things like picking up wildflowers or other items from the environment. There are also a few missions where color is an extremely helpful tool. Still, it’s a nice bonus.Character designs are also totally on point and both the English and Japanese voice actors behind the various roles do a fantastic job with their performances. Like I said earlier, this game has some great emotional gravitas to it, and that wouldn’t come across even half as much without such great deliveries and wonderfully animated characters.While samurai are bound to a rigid code of honor that does not allow them to do things like stab an enemy in the back, desperate times call for desperate measures. Jin will find himself in several situations where something more akin to an Assassin’s Creed approach is more appropriate. Throughout the game, players will have to use stealth to infiltrate enemy strongholds or kill without being seen. The game gives players an ability similar to AC's eagle vision that lets them track enemies while trying to remain undetected. Players will also get an arsenal of tools to help them such as kunai daggers, smoke bombs, and bells that you can use to distract enemies.Most of the time though, players will also have the option to meet the enemy head-on in combat. There’s usually even an option to challenge your opponents to a face-off duel before diving into a full-on brawl with their allies. Along the way players will be able to unlock new dodging techniques and various sword-fighting stances. The stances end up being a big part of sword-fighting since each of the four main enemy classes (swordsman, spearmen, shieldmen, and brutes) are weak to a certain one. There are also some fantastic one-on-one samurai duels that will put your skills to the test, they’re a real treat and probably one of the most immersive samurai experiences in the game.As you progress you’ll also earn charms to augment your katana with things like buffs to damage or defense, stealth skills, and bow and arrow skills to name a few. Armor and weapons are also upgradable through various merchants, but players will have to collect a lot of supplies such as bamboo, iron, leather, fabrics, flowers, and more in order to afford them. One of the more important tools in combat is the Resolve meter that takes the form of a group circles above the health gauge. Resolve can be used to heal Jin during a fight or pull off some extra-special attacks that are learned as the game progresses. Knowing when to be conservative and when to cut loose with resolve can be key to winning a battle. Players will really have to make use of every resource at their disposal to truly master Ghost of Tsushima’s combat mechanics and be victorious.Overall, the way that the stealth and combat mix together reminded me a lot of the Batman Arkham series in the way that it flows, which isn’t a bad thing at all. However, the combat is far from perfect because of two major flaws. First and foremost, the game suffers from a lack of a true lock-on system. There were far too many times I would be fighting one enemy and another would come up and my focus would shift, or maybe I would be trying to hone in on a particular enemy and suddenly I’m lunging into someone else. And then there’s the camera, which far too often felt like it was another enemy on the field. I found myself constantly spinning the cam not only to focus on the action, but also to keep an eye out for enemies looking to get a cheap hit in.Fortunately though, it’s not tough to overcome these obstacles and really master the combat mechanics. It also helps that Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t really punish you for dying so you never really lose progress. Overall, it does a great job at balancing the challenge and accessible fun factors of what makes a game like this so enjoyable. The traversal mechanics are also extremely polished and actions like leaping from branches, jumping on rooftops, and climbing mountains are very intuitive with the exception of a few hiccups here and there.One thing I just adore about Ghost of Tsushima is the fact that I don’t have to get off my horse when I’m riding to pick up items. Sure, it’s a pet peeve of mine, but after having to hop on and off my horse so damn much in Red Dead Redemption 2, I’m more than happy to be able to grab supplies and plants without breaking my stride as I ride to my next destination. It’s a small thing, but it’s indicative of the attention to detail that Sucker Punch poured into this game.While Ghost of Tsushima has a few of the standard pop-ins and visual glitches that are common to most open-world games this is still one of the most beautiful and fluid titles I’ve ever played. While I did have a few moments of frustration, usually brought on by camera angle issues, they are almost completely forgivable when I look at the overall package. There’s just too much here to like and none of it feels tacked on or a time-filler. It’s wonderfully balanced and doesn’t punish you for needing to attempt something more than once. And, even with the camera working against me, I was able to become a masterful samurai. Perhaps Ghost of Tsushima isn’t a perfect cherry blossom, but it is pretty damn close as far as I’m concerned.This review is based on a PS4 download code provided by the publisher.

					Seems to be getting really good reviews. I hope Sony does some kind of backwards compatibility. I'd love to play this on a PS5. 				
					Yeah, I'd be surprised if there isn't already some kind of plan in place to bring this and other last-minute games of this generation to the PS5 in an easy / consumer-friendly way. With Microsoft touting its services and plans already, Sony would be absolutely nuts not to at least have started creating something (if they hadn't come up with it already).				
					Am I high or hasn't Sony said this game and almost every ps4 game will play fine on ps5 				
					They set a requirement that all games released after (I forget the date) have to run as-is on PS5.  Nothing about having to take advantage of PS5 features.  Just that it has to run w/o modification.

					You think PC well be coming next year?				
					I hope so. But I don't think any of Sucker Punch's previous games did. 				
					PC only seems to be exclusive to the decima engine games				
					Still, Sony published both games. I was pretty surprised to see H:ZD and DS on PC, so it wouldn't be too much farther a leap for this to make its way too, if Sony is down.				
					And more than published both games, owns Sucker Punch and Guerrilla.				
					Sounds great. I'll buy it 				
					It's nice to see them including a full Japanese language option with subtitles. Most western produced games set in a different location where another spoken language is standard are often English only, same goes for movies and television shows.   
					Although I've read that the Japanese dialogue isn't synced properly to the animations, that could be distracting but it's not uncommon. Plenty of Japanese developed games which offer both Japanese & English voice acting don't usually sync up the English properly.  Still kinda weird here considering the setting and vibe of this one, one would think the Japanese language should be the default for the lip syncing. 				
					Admittedly, it's not perfectly synced, but it wouldn't be in a movie either and it's not really distracting in any way. At least for me it wasn't.				
					That's something they could patch later.  Hopefully they will.

VG247,"Your land has been invaded by the Mongols and there’s only one way to reclaim it: war crimes. Ghost of Tsushima puts you in the role of Jin Sakai, one of the last surviving samurai on Tsushima Island following the invasion of the Mongol army. It’s a story about embedded belief systems and the willingness to bend that code to fight back against an overwhelming enemy. It opens with a beach invasion where the samurai are summarily cut down by the invaders. You meet our antagonist, Khotun Khan - grandson of Ghengis, completely made up for this game - who is challenged to a duel by one of Tsushima’s strongest warriors. As he stands ready to fight, Khotun shows the Japanese warriors that he doesn’t play by their rules in a horrific showcase of barbarism. This sets the tone for the rest of the game as you attempt to push the Mongols back by facing them on their level, becoming the Ghost. 

This shift from samurai to Ghost begins almost immediately. And while the game has some smart ways to portray this transformation - like how your increased cruelty is reflected in the behaviour of your horse - it’s too brisk to feel impactful. One minute you’re calling people out for honourable duels and the next you’re stabbing them as they sleep. Ghost of Tsushima attempts to moralise over this shift, but there’s no escaping your fate. As a player, the only thing going through your mind will be how to take out the enemy as efficiently as possible. A samurai is trained from a young age to keep their emotions in check, which is fitting because Ghost of Tsushima barely made me feel anything at all. It doesn’t help that the story is so sparse, bogged down by busywork.  You clear its three regions like you’re ticking off a to-do list. You compose haikus to get new bandanas that don’t have an impact outside of looking a little different. You follow foxes to shrines - 49 of them - to upgrade your charms, which slightly tweak your ability to take and deal damage. You chop bamboo by following button prompts. You take hot spring baths to increase your health. Sometimes you find a new hat or a sheath for your sword. There are Assassin’s Creed-style climbing puzzles. Main missions fare a little better, though these are plagued with archaic design issues too. Insta-fail stealth missions? Yep. Tail a man at a certain distance? You bet. A bit where you’re stripped of all your gear and you have to use the barebones stealth? Of course. Red barrels you can ignite with arrows? Damn straight. Missions where you can walk slightly out of bounds and trigger a game over? Yeppers. Outside of that, you’re either clearing out Mongol compounds or having a one-on-one duel with a boss. The thing that carries Ghost of Tsushima is its world and the way you move around it. Instead of a minimap, you swipe up on the controller’s touchpad, triggering a gust of wind that leads you to your next objective. Pampas grass, trees, the string on your bandana - everything is in motion when the wind blows. It’s gorgeous. It keeps your eyes fixed on this stunning world when you’re exploring, rather than a map in the corner of the screen. Fog hangs on distant mountains, golden light breaks through a canopy of brightly coloured trees as leaves rain down, murmurations of birds dancing overhead. In the night, fireflies  bathe graveyards in a peaceful glow. Gnarled black forests, golden woodlands, poppy fields, frozen tundras, impossibly large fields - this is a world that begs you to dive into it. It’s just a shame there’s barely anything worth exploring it for. The wind might guide you, but you’re still setting waypoints on a map and clearing up icons that represent tedious, repetitive content. If you visit all the baths, your reward is the option to run around fighting the Mongols while wearing nothing but a towel. The grind isn’t worth the effort, and you’ll likely have the story finished before you unlock these daft extras anyway.Then there’s the believability of that world, which breaks when Jin phases through thin bamboo trees. Ghost of Tsushima, indeed. Sometimes you stealthily kill a man and he falls in a canned animation, poking out over a ledge onto some invisible death bed - bodies don’t have physics upon death. If you creep up behind a man who’s crouched, he will politely stand up so you can stab him in the neck and play the animation out. That stealth is old school as well. You can hide in long grass or behind cover, but there’s not really a cover system - Jin doesn’t interact with walls. You can’t even kill over cover or around corners - you have to get right next to an enemy unless you’re jumping down from above. Even if you’re hanging below an enemy, you can’t pull them over the edge for a kill - Jin instead jumps up and slashes at them. Later on you unlock the ability to chain up to three stealth kills together, and you can also assassinate people through screen doors, but those are the only calculations you’re making as you clear out compounds: how can I get these three enemies together for a chain kill? Will that guy pass under that wire so I can jump down from above? Will anyone see? Of course, you can engage at range too. There’s a short bow for enemies with no armour and a heavy bow for those with helmets. There’s a satisfying feeling of heft to the shots. But again, you’re usually just using it to thin the edges of a camp so you can clear out the middle without archers on watchtowers spotting you from their overwatch position. Actual combat fares a little better. It’s simple, but effective. Swords feel deadly and action is instant - important for an action game. You can interrupt swings to pull your sword up for a parry. It’s no button masher. You switch between four different stances to combat different enemy types, and there’s a mid-game ability that makes you feel unstoppable, accompanied by a cool visual trick. I won’t spoil it here, but that’s when limbs and heads start flying. I also have to give a shout to the way you can manually sheath your sword with a little swipe of the touchpad, drawing your finger across as Jin flicks the blood from its edge or wipes it across his sleeve. It’s almost ritualistic. The one-on-one duels are Ghost of Tsushima at its best. Here it forgets about those four stances being used for enemy archetypes and you’re free to switch between them all, stringing your own combos together to bring down a dangerous enemy. It also helps that these automatically lock you on to your foe, whereas fights against groups have no lock on at all, sometimes leaving you swinging your sword into the air like you’re the one who’s scared of ghosts. As you lean into your Japanese Batman persona, the Mongols become more and more terrified of you. Sometimes you’ll kill one of their allies and their friends will stumble backwards, crawling away, opening them up for a sword through the belly. Sometimes they’ll down tools and leg it. Walking up to an archer, sword raised above your head, sidestepping and deflecting incoming arrows - it’s in these action sequences where Ghost of Tsushima excels. It has its moments, but like Jin Sakai in the opening hours, the past holds it back. It’s Open World: The Video Game. It’s far too easy, too - the lack of consequence for failure makes it feel like you’re just going through the motions. If you’ll excuse the wind-based pun, it’s a breeze. While playing it, I often found my mind wandering. By the third and final act, I just wanted it to be over. Like the samurai, Ghost of Tsushima feels like a relic of a bygone era.
