Dangerous supernatural powers are at risk of falling into their malevolent hands, and I’m meant to stop that catastrophe. There’s an overwhelming sense of urgency, but there I am, basically tying off sacks for peasants.It happened like this: early in The Witcher 3 I was tasked with finding a witch. The witch lived in a nearby waterside cottage and was reported to have details on the whereabouts of aforementioned daughter figure. I was determined to speak to her immediately. My cause was urgent, after all. I’m Geralt of Rivia, scorned Witcher, master swordsman, and I have no time for nonsense.On my way to the witch I stumbled upon a typically destitute Velen village. I didn’t care about the village at all, and I wasn’t drawn to its armories or tradesmen. But something—maybe the sun setting so amber on the horizon, or the children dashing frantically through the muddy streets—made me stop. I was curious.It probably goes without saying, but if you’re in a hurry, never get off your horse enroute in an open world RPG. This is especially true for The Witcher 3. Several hours later, once I’d cleared out some monsters for a desperate peasant in her far-off stable, and made preliminary moves to slay a beast haunting the town, I forced myself to leave. Turns out the witch was only 50 metres North all along.I didn’t really want to leave, though. It’s not that I liked the town, and it’s not that I savoured the fantasy of being a hero to its people. It’s certainly not because I wanted to tick off this town’s quests (there are so many quests, there’s no point being thorough). I was just curious about the villagers’ circumstances. I’d gotten to know the town, but I didn’t understand it. How did they get so poor and wretched? Am I complicit, thanks to my (reluctant) connection with the Nilfgaardians? Is it the climate? Or is it just the way they’ve always lived?Straight up, this is the most remarkable thing about The Witcher 3. Its writing isn’t perfect—it still bears some of the familiar trappings of being a video game—but it almost always rewards curiosity, big time. The rewards for wondering are invariably bleak, but The Witcher 3 achieves something very few video games do: when I’m engaged in a peripheral mini-narrative I’m not necessarily thinking about its game aspects. I’m not thinking about the XP rewarded, or the money I’ll get, or the allegiances I’ll forge, or the buffs I’ll unlock. I’m not grinding. I just really want to know, and understand, what’s going on.Geralt’s cause may seem urgent, but the worst way to play The Witcher 3 is quickly. In this game, distractions overwhelm you. For mine, the game’s distractions are where its most engaging stories are found.Geralt is the hero. He’s a gruff, powerful, chiselled, archetypal male video game protagonist. Early on, The Witcher 3 has him exploring the Northern Realms, recently taken over by the warmongering Nilfgaardian Empire, for women he’s either a) in love with or b) eager to protect. He kills monsters, beasts and bandits along the way. He’s recalcitrant in the face of royal authority. He lets his beard grow. He’s tough.I didn’t like Geralt before I started playing The Witcher games. I’d see his face on marketing material and smirk: he was just another by-the-numbers video game power fantasy. It’s not that this fantasy is thoroughly objectionable to me, but it definitely seemed as if Geralt of Rivia was a boring video game tough guy. A cliche.The truth is, he’s only the video game tough guy cliche you make him. Geralt has his complexities, but he inherits them from you. He’s a malleable character, and I feel more connected to him than I do the thoroughly customised RPG characters in Skyrim. His wit, his ingrained prejudices and allegiances, are just subtle enough that they don’t impinge on my ultimate control of who he is.Before I get to the finer details, here are the cliffnotes: Geralt is tasked with finding the daughter of Emhyr var Emreis, Nilfgaard’s emperor. The Nilfgaardians have taken, by force, most of the regions you’ll visit in The Witcher 3. It’s not immediately obvious whether they’re a force for good or bad (especially if you’ve never played a Witcher game before), but one thing is certain: nothing is going well. The people in The Northern Realms are miserable. There’s the weak and the strong, and no grey area in between. Poverty is everywhere: alcoholism, boredom, listlessness. Nothing is going to be OK, but evidence suggests it was never OK to begin with, Nilfgaardians or not.Matters are complicated by the fact that said Nilfgaardian leader’s daughter, Ciri, is someone dear to Geralt, and that a dark force–the Wild Hunt–is pursuing her. The official mission only lends a wider context to a more personal endeavour on Geralt’s part, as this was a woman he’d trained from a young age, and accepted as a daughter.In true sprawling RPG fashion, that’s not all that The WItcher 3 is about: finding Ciri isn’t the crux of the game’s narrative. Other power struggles come into play later on, and then some other stuff happens, and then… the whole world is at stake and you’re the one to save it. It’s a fantasy RPG, after all, and while the ending is typically grandiose and heartstopping, the main thread would feel a bit rote without its minor story arcs. You won’t care so much that the world is at stake unless you’ve made the effort to learn a bit about it via sidequests. And while newcomers won’t feel punished for skipping the first two games, they’ll miss the rewarding familiarity of old characters and references. To accommodate new players, dialogue options are sprinkled with opportunities to gain background information on plotlines involving historical events.You’ll usually have a handful of main quests in your log, as well as potentially dozens of secondary ones, as well as Witcher contracts (fully fledged, investigation-led monster-slaying jaunts), and each is complemented with cutscenes. Certain secondary quests appear to affect the main narrative proper, and CD Projekt RED has done an admirable job blurring the lines between primary and secondary. Everything in The Witcher 3 feels big: the dungeons are huge and sprawling, the decisions immeasurably consequential, the moral responsibility through the roof.Truth of the matter is that the best stories you’ll take away from The Witcher 3 are peripheral to the main narrative. This is for two reasons: while Geralt is a character that you can’t aesthetically customise to any satisfying degree (you can’t deck him out in mage gowns), you can really make him yours thanks to a nuanced and consequential dialogue system. The second reason is more obvious: the Northern Realms is among the most lifelike, sadly beautiful and strange fantasy worlds ever committed to code, and you’ll want to pick it apart. You play a dual role as Geralt: steely, masculine protagonist on the one hand, and foolhardy, ignorant tourist on the other.As a Witcher, Geralt is armed with two swords and five magic abilities called Signs in addition to bombs, crossbows and other, more spoilery strategies. Combat in The Witcher 3 is simple: slash away at your foes, apply effects and buffs where necessary, roll or block to evade, and sprinkle in sign abilities where needed. These signs include a fiery blast, a telekinetic stun, an offensive shield, a mind control ability, and a static magic trap.While simple to learn, the combat system punishes mindless hacking and slashing against anything but low-level wolves and dogs. Geralt’s cumbersome gait, and your inability to break his animations, means close attention needs to be paid to most encounters. Like the Souls series, a defensive approach is important until you’ve sussed out the weaknesses of your opponent. Some will be resistant to your fire sign, so you may be better off equipping a protective shield, and so on. Overall, it’s satisfying to exercise caution and dexterity, especially at higher difficulty settings where you can’t just meditate to replenish Geralt’s health bar.During my first playthrough I felt that levelling Geralt was excruciatingly slow, but it happens at a fast clip if you know what you’re doing, and skill points can be acquired throughout the world without grinding. There are four main categories to sink levels into, and three have five deeper categories of their own. The problem, early on in the game, is knowing what to prioritise—especially since trees need to be equipped in one of a series of growing slots. I specialised in swordplay and Igni in the early hours (fast attacks and Geralt’s fire ability), but it’s possible to go more defensive. For example, levelling your mind control ability will influence dialogue options against non-aggressive characters.The biggest bone of contention is going to be the alchemy and crafting systems, which are incredibly detailed in The Witcher 3. Geralt finds alchemy blueprints regularly, but happening across the ingredients required to create them is slow unless you know where to look (and you won’t). Thing is, there are hundreds of ingredients, and The Northern Realms are huge. Once you’ve found the ingredients you’ll never need to acquire them again, but when it comes to upgrading armor and weapons it’s important to have a game plan, and it’s unwise to concentrate on improving the lowly weapons you’ll find early game, which are colour coded according to their power.While there’s nothing wrong with complex crafting systems, it’s not improved by The Witcher 3’s dense and sometimes tedious user interface. There’s evidence of console-centric design in the radial menus and keybinds (number buttons can switch between signs but won’t immediately cast them as in Witcher 2), but the inventory and character menus are clearly designed with PC in mind. That said, a few more categories would help: it’s only a matter of hours before your Usable Items and Ingredients tabs are swollen to the brim, with no rhyme or reason as to how items are sorted. Overall, the PC version still feels the best.The PC advantage is obvious when it comes to combat, which benefits from a mouse and keyboard. Due to Geralt’s syrupy movements the ability to more rapidly adjust the camera with the mouse is a saving grace, especially when the game’s lock-on system leaves a lot to be desired. It definitely locks on, but when it comes to scrolling through enemies on the battlefield it’s less than ideal. It’ll usually take a left-to-right approach, rather than a back-to-front approach, which doesn’t work well when you’ve got more than three enemies baying for your blood, and one right up in your face.Having personally played the game across two systems (a high-spec gaming laptop as well as a console build), I can confirm that fighting is much more enjoyable at 60 frames per second. It makes blocking and parrying a lot more readable against human characters, and a little bit of slowdown during evasive moves can prove an annoyance.There are two main regions in The Witcher 3: the aforementioned Velen and The Skellige Isles. There are a few smaller areas, but it’s in these main regions that the bulk of The Witcher 3 plays out. They’re big, of course, but that’s not what matters. The Northern Realms are the most vibrant video game locations I’ve ever seen: less cartoony and more detailed than Dragon Age: Inquisition, and more naturalistic—less uncanny, less janky—than Skyrim. But that’s not hugely important either.What’s important is that when all of the Witcher 3’s environmental elements work in concert—the weather you can forecast by looking at the sky, the foliage that rustles and bends in the breeze—it’s hard not to feel something. When the sun sets it appears to melt in a sea of apocalyptic orange, and you know what? It’s a beautiful, sad orange. The Northern Realms are engaging and lifelike, sure, but they convey melancholy unlike any other open world I’ve encountered.That melancholy extends to the people and situations Geralt encounters too. Witchers are scorned for being mutants and sub-humans, and they’re reputed to not feel anything. The thing is that I, the player, couldn’t help being affected, and while many of the dialogue decisions I made appeared to be morally-inclined, it was sometimes hard to make decisions along those lines without feeling like I’d done something wrong. This is a dark fantasy. It’s dark and horrible and oppressive.This can be alarming. There are some obscenely vicious characters in The Witcher 3 that you’re allowed to feel sympathy for. You might not, but the option is there, and that’s perilous territory for a video game. CD Projekt RED has approached this openness with as much sensitivity as possible, but in the end, it’s hard not to cringe in dismay when you’re given the option to sympathise with a domestically violent character.There are other minor issues with CD Projekt RED’s world-building. There are few fetch quests as such, but there are several occasions where you’ll go to talk to one character, who will advise you to go talk to another character, who will advise you to go seek out four other characters, and so on. In a 100+ hour game these moments barely make a dent, but they’re a clumsy way to present story in a narrative-driven RPG. As incentive to explore the world they don’t work, because there’s ample reason to explore anyway.Then there’s the investigation scenarios, where Geralt uses his Witcher sense to detect telltale signs in the environment. There’s little thought needed on the player’s part, as simply finding the objects will help Geralt deduce his next move. This works especially well in Geralt’s monster contract quests, but as part of grander narratives they could benefit from a little more depth. I’d have liked to be forced to use my brain a bit more.Meanwhile, The Witcher 3 doesn’t bring much that’s bracingly new to the modern RPG. It’s a series of refinements: the questing and attention to detail is better than Skyrim, the pervasive sense of dread is thicker than Fallout 3 and the decisions more impactful than Mass Effect 2. It relies on familiar gameplay beats to tell a story, but shows no evidence of wanting to experiment on a grander scale. I was never surprised by the game’s systems as much as I was intrigued by its setting.Comparing notes with my PC Gamer colleagues, the game ran well on a variety of configurations. Using an Intel i5-2500k processor and an Nvidia GTX 980 at 2560x1440, we were able to run everything on Ultra, barring HairWorks and Foliage Visibility Range, which we ran at High. The game operated comfortably at around 50 fps in 1440p, though with HairWorks on and Foliage set to Ultra, it dipped to 25-35 fps. Meanwhile, using an i7-5960x and Nvidia Titan X, we had no problem maintaining a consistent 60 fps at 1080p. Framerates tended to be more stable compared to another recent heavyhitter, GTA 5.Overall, on a two-year-old system 60 fps should be manageable with some settings adjustments, and while the game really sings at high-to-ultra settings in 1080p, the differences between those settings tend to be subtle. On a high-end laptop I only had framerate issues in specific locations around Velen, where unusually thick foliage and water effects culminated in drops to around the 45 fps mark. Compared to the PS4’s wavering 30 fps and frequent, pre-launch slow downs, it’s a huge improvement.The Witcher 2 still has a reputation for pushing PC graphics to the limit, and while graphics in The Witcher 3 are undoubtedly impressive, it’s not the Crysis many expected it to be. The fidelity matters less here than the scale. As storms approach, and gales rustle and bend tree branches, and as the deers run for cover, it’s hard to dispute this is a gorgeous game. The lighting and weather effects are breathtaking. It’s difficult to resist stopping to stare into the distance.Still, on a granular scale it’s unlikely to endure as the graphical showpiece its predecessor was. You don’t have to look far to find low-quality textures. Foliage is thick and abundant, but leaves are flat 2D textures bisecting to create the illusion of 3D. Clothing still looks thick and lived-in, but not dramatically better than Witcher 2. Facial animations and non-mocapped character animations don’t push any new boundaries and occasionally look awkward or stiff. Skin pores and facial expressions are fine, but even mocapped faces lag behind the most impressive contemporary facial animation.These aren’t criticisms so much as observations that The Witcher 3 isn’t the great leap forward some might have hoped. Designing open worlds like this doesn’t come without compromises. It’s disappointing that it doesn’t live up to the potential showcased in the first trailers, but we can only enjoy what’s in front of us for what it is.It’s the storytelling and art direction that impresses more than the raw details, and these are the reasons The Witcher 3 consumed me. I felt more engaged with the Northern Realms than I ever did Skyrim, and even as the narrative advanced and tension mounted—and even when I felt I knew the lay of the land pretty well—I was still compelled to take it slowly and learn.For a game boasting all of the political treachery and turmoil common in the genre, The Witcher 3 succeeds because it puts people first. More compelling than Geralt’s lofty, heroic journey are the stories about the humdrum, circumstantial horrors of the helpless as they watch their world crumble. I’m looking forward to returning to The Northern Realms and visiting all of its villages and ruins. That’s where the heart of The Witcher 3 lies: not in its hero, but in the complicated world it brings to life.A big, beautiful, sprawling action RPG full of rich stories, and suffused with an oppressive darkness.Shaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

Eurogamer,"Out now in a new complete edition, this is a landmark RPG.The Witcher 3 has been released in a new Game of the Year edition, which includes its two expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. To mark the occasion, here's our review of this remarkable game, first published on 18th May 2015. Below you'll also find links to our reviews of the two expansions.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the game that Poland's iconoclastic CD Projekt Red has been threatening to make for a while now, ever since it debuted this dark fantasy series, based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski, in 2007. Made by a rogue operator with independent funding (the studio's parent company owns the distribution platform GOG.com), it pays little heed to the franchise-building fads of Hollywood or the focus-tested game design methodologies of Montreal, instead drinking deep draughts from Central European folklore and the narrative traditions of Western role-playing. It exists because a group of people in Warsaw knew exactly the kind of game they wanted to play, and made it themselves because no-one else would. It is that rare thing in contemporary video games: an epic with a soul.As well as several free updates and add-ons, the Witcher 3 received two major expansions: Hearts of Stone, and Blood and Wine. All of this content is included in the Game of the Year edition.In our Hearts of Stone review, Cassandra wrote: ""In its best moments, Hearts of Stone is hilarious and harrowing and hopeful, sometimes all at the same time. In its worst moments, though? It's okay."" The expansion adds a new storyline, a handful of side-quests, a runecrafting system, and expands a corner of the original game map.Blood and Wine adds a large new map, a new storyline, dozens of side-quests, a mutations system and an upgradeable vineyard. In our Blood and Wine review, Johnny wrote: ""Blood and Wine is a fitting swansong for The Witcher 3. It's a playful goodbye, but also a testament to what made the series so good in the first place... It's an emotional yet mirthful fairytale; one every Witcher fan ought to experience.""As in the previous games, you play Geralt of Rivia, a witcher: a freelance monster hunter with mutant blood who uses swordsmanship, alchemy, a little light magic and some finely-honed tracking skills to get his prey. He's also something of a sleuth, and a mercenary, and a drifter, and a ladies' man. He wanders into town on horseback with his own agenda and gets reluctantly sucked into local affairs, thwarting evil for a sack of gold, picking at society's scabs and then moving on, leaving a trail of swooning wenches in his wake. He has scars and white hair and speaks in a monotonous macho rasp. He's a little bit Philip Marlowe, a little bit Conan the Barbarian, a little bit Solid Snake, a little bit Clint Eastwood's nameless cowboy. In short, he's the archetypal pulp hero - no more than a gruff cartoon, but a pretty appealing one.The prospect of filling this vengeful outcast's kinky boots is so alluring that it doesn't matter too much if you're not up to speed with the Witcher series. Wild Hunt doesn't waste time explaining its busy cast list or elaborate ongoing plotline, in which the political and military machinations of kings and sorcerers inevitably get mixed up with Geralt's complicated love life. There are many cameos and narrative threads that will please fans as much as they confuse newcomers, but the big picture is always clear and easy to follow. Geralt is searching for his ward and (sort of) fellow Witcher, a whip of a young swordswoman called Ciri, who is also being pursued by a chilling band of spectral knights called the Wild Hunt. He spends much of the game trading his services for information pertaining to her whereabouts.There's a bigger picture than that, though: simply living the life of an itinerant monster hunter, plying his trade across a vast and richly drawn fantasy kingdom. There is - and this is where it stands head and shoulders, I feel, above the vast majority of open-word games - no part of The Witcher 3 that doesn't play into this fantasy in a meaningful and entertaining way. There's nothing that feels tacked on (apart, perhaps, from the perfunctory horse races); no map icon that turns out to be nothing more than a collectable doodad, no system that is just a free-spinning hamster-wheel of makework. The main quest doesn't neglect monster-hunting, of course, even if the device of a local dignitary holding back some tidbit of gossip until you deal with their crone or griffin problem is overused. In any event, Geralt's strain of self-interested heroism makes just as much sense when he's negotiating the snake-pit of an urban criminal underworld. This part of the game - its middle act, taking place in the city of Novigrad - is the talkiest part of what is already a very chatty game, and what begins as a welcome change of pace does get a little claustrophobic. Afterwards, however, we're back to the richly satisfying rustic high adventure. The focus narrows from the sprawling landmass of the game's midsection to a series of ever-smaller discrete locations, funnelling you towards a tight conclusion - though Witcher newcomers might find themselves feeling a little alienated at this point, as the plot diligently connects dots and ties loose ends from across the series.If anything, Wild Hunt gets better when you stray from the narrative mainline. The Witcher contracts available from most of the muddy hamlets and crumbling fortresses you visit follow a fun, compulsive and romantically exciting formula: use Geralt's heightened Witcher senses to track some frightening beast or spectre across the land and learn what you can of it; prepare for the fight by brewing the appropriate potions, explosives and oils; battle what amounts to a free-roaming mini-boss and claim your trophy.The secondary quests, meanwhile, show an admirable resistance to filler and grind, pushing a form of social storytelling that colours in the messy and morally squalid world of Temeria. There's a war on, between haughty imperialists and fanatical nationalists, and the poor are caught in the middle. More fantastical stories dwell on equally tragic, more personal themes; the game's fearsome bestiary invariably preys on, or is born out of, human frailty.Sapkowski's universe is built on basic fantasy foundations - dragons, elves and magic in an alternate medieval Europe - but has a distinctive flavour. You'll find the politicking and grim brutality of Game of Thrones here, but also the lusty derring-do of Conan and the creepy allegories of the Brothers Grimm. It's a grimy, ugly and violent world - but it's not a dour dystopia. There's humour and sex and lyricism, and a cast of believable characters doing human things for messed-up human reasons. It's telling that the lore entries you unlock as you play aren't dry accounts of the world's history, but the immediate backstories of its characters or anatomies of its monsters. This is no land of long ago; it's a fantasy world that exists in the present tense.CD Projekt brings all this to life to thrilling effect. The landscape is rugged and fertile, sometimes twisted but never bleak, soaked in a sense of place so pungent you can smell it. It's lit by lurid orange sunsets breaking under ashen storm clouds, and lashed by wind and rain. (The decision to animate the trees fully in the wind must have caused the programmers untold pain, but boy is there an atmospheric pay-off.) It feels alive. What impresses most is the combination of sheer size with a kind of geographical intimacy, every creek and ruin feeling like a place with a past. It is, as Matt Wales claimed last week, a masterpiece of world-building.Each time you check a village noticeboard for quests, the map is spattered with question marks denoting 'undiscovered locations'. But these are not the busywork you might expect. They're bandit encampments and monster dens and smuggler's caches, most concealing good loot, some starting significant quest lines. Notably, they feel like they belong, arising organically from the setting rather than scattered by the hand of designers tasked with turning a 50-hour game into a 200-hour one. Ignoring questing completely to explore these spots is a fully enjoyable and rewarding way to play The Witcher 3. In fact, my favourite moments with the game have been spent on scavenger hunts, chasing down legendary Witcher armour and weapons based on treasure maps bought from merchants, and finding them in dank little dungeons or remote ruined towers infested with harpies. That, for me, is the essence of a role-playing adventure.Mechanically, Wild Hunt is sleek and serviceable rather than inspiring - but again, CD Projekt's unwavering focus on selling its chosen fantasy pays off handsomely. Combat, crafting, character customisation and the economy are all relatively simple and judiciously balanced to keep you hungry. Grinding out an advantage is seldom an option. This is a game where you make money to spend money and frequently find yourself with empty pockets, making do with what you can lay your hands on. You live like an adventurer, in other words, rather than a homicidal magic millionaire, as you do in so many other RPGs.Combat, much streamlined from the previous games (and much better explained in the tutorial stages), combines strikes, dodges, parries and counters with gadgets and magical attacks. It is hardly as refined an action-RPG as Bloodborne, say, but it has punch - even humble enemies can take a big chunk out of your health if you're not careful. Potions heal you and increase your power, but raise your toxicity to a knife-edge where too much will kill you. A remarkably small percentage of your time is spent fighting, and caution and preparation are usually advisable, as is tailoring Geralt's strengths to your taste in the skill tree.Away from fights, crafting new potions and equipment is a compelling time-sink that will have you scouring merchants' inventories and loot chests for recipes and rare ingredients. Some of the best stuff in the game is seriously out of the way. No matter how slowly and painstakingly you play, The Witcher 3 always pays back your time with interest. That's a remarkable achievement in a game of this scale.No less remarkably, you can also say that of Wild Hunt as a work of fiction. Rough in places, it still has more texture, more nuance and more unrefined human vigour in its writing and performance than the great majority of its triple-A peers. Storylines always hold your attention and seldom feel like set-dressing. Choices are genuinely ambiguous and have subtle or unexpected outcomes, sometimes long after you'd forgotten you'd made them. The dialogue, although there is reams of it, has an understated authenticity and takes care not to serve its exposition dry. (The Witcher 3 features some of the best, most natural swearing I've ever encountered in video games, delivered by a spirited voice cast in an enjoyably broad range of British regional accents - including Brummie and Welsh.)It's not without missteps. For one thing, this is an unapologetically hyper-masculine power fantasy, set in a feudal world that is sometimes gruesomely misogynistic. There are a lot of ludicrously revealing necklines and CD Projekt can be so dogged in its pursuit of moral ambiguity that it winds up muddying waters that ought to be crystal clear. (At one point, a wife-beating alcoholic baron is redeemed and made sympathetic; his wife, naturally, cheated on him.) And yet: The Witcher 3 doesn't dehumanise, neuter or ignore women the way so many games do. This is because it doesn't dehumanise anyone the way so many games do. The storylines that tackle oppression do so with empathy rather than righteousness. Even its adolescent sauciness has a kind of honesty: this is a video game in which sex is messy and fun and, well, sexy, as opposed to the calculating negotiation it is in BioWare's games (or the pervy sideshow it is everywhere else).This is why I love The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is crass in some places and overreaching in others, but despite its grandeur and its fantastical setting, it is a game made by, for and about human beings. It's lewd and perverse and poetic and hot-blooded. It's huge yet crafted; its systems are purposeful and it doesn't have a whiff of design by committee. It will last you months, yet not waste your time. Above all, it has a vivid, enduring personality, something that is exceedingly rare among its breed of mega-budget open-world epics (and that will probably be rarer still once Hideo Kojima and Konami part ways later this year). For my money, it's the greatest role-playing game in years.Additional reviewing by Matt Wales

Metro GameCentral,"GameCentral attempts to play the PS5 update of The Witcher 3 and finds CD Projekt has learned nothing from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in 2020 was a teachable moment for the entire games industry. Rushed out to make sure it was released before Christmas; the game was a technical disaster on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and filled with so many bugs it meant the game was barely playable. The immediate ramifications were severe, with talk of creator CD Projekt going under and other publishers seemingly terrified of releasing their own games in a similar state, lest they suffer the same consequences.That terror lasted for all of three months, before everyone went back to their old ways, releasing broken games that never work properly until months later – most publishers apparently satisfied that the quickly forgotten anger of a few hardcore gamers was nothing compared to the benefits of meeting a deadline. You would think that at least CD Projekt might be more cautious, but unfortunately this belated next gen update for The Witcher 3 suggests otherwise.The Witcher 3 was first released in 2015, to near universal acclaim. Since it takes well over 50 hours to beat we haven’t had time to play the whole thing, so this won’t be a scored review, although that’s just as well given the technical problems…Playing it seven years on, it’s still clear why The Witcher 3 was such a huge success. It’s massive, deep, and has a wonderfully human earthiness to it, so often missing from more clinical Japanese role-playing games. Nothing quite like it has been released since, despite numerous attempts to replicate its magic, with developer CD Projekt not yet returning to the same universe (although they will, relatively soon).Although seven years is plenty of time for technology to march on, the thing that feels creakiest in The Witcher 3 is its combat, but that was criticised even at the time and so it’s no surprise to find it hasn’t got any better in the interim. The lock-on still frequently targets distant enemies instead of close ones and there’s a general sense of wobbliness, even if compared with fellow all-time classic Skyrim, it is considerably better – Witcher’s balletic pirouettes and coy little dodges at least look as though main character Geralt is making an effort.The Witcher didn’t earn its fame through its combat, but through the standout quality and intricacy of its quests, which remain just as impressive now as they ever were. Even seemingly innocuous side missions can balloon into their own little novellas, drawing in colourful characters and strange corners of the map. You’ll also regularly find your good intentions waylaid by deceitful quest givers or unintended consequences, many of which don’t make themselves felt until later in the game.On PlayStation 5 the addition of haptic feedback for all sorts of actions, from landing sword blows to selling items to merchants, makes for a lightly refreshed experience. You’ll also feel the adaptive triggers adding a bit of extra weight to fights, although it’s the short load times that make the biggest difference overall.There are numerous further updates to discover. The expected ray-tracing and performance modes on current generation consoles and PC are joined by cross-platform progression, so you can use GOG.com to save your game and then continue on a totally different device if you want. There’s also a new mission that lets you earn armour and weapons from the Netflix series.Most useful though, are the re-tooled menus, making it much easier to switch magical signs and trigger them in combat. It works really well, giving a better flow to the action and meaning you spend less time fiddling about in menu screens. Along with a simplified map view, that by default isn’t flooded with icons, the interface is generally excellent, and a palpable improvement over the original.Arguably The Witcher 3’s best bit, though, is its characters. Geralt himself, the powerful witches he likes to surround himself with, and the inspiringly motley crew of people you meet, fight, and do jobs for remain a highlight. He may sound like Batman, growling rather than speaking his lines, but Geralt is still immensely likeable, if you choose to role-play him that way.It’s a shame, then, that this update is let down by a litany of bugs. Even after installing a patch, there are numerous technical problems: Geralt’s head and shoulders glitch out in the inventory screen, his hair flutters in the breeze indoors, and distant pieces of scenery don’t so much pop in as strobe across the screen. There were plenty of times parts of quests failed to trigger as intended, even on main story missions. No doubt there’ll be a flurry of patches, for day one and beyond, but that is very far from the point.There are even hard crashes; times when you get stuck irrevocably in the inventory, needing to close and reopen the game; and even bugs from the original that were previously patched out but have now mysteriously returned. It’s not quite as bad as Cyberpunk 2077 was when it launched, but the repeated delays for the update and releasing just before Christmas, no matter what, show that CD Projekt has learned absolutely nothing from the disaster that nearly destroyed the company.At least the game does look stunning, though, when you’re not starring at a blue screen of death. Character models have been given a wash and brush up, and the new 4K textures add even more grandeur to the landscapes. This includes the expansions Hearts Of Stone and Blood And Wine, each of which come with a distinct and beautifully rendered new landmass to explore.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationSadly, though, it’s impossible to recommend the game in its current state. Despite the renewed beauty there are just too many annoying little problems. The update is free, if you already own a last gen version, so all you need to do is wait until it’s all fixed, but as the first major release since Cyberpunk 2077 this is a colossal failure, of the sort you’d think CD Projekt would do anything to avoid.This is likely to be the definitive version of a great game, and an excellent excuse to dive back into its gloriously rich and varied world, but at the moment it’s a bug-ridden mess that’s more trouble to play than the seven-year-old original. We’re sure by next Christmas it’ll all be running perfectly but all you get this year is a lump of 4K coal.Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed) and Xbox Series X/SPrice: £34.99Publisher: CD ProjektDeveloper: CD Projekt RedRelease Date: 14th December 2022Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Metro GameCentral,"An open world RPG to make even Skyrim look small, and some of the best graphics ever seen, but is The Witcher 3 as good as it looks?Playing a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age for hundreds of hours, you end up spending so much time in their virtual worlds that they become a real place to you; full of memories, favourite people, and hated enemies. It’d take well over 200 hours to see everything, and complete every last side quest, in The Witcher 3, but we’re confident that many will end up doing exactly that. Because this is a game world you won’t want to leave.The Witcher 3 can be see as pretty much a direct cross between Dragon Age: Inquisition and Skyrim. It has the third person view, moral choices, and multiple open world environments of BioWare’s game, but the real-time combat and open-ended structure is more reminiscent of The Elder Scrolls. For some genre fans that will be all they need to hear, but The Witcher 3 is far more than just a new spin on old ideas.If you’re new to the franchise, and considering the first game was PC-only and the second one wasn’t on PlayStation 3 that is more than likely, the basic set-up is very easy to grasp. The games are based on a series of Polish fantasy novels and star Geralt of Rivia – a supernatural monster hunter called a witcher, who despite his abilities is distrusted and persecuted by much of the populace.The Witcher 3’s story revolves around an invading demonic army but much like the Elder Scrolls games it’s a fairly distant concern for much of the game, and simply exploring the countryside and making a living are much more pressing concerns for the first several hours.Although they were far from linear the first two Witcher games didn’t have any true open world environments. But The Witcher 3 is 20 per cent bigger than even Skyrim, which is impressive but at the beginning actually creates an unfortunate sense of déjà vu. The Witcher’s fantasy world and creatures aren’t so distinctive that the procedural style opening – of learning the controls, getting a feel for the game world, and taking a first look at the Ubisoft style map filled with tempting icons – doesn’t feel worryingly overfamilar.It takes four or five hours, but eventually The Witcher’s own personality begins to shine through – as well as your own influence on the world. Choosing to rescue a villager from a gang of thieves or curing a sick herbalist isn’t just a case of earning experience points and then moving on. Your actions can alter everything from the prices in shops and the side quests available, to whether a town is prematurely invaded. But so too can everything from the weather to the time of day, creating what is arguably the most believable and interactive video game world ever seen.It’s also one of the most attractive, although again we suspect many will be slightly disappointed at first – as a result of watching too many trailers that are clearly taken from the PC version. But the console versions still look great, with the epic landscapes enhanced by some excellent art design and good use of colour. There are a lot of screen-tearing and frame rate issues though, as well as other random bugs. The inevitable day one patch is claimed to fix them all but, well… we’re sure you’ve heard that one before.In terms of pure gameplay the most consistently enjoyable element is unquestionably the monster hunting – encounters with larger foes which are so dangerous that you have to research and plan well in advance. Lures have to be created, lairs recced, and information sources pumped for information on weak points. Some of these steps can be skipped if you’re foolhardy, but not only are these some of the toughest battles in the game, but the sense of anticipation your careful planning creates works extremely well at increasing the tension.In terms of the actual combat some elements have been simplified form the previous games, but only in the sense that it’s now faster and more intuitive. The clumsy combos of the last game, whose animations couldn’t be interrupted, are long gone and although Geralt is visibly older than before he feels more spry and athletic when in action.Using magic spells called Signs is also easier than before, as you lob fireballs, set traps to slow down enemies, or use what is basically a Jedi Force push. Most Signs also have a kind of secondary fire mode, where for example a simple trap can be transformed into a magical firing turret. Some Signs can also be used outside of battle, to influence conversations Ben Kenobi style.Lesser enemies can also be studied beforehand for an advantage in combat, with Geralt possessing a supersense that not only lets him track smells and footprints but also highlights weak points on a foe, which can then be aimed at specifically using a brief slow motion effect. Despite all this the combat in itself isn’t anything extraordinary, but it strikes just the right balance of complexity and accessibility given everything else that’s going on in the game.On top of this you’ve got potions and explosives which you craft yourself using collected items. The crafting system becomes extremely complicated when you’re dealing with weapons and armour, as the exact nature of the raw ingredients – many of which are vital body parts culled from defeated enemies – greatly influences the resulting equipment.As good as The Witcher 3 is we have to admit we’ve never really enjoyed the previous two games as much as we feel we should, in large part because the tone of the game world has always seemed a little off. The mean streak of misogyny from the earlier games is gone (you actually control a female character now, in a few linear story sections) but there’s still an element of try-hard machismo about the whole setting, especially in Geralt’s absurdly gravelly video game hero voice.Although of course the great achievement of The Witcher 3 is that you can refine his outlook to either play up the role of virtual badass or be the more morally-driven character we were more comfortable with. We’ve never seen a video game with both this volume of moral choices and lasting consequences for them, most of which are entirely unintended.Bad things often happen despite the best of intentions, and entirely self-motivated choices can actually lead to a positive outcome for all. And while there are a few moustache-twirling villains most of the characters in the game are far more nuanced; which is to say they’re as petty, altruistic, and apathetic as any real person would be in their situation.As much as it can be said for any story-based video game, the world of The Witcher 3 seems indifferent to your existence and machinations. You must simply try to survive it the best way you can, in the manner which suits you best. But perhaps The Witcher 3’s greatest feat is that it feels like everyone else in the game is doing the same thing too, whether they’re a lowly peasant, feudal lord, or a grey-haired, monster-hunter…In Short: A colossal achievement in technical terms, with a level of interaction with the game world and its inhabitants that is unsurpassed in modern video games.Pros: Huge open world environment with a staggering level of detail, and interactivity – where your every decision really does matter. Excellent graphics and great monster hunts.Cons: The opening few hours cover a lot of familiar territory if you’ve played other, similar games. Combat is solid but never remarkable. Lots of bugs and graphical issues pre-release.Score: 9/10

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Trees bend and sway, storms blow across the landscape, buzzards circle overhead. The Witcher 3’s world moves in a way that game worlds haven’t before. It’s one of the busiest ever made, and while it’s not the biggest in terms of raw square footage, it teems with life: human and otherwise. The Northern Kingdoms are both extraordinarily beautiful and sickening at the same time. For every cracked castle artfully placed on the horizon, there's a tree full of hanging men. You're constantly confronted by astonishing views, but something murderous always lurks in the bushes nearby.It's a place of almost relentless suffering. Humans are largely scattered across a network of small villages that you can travel between at will once the map opens up after the prologue, by horse or on foot. The starving peasants that inhabit these rickety townships are easy prey for the creatures that surround them. As Geralt, a professional monster hunter, you move from place to place, using untidy combat to dispatch their supernatural tormentors for money. The Witcher 3 is at its best when you choose solely to wander, taking sidequests from peasants and contracts from town noticeboards. Freed from the convolutions of the main plot, it's a varied and exciting realisation of the Ronin fantasy.The overarching story centres on Geralt's adopted daughter, Ciri. As a child of the “elder blood”, she can teleport between worlds. A cohort of otherworldly riders called The Wild Hunt want to harness that ability so they can invade other worlds en masse. You have to find Ciri before they do, which is a suitable enough excuse to ride around meeting each region's most powerful figures, like the rotund and coarse Bloody Baron in the swamps of Velen; the criminal gangs of the game's huge capital city, Novigrad; and the would-be kings and queens of The Witcher 3's most extraordinary location, the isles of Skellige.Tragically, all of these areas suffer from chronic framerate issues on the PS4 review build provided. CD Projekt RED included a letter promising that optimisation continues and a 'day zero' patch will fix things, but it's possible some of these problems will remain immediately after launch. The jerkiness seriously affects the fluidity of combat, and sporadic slowdown appears in cutscenes, and particularly in dense areas like the Velen bogs during graphically intense weather conditions like rain storms.There are so many aspects of The Witcher 3 I'd love to talk about that won't fit into the main review: the quests for legendary armour, the blueprints that let you craft great gear or brew better potions. The main one is Gwent, a card game that almost everyone in the Northern Kingdoms plays. You can challenge merchants, blacksmiths and warlords to games so you can win more cards, build better decks and challenge the world's masters. It's deep, and stupidly addictive.The slippery framerate exacerbates issues with the combat system, which remains largely unchanged from the Witcher 2, and has inherited all of its problems. You attack by stringing together light and strong slaps with your sword, and can use an array of magical signs to protect yourself or pulverise others. The essential Quen spell casts a shield that negates a blow. Igni roasts enemies with a flame blast. Yrden lays a trap that slows them to a drunken crawl. Aard pushes them back with concussive force, and Axii stupifies enemies.The long-range dodge can theoretically be used to dive out of the way of monster swipes and the new short-range dodge is designed to let you pirouette around strikes so you can counter, but both are very inconsistent in practice. Expect to take a lot of unfair hits, even in cases when the enemy's strike clearly sailed past you. This problem is instantly fixed when you step into Ciri's shoes for one of her brief playable flashback sequences. Her dodge is a short-range teleport, and is immediately more satisfying.It's telling that you feel much more like a mutant blademaster when fighting humans and harpies in particular. Humans can be parried, which adds a vital extra layer of interaction, and harpies can be shot down with your miniature crossbow and then finished with a decisive stab. Otherwise, your moveset is slim. The differentiation between light and strong attacks is meaningless, and Geralt never seems to get back to an opponent quickly enough after a dodge (Ciri gains a dash move ability later, further improving her sections). Geralt always feels more cumbersome than his elaborate spinning animations imply, and less deadly, even in spite of the bloody dismemberment that happens when he finishes an enemy.You can fix things a little with the upgrade system, which lets you invest level-up points into close combat skills to increase your damage, and signs, to unlock new variations on the basic set. The move that reduces damage you take while dodging is useful. Other standouts include the Quen variation that lets you hold a button to cast a continuous protective shield that heals you when hit. The Igni variant that shoots a continuous plume of embers from your palm is also deadly, and looks incredible. The frustrations of combat are also ameliorated at lower difficulty levels, where enemies are less resilient.Fortunately, fighting is one part of the Witcher 3 package, and the rewards are too great to let average swordplay ruin the wider adventure. Besides, to track his daughter, Geralt must become as much a detective as a warrior. His new medieval-CSI vision ability lets him pick clues out of the environment in hazy red outlines. Footprints, blood, scents, and magical artefacts light up so you can follow prey and identify monsters. You do this an awful lot, but it works, pulling you through locations in a more interesting way than an objective marker would, and the mysteries you investigate are consistently interesting.When you travel to one of Skellige's islands to find a lost expedition, the island becomes one huge, fascinating forensic crime scene. Other plots are just as involved, confronting you with twisted takes on the creatures and curses of old European folklore. These stories have ancient roots, and their authenticity conveys a grim, earthy texture to the world - a quality unique to The Witcher series. The main plot is lacking - you spend a big chunk of it chasing someone who's having a more important and exciting adventure than you - but the trove of sidequests makes up for that with a compilation of dark fantasy short stories.Good voice acting (for the most part) and superb facial animation makes the characters and creatures you meet fun to banter with, but be warned: you also meet a lot of returning characters from previous Witcher games. If you know nothing about the Geralt/Triss/Yennefer love triangle, or the Lodge of Sorceresses, or the convoluted series of wars and betrayals that precede the game, a significant amount of the main thread will seem completely baffling. It's worth playing The Witcher 2, or reading up on the series, before you start.I dearly hope that the 'day zero' patch eliminates The Witcher 3’s technical issues. They’re the main blemish on an otherwise rich and lengthy RPG. Even so, The Witcher 3 represents a generational leap in world design and fidelity, and is a spectacle that deserves to be savoured at its very best.This game was reviewed on PS4 using review code provided by Bandai-Namco.The Witcher Monopoly game will punish you for being Team TrissWitcher 3 dev reveals his favorite detail from the RPG's weirdest questThe 10 best horror films (that no one thinks are horror films)By Sam Loveridge18 October 2023By Will Sawyer17 October 2023By Alex Berry17 October 2023By Tabitha Baker17 October 2023By Neil Smith16 October 2023By Emily Murray16 October 2023By Joe Donnelly16 October 2023By Jon Bailes16 October 2023By Fay Watson14 October 2023By Emily Murray13 October 2023By Benjamin Abbott13 October 2023GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Game Informer,"Ever since The Witcher's 2007 debut, the series has been raising the bar for choice and consequence in role-playing games. Every entry in the series has taken the concept one step further, but The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the most ambitious attempt yet, showing the ripple effect of tons of choices across a large world. CD Projekt RED doesn't disappoint, proving once again why it's a genre juggernaut. With abundant improvements, a bigger world, and more exciting choices on every level, The Witcher 3 is one of the best games I've played in recent years, providing a stimulating challenge on and off the battlefield.What makes the choices so interesting is the immersive world that they shape. From snowy mountain tops to beautiful waterfalls to wildlife running across the forests, CD Projekt RED created a landscape with an excruciating amount of detail that makes it a thrill to explore. You never know when you might find a hidden cave, discover a hidden treasure underwater, or stumble upon crafting materials for potions or new armor. The towns feel alive with events happening all around, like drunken bar fights and houses burning down. You never feel like a bystander – you are a part of what's going on around you. You can choose how involved you want to get, and even little choices carry consequences. For instance, I told off a religious man preaching about the dangers of witchers, and he later sent thugs to beat me up. Unlike games that offer a few key choices to alter the narrative, The Witcher 3 provides abundant options that can shape the world in all kinds of ways. Hundreds of quests are available across the map, focusing on monster contracts and treasure hunts, while smaller story quests center on the inhabitants of each town. I was surprised at the variety and how well-written the quests are – everything holds an unexpected story, like a jealous woman trying to steal her sister's werewolf boyfriend. It made exploring the world a blast; I always looked forward to revisiting past people I helped to see what path I set them on. In one case, I chose between a brother and sister for the throne and saw the empire flourish due to my decision.I've never felt so connected and like I had so much power over a virtual world before. The dilemmas are some of best in the series. You have plenty of ways to solve them (like brute force, doing favors, and using witcher powers), but I never felt judged for any of my choices. My favorite part is how the writers are always one step ahead and my decisions are never safe; the shades of gray mean that you never know who to trust, requiring you think carefully about every situation. The world is brutal, full of liars and tricksters just waiting to outsmart you. Would you trust someone who tells you to throw a baby in the oven if it's for the greater good? I didn't – but maybe I should have.The main narrative is also intriguing, but only fans who have been following the series will get the most out of it. Geralt remains the composed hero we've come to know, but he's no longer a blank slate with his memories back. This entry explores his past and shows a more emotional side of him thanks to Ciri. She is like a daughter to Geralt, and he must find her before the dangerous Wild Hunt organization uses her for evil. Seeing Geralt react as a father would in this dire situation is an interesting change for the character.
 
In addition, new and returning personalities have fascinating developments. Geralt's former flame Triss has her own storyline about fighting against the persecution of mages. The writers handle every situation with authenticity – Triss and Yennefer's complicated relationships with Geralt in particular. The romances have more substance than what CD Projekt RED has provided before, with better build up and discussing more complex emotions and topics. These romantic plots were too abrupt in previous entries, but I was satisfied this time around.Great writing and intense decisions aside, the gameplay has also vastly improved. This is the most accessible entry yet, thanks to different difficulty settings, a better interface, more lenient weight restrictions, and a less demanding alchemy system. Combat is much more responsive and action-packed compared to the stilted experience of past entries. This doesn't sacrifice any of the difficulty; outside of playing on story mode, a great deal of strategy is required in the tense battles. Exploiting enemy weaknesses with spells, crafting potions to give you an edge, blocking at the right time for counterattacks, and dodging in the nick of time are still of the utmost importance.You are always in danger, even during basic exploration. Enemies can strike from anywhere, including the air and underwater. The new crossbow eases the pain of flying enemies, but it wasn't my favorite weapon. Even with upgrades, I found it a pain to aim and fire at enemies, slowing the momentum of battle. Still, whether you are taking down a difficult monster contract or participating in an adrenaline-pumping scripted battle, fighting is intense and fun, forcing you to exploit every weapon in your arsenal. You can also upgrade your character any way you want, focusing on the areas you prefer, such as magic, physical attacks, and alchemy.I have very few complaints about The Witcher 3, but it does have some minor nuisances, such as some long load times. Breakable weapons also interrupted my adventure more often than they should have (you can only repair them by finding a craftsman or buying armor repair kits). Addtionally, I wasn't too impressed with the scenes where you play as Ciri.  She's an awesome character so I liked getting to know her better, but these sequences were far from exciting. Ciri is more agile than Geralt, but she doesn't have access to magic and the fights just felt too simple. Also, some late-game locations are unnecessarily difficult to access, lacking good fast-travel options. Sometimes the witcher sense for investigating crime scenes gets overused, but I still enjoyed using it to piece together mysteries.By the end of the game, 36 different world states are available, depending on your actions. The main story also has multiple endings, and some are definitely more satisfying than others, which I wish wasn't the case. In such a big game, you want to walk away feeling like your time was well spent. My initial ending rubbed me the wrong way, and the disappointment lingered long after the credits rolled. For the most part though, I reveled in the experience leading up to it, even more than I did in past games.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt encompasses what I hope is the future of RPGs. It stands out for its wonderful writing, variety of quests and things to do in the world, and how your choices have impact in interesting ways. Usually something is sacrificed when creating a world this ambitious, but everything felt right on cue. I still think about some of my choices and how intriguing they turned out – for better or worse. Note: This review is based on the PS4 version of the game. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also available on Xbox One and PC.

   on December 13, 2022 at 11:27AM PSTIn The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the sacred is always at war with the profane, and beauty is always at war with blood. The series has always contrasted its world's physical glamor with its intrinsic violence, but never has that contrast been this uneasy, this convulsive. That The Witcher 3 depicts the immediate brutality of battle in great detail is not a surprise; many games fill the screen with decapitated heads and gory entrails. It's the way this incredible adventure portrays the personal tragedies and underhanded opportunities that such battles provide that makes it so extraordinary.It is more than its thematic turbulence that makes The Witcher 3 extraordinary, actually. Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Skellige and in the city of Novigrad, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

The central story, which sees you seeking your ward and daughter figure Ciri, as well as contending with the otherworldly force known as the wild hunt, often forces this anguish upon you. But it was my natural exploration of the game's vast expanses that proved most affecting. At one point, I witnessed a woman sentenced to death, doomed to starve after being chained to a rock. It's a chilling sentence, of course, but it was only later, when I accidentally sailed past the tiny island where her corpse still rested, that the horror of her punishment sunk into my heart. The Witcher 3's story did not script this moment; it was merely a passing detail that might have been lost in the waves or overlooked in favor of the harpies circling overhead. Yet there she was, a reminder that my actions--actions that felt righteous and reasonable as I made them--allowed this woman to rot in this faraway place.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings touched on similar repercussions, but The Witcher 3 makes them personal. Political tensions run as hot as they always have in this series, and your decisions still divert the paths of barons and kings in intriguing ways. But where The Witcher 2's focus on plot came at the expense of characterization, the sequel gives the wartime struggle great heft by giving Geralt intimate connections to every major player. The connection between Ciri and Geralt proves to be the story's strongest driving force, but Ciri is not a damsel to be rescued, though it may seem so at first, especially in this particular world. This is a place where women struggle to find respect as political candidates, as armorsmithing masters, and even as proper members of a functioning culture.Roasting a crowd of witch hunters is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress.Women, as it happens, are also this story's strongest force. If you have played a Witcher game before, you know many of them already. The most powerful of them are former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses, few of them outright likable, and each of them defiant in the face of death. In certain circumstances, you take control of Ciri herself, and she wields swords just as capably as a witcher does. (Her phantom dashes also bring a zippiness to her sections that Geralt lacks.) The occasional dose of gratuitous toplessness sometimes proves to be a needle scratch, particularly in a sauna scene that seems to have been constructed specifically to get you up close and personal with a woman's anatomy. In other moments, however, the nudity is a natural element of a scene's sensuality, such as the tutorial scene that features Yennefer and Geralt sharing a relaxed intimacy that surpasses the obvious physical connection.The Witcher 3 is enormous in scope, though ""big"" is just a descriptor, a statement of neither good nor bad. It is fortunate, then, that The Witcher 3 does not subscribe to the ""make a big world and fill it with copy-paste content"" design philosophy. Instead, it finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe. You follow a path not just because there's a question mark on your map, but also because it must lead somewhere new and interesting. The intrigue builds naturally: Every quest is a story of sadness or triumph waiting to absorb you, asking you to make decisions that change the landscape in various ways. You won't always know what the consequences are; some decisions have noticeable, game-altering repercussions, while others barely draw your gaze. But the consequences are there, and you often notice them, even though the game doesn't go out of its way to call attention to them.Of course, story quests, side quests, and monster-killing contracts typically involve the same set of activities: killing, talking, and activating your witcher senses, which reveal footprints and scent trails and turn Geralt into a particularly violent private investigator. It is the details that keep every task as inviting as the one that came before. It might be a change of scenery that turns an otherwise typical contract into a clash for the ages: you pull out your crossbow and shoot a screaming wyvern out of the sky with a well-placed bolt, then plunge your silver sword into its heart, all while a fire rages in the outpost beyond and lightning bolts tear across the dark sky. It might be fear that disrupts your state of mind: you search for spirits as you trudge through a murky swamp, lighting the mist with the green light that emanates from your magical lantern. The Witcher 3 makes grand gestures and small ones, too; you may battle werewolves and match wits with kings and barons, but hearing an angel-voiced trobairitz sing a plaintive ballad is a stunning show-stopper.The writing can be best described as ""lusty."" Many of the land's inhabitants serve a god, but their gods have no apparent problem with them making murderous accusations and shouting obscenities. It's fitting that these people would turn to the gods yet curse them in turn, given fields ravaged by battle and littered with bloated corpses. There are a few moments that reveal the screenplay's seams: some of Geralt's lines may not make sense if you choose them in a particular order, for instance, and Geralt is concerned only with money and prefers to stay out of politics, except for when he's not like that at all, because the plot demands as much. But at least the witcher's signature dry growl remains intact, and the rambunctious Irish and Scottish accents that pervade particular regions may inspire you to head to the pub and grab a pint.As cutting as some characters' wit may be (Sigismund Dijkstra's sarcastic barbs make him one of the game's foul-mouthed delights), you do most of your cutting with the blades sheathed on your back. The Witcher 2's combat was overly demanding at the outset, but The Witcher 3 is substantially easier; I recommend, in fact, that you choose a difficulty level one notch higher than the one you would typically choose, presuming you don't default to the most stringent one straight away. Even when things get easy, however, the combat is always satisfying, due to the crunchiness of landing blows, the howls of human foes scorched by your Igni sign, and the fearsome behavior of necrophages, wandering ghosts, and beasts of the indescribable sort. It's easy to get sidetracked and outlevel story quests, but even lesser beasts require a bit of finesse; drowners attack in numbers, for instance, knocking you about and making it difficult to swing, while winged beasts swoop in for a smackdown and require you to blast them down with a flash of fire, a shockwave, or a crossbow bolt.The familiar magical signs return in The Witcher 3. Geralt is no mage, but he still calls on the powers of magic to assist him in combat. Character advancement is substantially improved over the previous games, providing not just passive improvements to your magical trap and your force-push technique, but also altering their very behavior. Casting Igni, for instance, initially produces a brief flash of flames. Certain upgrades, however, allow you to spray a stream of flames for as long as your energy supply supports it. Roasting a crowd of witch hunters in this way is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress. How appropriate that you turn this punishment on the same factions that would rid the world of sorceresses and their cohorts.The Witcher 3 finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe.Loot has a huge role to play in the game, thanks to the high degree of armor and weapon customization. Different armor sets in particular are a joy to uncover, making Geralt look more and more hardened as you progress. In many role-playing games, hunting for treasure is more of a chore to be marked off of the to-do list than a pressing adventure of its own. In The Witcher 3, discovering a diagram of new and improved chest armor is a cause for celebration. Geralt can get a shave and a haircut (and delightfully, his beard grows back over time), but otherwise, you cannot customize his physical appearance; new armor means a new look, and with it, a new visual attitude. Geralt's look evolves from that of a battered soldier, to robed battle wizard, to wisened commander, all on the basis of the game's exquisite armor designs.The Witcher 3 also benefits from its hugely expanded potions system, which allows you to quaff potions during combat--though as always, witcher potions are dangerous, and Geralt can only have so many in effect due to their rising toxicity. Between gear diagrams and potion ingredients, I became a digital hoarder, a trap I typically avoid in role-playing games. Again, it comes down to balance: your inventory fills rapidly, but for the most part, this is not just ""stuff"" for the sake of ""stuff."" I knew that the ingredients I collected would allow me to create a potion that in turn let me dive for treasure without being annoyed by pesky sea-dwelling drowners. I knew that I could break down those horse hides I collected into armor components the local smith needed to make me look even mightier.From one hour to the next, the compulsion to examine the landscape grows. Some of the joys that arise in the wilds are quiet ones: you mount your horse Roach and trot over the hill in time to see a rich sunset, always a treat in The Witcher 3, whose saturated reds and oranges make the sky look as beautiful and as blood-sodden as the meadows beneath them. You discover a boat and embark on an impromptu voyage through the islands of Skellige, taking note of the ship wreckage that mars the beaches and cliffs. The music swells, and a soprano intones a euphoric melody that accentuates the peacefulness. The peacefulness is always broken, however--perhaps by a journey into a dark dungeon where your torch lights the pockmarked walls and a snarling fiend waits to devour you, or by the shout of a boy crying out for your assistance.When it comes to platform differences, the surprises are few, and divergences are a matter of degrees, not orders of magnitude. The original review copy was for the PlayStation 4 release, which sports a higher resolution than the Xbox One’s version, though without a side-by-side comparison, Xbox One owners should have no reason to bemoan the way the game looks: it’s beautiful on all of its platforms.As for the PC version, with rising concern regarding how the game looked at early showings versus how it looks at release, it’s vital to note that The Witcher 3 on PC looks absolutely wonderful, particularly if you have a reasonably powerful machine and can see the game in motion at its highest settings. Software stability is another concern now that The Witcher 3 has hit wide release. I’ve not encountered anything serious in my many hours of play, though the cliched phrase “your mileage may vary” is always an apt one. My time on the PC has been mostly problem-free, and the frame rate there has remained more consistent than on PlayStation 4 and on Xbox One, both of which reveal occasional stutters. All things considered, however, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a fantastic role-playing game on all three of its platforms, and a treat for those that enjoy losing themselves in lush virtual worlds. -The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is undoubtedly beautiful regardless of platform, though prone to occasional bugs and visual glitches. Solving a quest's subtasks in a particular order caused the game to stick at a perpetual loading screen. Roach decided to stop galloping and lurch ahead in a weird way for minutes on end until I quick-traveled away and returned. Geralt's hair blew in the wind, even when he was indoors. It's jarring should you enter an area after quick-traveling and the citizens have yet to pop in, including quest-givers. Along with occasional console frame rate jitters, these elements may prove distracting to you should they arise, depending on your level of tolerance; even so, Geralt's newest adventure is such an achievement that I was rarely disturbed by the glitches I encountered.These distractions stand out in part because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is otherwise incredible and sumptuous; the little quirks are pronounced when they are surrounded by stellar details. And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.Seven years later, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is still a staggering achievement; and thanks to the next-gen update, it’s better than ever. The free update packs in visual enhancements, fresh content, and new features, as well as an extra coat of polish. Whether you’ve played The Witcher 3 or not, it's the perfect time to explore The Northern Realms.While the core experience is unchanged, CD Projekt Red has made a number of thoughtful tweaks and additions that further elevate The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt--the most noticeable one being the visual enhancements. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, The Witcher 3 has two separate graphics modes: Performance and ray tracing. Performance mode renders the game at a constant 60 frames per second, while the ray tracing mode limits the framerate to 30, but features ray-traced lighting.I’ve spent most of my time with the PS5 version in performance mode. Ray tracing mode adds more texture and depth to the world and interiors, but the rock solid frame rate makes performance mode preferable, especially when it comes to combat. Rolling around the battlefield, countering enemies, and casting signs feels smooth and responsive and, thankfully, the performance mode doesn’t come at the expense of resolution, at least as far as I can tell with the naked eye. Both modes utilize a dynamic resolution to ensure smooth presentation, so the only thing missing in performance mode is the ray traced lighting.The ray tracing--while subtle--is still impressive. Interiors are the most noticeably impacted by the new feature. Light sources cast deeper and more realistic shadows onto characters and surfaces to create a warmer, more authentic scene. Outdoors, you can see the effects of it on surfaces, particularly the reflections on puddles and large bodies of water. It’s hard to recommend one setting over the other as both have their advantages and disadvantages. The performance option better suits my playstyle and taste, but if framerate isn’t all that important, then ray tracing might be the way to go.Of course, the PC version offers the best of both worlds, provided you have a capable rig. There are a few more ray-tracing options to play around with as well as an Ultra+ graphics setting. I haven’t been able to test the PC version yet, but I’m eager to see how good this world can look on a state of the art PC.The real showstopper is the new photo mode. While it may not be as robust as contemporary photo modes, it highlights just how gorgeous the world is and accentuates the improved visuals. You can activate photo mode by pressing in both analog sticks any time outside of cutscenes. The camera is snappy and responsive, and lets you tweak the FOV, the tilt, and a number of other visual effects. Unfortunately, you can’t adjust time of day and weather, or alter Geralt’s facial expression and pose. It’s a bummer but the basics are more than enough to capture breathtaking vistas and bloody action.The next-gen version also introduces new alternate camera modes that are tighter on Geralt, giving a more intimate over the shoulder perspective. While this camera may not be as practical as the wider, default camera, it’s impossible for me to go back. The world is so detailed and being just a little closer to the action gives the experience more weight. The environmental storytelling is easier to parse, characters details are more noticeable, and enemies look even more vicious when they are right in your face.Oddly enough, the improved visuals, the new photo mode, and alternate camera angles have changed the way I play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I’ve always appreciated the beauty of that world, but I am moving at a slower more deliberate pace. I am less concerned with the question marks on the map and more interested in exploring the world in front of me, stumbling on side-quests and points of interest naturally. It’s far more satisfying to happen upon a rare set of armor tucked away in a cave than it is to plot a direct path to a cave via the map.This playstyle is further supported thanks to new map filters and HUD settings. If you’d like, you can remove all the exclamation points and question marks off the map and let your curiosity guide you. You can even set it so the mini-map only appears when you activate your Witcher senses. Which, paired with the closer camera angles, gives exploration a cleaner, more cinematic feel.The next-gen update also adds a new side-quest that feels right at home in The Witcher 3. It introduces a couple of characters, and takes place in an under-utilized landmark in Velen. There are a few more surprises, which I won’t spoil, but upon completion you gain access to the Netflix-inspired gear.When CD Projekt Red revealed that they’d be bringing Netflix-inspired gear to The Witcher 3 I was trepidacious. The world of The Witcher 3 is such a well-thought-out and focused experience. The Netflix series, by comparison, is not. I was concerned that this quest and equipment might water down the experience. Fortunately, that isn’t the case. While I still don’t plan on using Cavill’s Witcher gear, the quest itself is a welcome inclusion that gives context to the new gear and how it ended up in CD Projekt Red’s interpretation of this world. Even if you don’t plan on replaying The Witcher 3 from start to finish, I recommend loading up an old save just to check this out. At the very least, it’s worth it to hear Doug Cockle reprise his role to deliver some new lines as the White Wolf.The only major change to the gameplay is quick sign casting. If you have it turned on, you can hold down R2 or right trigger and press one of the face buttons or L2 to quickly cast a sign. It took some getting used to, but it’s now my preferred way of sign casting. It’s nice being able to throw up a Quen right before battle by holding down R2 and pressing circle, and then immediately setting my foes on fire with Igni holding R2 and pressing L2. While it may take some time to build up the muscle memory, this small change does streamline combat quite a bit, especially on harder fights that might have you swapping signs often.Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is an impressive collection of new features, tweaks, and enhancements that make one of the best RPGs in the last decade, even better. If you’ve never played The Witcher 3, consider this a sign to finally give it a shot. If you’ve already played The Witcher 3, there’s still enough here for the experience to feel fresh. -- Jake DekkerUse your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Graphical improvements and new accessibility options — same excellent RPGThe “next-gen” upgrade for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is almost here, and I’ve spent a few days playing through the first few hours of the game (very leisurely) to see what it’s like. I’ve got good news: It is, in fact, a complete Witcher 3 experience with some light quality-of-life improvements and a substantial graphical upgrade. It also still serves as a high-water mark in RPG design, to the extent that it still makes other games look dimmer by comparison.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The update, which I played on PlayStation 5, rests on three major pillars: visual upgrades, several fan mods that have been integrated into the game proper, and some new DLC that integrates aesthetics from Netflix’s The Witcher series into the game. The visual updates offer a performance mode that locks the game at 60 frames per second. They’re good frames, and although I know that PC players have been living in this world for a while, the experience of kicking back on the couch and watching Geralt of Rivia pirouette while cutting Drowners in half can’t be beat. It’s great outside of action, too. Watching Geralt’s facial expressions at 60 fps on a big 4K television is mesmerizing. His characteristic “hrmms” and “uh-huhs,” with their attending slight changes of expression, have always been at the core of his character; there is a cleanness to the game’s lines and movements in performance mode that draws those things out, and makes them all the more stylized, with well-defined edges and a slightly softer palette in between. It also doesn’t hurt that the performance mode never made the fans in my PS5 kick in. By contrast, anytime that Geralt even thought about speaking to townsfolk, or galloping Roach through a monster-infested swamp, on my last-gen playthroughs, it sounded like my PS4 was going to launch into orbit. I wasn’t nearly as impressed with the update’s 30 fps ray tracing mode, however. I’m not sure if it was an interaction with my TV or an actual frame rate issue, but turning the fidelity-focused mode on seemed to introduce an actual stutter. Even weirder, in an early cutscene with the sorceress Yennefer, it seemed to entirely break the audio sync with the character models (pausing the cutscene and switching back to Performance immediately fixed it). I did not leave it on very much, other than to simply see how things looked with the major lighting changes. As I continue my replay of the game on this newer console, I am going to keep it on performance mode, if only because that allows the game to lean into its strengths. Geralt’s world is a world, and the new 4K textures, with their lush greens and churned browns, provide a beautiful backdrop against which Geralt and crew stand out. Whatever light ray tracing is invoked here is just the right amount, without detracting from the movement of it all. Velen was always mostly swamps, but in The Witcher 3’s new 2022 incarnation, the bogs take on an ethereal look — almost like gobs of Vaseline poured across the wilderness. Fantasy Vaseline.Improved graphics, mods that make inventory management and map navigation a little easier, and some throw-in DLC are all good. But I’m not sure that they are the explosively exciting thing about returning to The Witcher 3 in 2022. These are elements that might lure you in for a replay or, if you’re lucky, your first foray into the interlocked worlds of commoners, creatures, immortals, and lords that Geralt weaves through. They’re what gets you in the door, maybe, but they’re not the party.

  The party — by which I mean the massive political and interplanar story that happens within The Witcher 3 — is still incredible, and still manages to make the vast majority of other open-world RPGs (most other games, really) seem lacking by comparison. Take White Orchard as an example. It’s the first area of the game, and it functions as both a catch-up for veterans of the franchise and a tutorial for new players. Geralt and his pseudo-dad Vesemir are trying to meet their old friend Yennefer in the middle of a war zone, and she wasn’t where she told them she would be. They’re on the lookout, and they’re immediately dragged into things that witchers do: There’s a gryphon to hunt and local politics to navigate, and the hunters must find a solution that satisfies both. The White Orchard section of the game takes less than two hours (more quickly, for others), but it is absolutely laden with information about the world and the goals of its characters, big and small. We get to know the nations that are warring. We learn about their policies, and who might gain power if the invaders win. We see inefficiencies and hopes for a better tomorrow, and we see old prejudices remain and new ones emerge. Geralt lives in a place as fleshed out as any game location has ever been, and more than that, he’s weary of it. Through him, we learn how to be weary of it ourselves, and we can be angered by the short-sightedness of its inhabitants. It was astonishing to me how quickly I was absorbed back into this fantasy world after thinking I was done and totally over it, having replayed it for (I thought) the last time a couple of years ago. The upgrades help with this feeling of character alignment and being seated in the fiction — the UI is more unobtrusive now, and there’s a new efficiency to menu-ing that makes the whole thing much quicker to navigate — but that’s not what is going to keep people engaged these next few weeks, or even months. That magic was there the whole time.Oddly enough, the prevailing thought that dogged me as I played The Witcher 3 again was actually about another game. I was thinking about Cyberpunk 2077, which I played earlier this year, and how little it played off the successes of The Witcher 3. A strength of Geralt’s adventure is how little of it really has to do with him. He’s in some important rooms, and he meets movers and shakers, but warriors live and die without him. Dynasties fall. Monsters kill the weak. The mechanisms of life happen, and he doesn’t have to be there to see it all unfold — that’s what makes his tale so compelling. He’s a hero when he’s around, and he’ll move or shake as necessary, but his world is not one driven by a protagonist. It is a humble fantasy, or at least presents itself as one, and by contrast, Cyberpunk 2077 was so self-centered on the part of the player that it seemed like people didn’t exist if they weren’t within my field of view. In that game, history happened so that protagonist V could be there to inherit it. Geralt is almost anonymous by comparison.The next-gen upgrade is going to make that available for more people, and I’m excited for that. But it did leave me with a melancholy feeling about where we’ve been and, given the future of The Witcher franchise, where a post-Cyberpunk Witcher game might go. I hope CD Projekt Red’s 2015 RPG, rather than the one it released in 2020, is the foundation that’s built upon. The next-gen upgrade for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be released Dec. 14 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

The Witcher 3 makes what should have been a terrifying risk look like the most natural evolution in the world.The Witcher and its sequel established a fascinating fantasy world full of politics, intrigue, magic and monsters, and rooted it all in Geralt of Rivia, one of the last of the infamous Witchers — bounty hunters created through a potentially fatal series of trials and alchemical mutations, for hire by anyone with coin to destroy monsters. The Witcher 2 placed this within an action adventure context largely linear in structure, albeit with major plot changes and entirely different second halves based on player decisions made early on.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes the setting and complicated world-building of its predecessor and blows them out with an ambitious but logical next-step: an open-world game. For a studio without the AAA resources of a Bethesda or EA, transitioning from a more conservative linear structure to an undertaking so massive demonstrates a level of confidence bordering on insanity.But CD Projekt Red has pulled it off, and in fact, has built a game that succeeds largely based on how well their previous Witcher work and concepts of player choice translate in an open-world setting, even as The Witcher 3 makes steps back elsewhere.The Witcher 3 opens with Geralt in search of multiple people, namely former love interest Yennifer and his former ward/adopted daughter, Ciri, both of whom appear to be the object of the attentions of the nightmarish Wild Hunt. The story rapidly spirals outward, involving kings and their agents, aligning the political machinations of sorceresses and rulers both with and against Geralt as he seeks to find Ciri and unravel the mystery of her disappearance — and just what the Wild Hunt wants from her.It's worth saying immediately that the characterization and storytelling of The Witcher 3 is considerably better than The Witcher 2. Where that game often felt like a litany of confusing schemes and plots and a list of various power players that the player might never meet or see, The Witcher 3 is much better at introducing its actors smartly and efficiently — even as the cast ballooned in the middle third of the game, I never felt especially lost or confused about the various intrigues in play, of what I was doing, for who, or why.This would be impressive enough in an open-world game with a quarter of the story and characters, and for CD Projekt to keep everything straight and intelligible is a genuine achievement. That achievement is compounded by the seeming effect of player actions and choices on moment to moment events in the game.I don't think there's anything in The Witcher 3 as significant as the Iorveth/Roche moment in The Witcher 2, which dictated an entirely different middle act of that game depending on your decisions, but I did tend to find that my choices in The Witcher 3's major side quests and the things I had done prior to advancing the main plot were reflected in those bigger moments.The Witcher 3's narrative achievements also don't come at the expense of its broader open-world fundamentals. CD Projekt finds the compulsive, satisfying quest-to-quest momentum that makes the best open-world games so hard to put down and so easy to play for marathon sessions. In part, this is because it's interesting to learn more about the world, its history and the various monsters and factions that populate it. There's a great sense of place, of somewhere where things happened before, and even smaller points of interest establish environmental storytelling. More unusually for the genre, and more seemingly difficult to nail, is a feeling of ecology — that the creatures that live in, or at times die in and then haunt the area do so with an organic sense of history.Monster contracts express this best, as each requires a bit of investigation prior to the their inevitable confrontation. Witnesses need to be talked to, evidence gathered, leads followed — and the matter-of-fact nature of these moments as side quests really do sell the idea of Geralt's witchering as his profession, with assignments that seem routine and others that rise to more epic proportions. And CD Projekt's production with sidequests do lend them an air of importance, as each seems to involve a fair amount of decent writing and multiple conversation options that could conceivably open more possible means of resolving the issue at hand.However, as the game goes on, monster contracts, and admittedly, side quests in general start to bleed together. Objectives in the middle third of the game feel more and more like running from one point to another to try to advance dialogue sequences, which is made more frustrating than it needs to be by an overly restrictive fast-travel system. Fast travel can only be activated at signposts, or, while on a boat, to various harbors throughout the world, and signposts can be pretty far apart. The Witcher 3's world is worth exploring without the artificial enforcement of extended runs whether on foot, horseback or boat.These are all new considerations in a Witcher game, really, but some things feel much more familiar. Combat is still dominated by a combination of Geralt's steel and silver swords, used against threats natural and supernatural respectively — bless whoever at CD Projekt decided Geralt would automatically draw the correct sword when combat starts — and the use of signs, a collection of defensive and offensive spells.I think this is where some fans of The Witcher 2 will be most disappointed. Encounters in that game were brutal, and difficult, practically demanding preparation through the use of potions and weapon oils. Combat itself was methodical, with attacks taking stamina and poorly judged swings opening you up for deadly counterattacks from almost any enemy. The Witcher 3 has been greatly simplified. While potions and oils are still present and occasionally necessary, the need for preparation is mostly gone on the default difficulty. Geralt can swing his sword without getting tired, and signs are tied to the same stamina as basic physical actions like dodging.In my experience, this leads to much more active combat than The Witcher 2, and I liked that I could go for greedy kills and attacks and try to end fights quickly. Signs are available for use much more often, and I found myself experimenting with various spells, sometimes relying on them entirely as I leveled my character to take better advantage of them. It all feels reasonably dynamic, especially when you throw potions into the mix (even if I rarely needed anything more than a basic damage buff and some health regeneration). Signs also add some much needed creativity and benefits to character customization — harpies and sirens didn't prove too much of a hassle for me when I could knock them out of the sky with upgraded telekinesis blasts, and I felt cleverer for my choices in that regard.But I'll admit to missing the very visceral sense of impact and heavy give and take that defined Geralt's fighting style before. And The Witcher 3's basic mechanics have some more prominent problems elsewhere. The Witcher 3's camera is often terrible, especially indoors. It's hard to appreciate the beautiful world that CD Projekt built when it aggressively occluded my view of the fight in progress, and Geralt's generally great animations were lost on me when I got stuck on various objects in the world trying to avoid attacks.This problem is even more rage-inducing during timed sequences that frequently feel hamstrung by cumbersome, unintuitive ground traversal that reminded me, in a bad way, of the ""stupid-feet"" problem that has plagued recent Assassin's Creed releases. When I needed Geralt to do something specific quickly, he often failed me in the worst possible way, running against a wall, failing to turn, or otherwise getting tangled up in the world or himself.Meanwhile, the final hours lose the open aspect the game spends so much time cultivating, instead devolving into a series of not-particularly-interesting boss fights that range from laughably easy to unfair in their sharp spikes in difficulty. These are punctuated by even more egregious, strangely distracting jaunts from points A to B to C and so on.But if you're playing the game like a normal person, not a reviewer, it will be weeks, maybe months before you ever make it to the less-inspired end-game. There's an enormous amount of stuff to do, people to meet and talk to, monsters to hunt, treasure to find and craft. And despite the weaker mission design, the story doesn't feel in a hurry to end or resolve. There's a sense of real finality present in The Witcher 3's end-game that its open-world peers often struggle to find.For the advances in technology, writing and basic storytelling chops The Witcher 3 makes, it's a case of more ambiguous momentum elsewhere.The Witcher 3's expanded cast of characters doesn't preclude more screen time for just about everyone, and CD Projekt has done work to make for more interesting, influential women that feel just a bit more fleshed out than they've been previously. This includes a number of powerful women with complicated motivations and goals of their own.That said, the world CD Projekt has created is oppressively misogynist. In some ways, the game deals directly with this — characters acknowledge again and again that it's hard to be a woman there, that it's a place of violence and terror and that women must work harder to be recognized and respected.Then it kills them, over and over. There are several monster types devoted to murdered and wronged women whom Geralt is frequently asked to destroy, and other villainous characters are shown torturing or even butchering women to show just how evil they are. One sequence seemed specifically designed to see how long I could listen to a major female character have her fingernails pulled out before I ended the conversation to attack the individual in question. A later scene shows a villain literally surrounded by the bodies of murdered prostitutes.In another, a character who admitted to beating his wife so badly she miscarried is given an opportunity to explain why she had it coming, complete with a sympathetic conversation response option to go with it. The performances all around in this scene are excellent, the presentation among the best, most reined in anywhere in the game, but the message I saw it conveying was abhorrent.I get that the setting of The Witcher 3 is meant to be a dark, dirty fantasy. But in a world that so explicitly goes out of its way to build a believable, distinctive take on the genre, the inclusion of so much violence explicitly directed against women feels like a clear, disconcerting choice. It's not just present, it's frequently a focus.When they're not being murdered, women in The Witcher 3 are comically sexualized. Nudity is everywhere — think Game of Thrones on HBO — and even when they're dressed, female leads don't have it much better. One character, the subject of an extended series of side quests and whom plays a fairly important role in advancing the story wears a dress with a neckline so wide I was pretty sure I was seeing an areola every time she turned to the side (no, seriously).Other moments are truly worthy of eye-rolling — as when one male character criticizes a woman for going into battle with her shirt hanging open, which is really the snake eating its own tail of video game sexism in a game where a significant portion of its speaking female characters are similarly and impractically exposed. Even Ciri, a daughter figure for Geralt and someone revealed to be incredibly powerful in her own right, walks around with her shirt unbuttoned in the middle, with a pretty clear view of a bra underneath — even when her attire changes to feature a fur-lined collar in colder climates.Also, while I did not by any means see every city, burg and outpost in The Witcher 3's world in my 70+ hours spent within it, I don't recall a single non-white humanoid anywhere — not in Skellige, Novograd, Oxenfurt or anywhere else. Once I realized this I couldn't stop looking for any example of a person of color anywhere, and I never found it, unless you count naked monster women sitting at the feet of a boss like a slightly more awkward tribute to a Frank Frazetta painting. But maybe they're in there, somewhere.
The Witcher 3's subject matter, its almost defiant doubling down on its treatment of women as titillating props for Geralt and the player, even as it tries to flesh out more female leads, is its most disappointing aspect. This constant presence weighs down what would otherwise be an excellent bit of closure for Geralt's video game saga — which isn't helped by the control issues that often detract from sequences meant to break up open-world monotony.
The result is still a game that often feels like a stunningly confident, competent shot across the bow of the open world genre, folding in an incredibly strong narrative and a good sense of consequence to the decisions that present themselves throughout, presenting a fun bit of combat creativity into a genre that desperately needs it. With that going for it, The Witcher 3 is a great game though it isn't a classic — and it can carry a somewhat qualified recommendation.

   on December 13, 2022 at 11:27AM PSTIn The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the sacred is always at war with the profane, and beauty is always at war with blood. The series has always contrasted its world's physical glamor with its intrinsic violence, but never has that contrast been this uneasy, this convulsive. That The Witcher 3 depicts the immediate brutality of battle in great detail is not a surprise; many games fill the screen with decapitated heads and gory entrails. It's the way this incredible adventure portrays the personal tragedies and underhanded opportunities that such battles provide that makes it so extraordinary.It is more than its thematic turbulence that makes The Witcher 3 extraordinary, actually. Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Skellige and in the city of Novigrad, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ReviewAs returning protagonist Geralt of Rivia, you, too, face the anguish of mere existence, sometimes in unexpected, unscripted ways. The central story, which sees you seeking your ward and daughter figure Ciri, as well as contending with the otherworldly force known as the wild hunt, often forces this anguish upon you. But it was my natural exploration of the game's vast expanses that proved most affecting. At one point, I witnessed a woman sentenced to death, doomed to starve after being chained to a rock. It's a chilling sentence, of course, but it was only later, when I accidentally sailed past the tiny island where her corpse still rested, that the horror of her punishment sunk into my heart. The Witcher 3's story did not script this moment; it was merely a passing detail that might have been lost in the waves or overlooked in favor of the harpies circling overhead. Yet there she was, a reminder that my actions--actions that felt righteous and reasonable as I made them--allowed this woman to rot in this faraway place.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings touched on similar repercussions, but The Witcher 3 makes them personal. Political tensions run as hot as they always have in this series, and your decisions still divert the paths of barons and kings in intriguing ways. But where The Witcher 2's focus on plot came at the expense of characterization, the sequel gives the wartime struggle great heft by giving Geralt intimate connections to every major player. The connection between Ciri and Geralt proves to be the story's strongest driving force, but Ciri is not a damsel to be rescued, though it may seem so at first, especially in this particular world. This is a place where women struggle to find respect as political candidates, as armorsmithing masters, and even as proper members of a functioning culture.Roasting a crowd of witch hunters is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress.Women, as it happens, are also this story's strongest force. If you have played a Witcher game before, you know many of them already. The most powerful of them are former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses, few of them outright likable, and each of them defiant in the face of death. In certain circumstances, you take control of Ciri herself, and she wields swords just as capably as a witcher does. (Her phantom dashes also bring a zippiness to her sections that Geralt lacks.) The occasional dose of gratuitous toplessness sometimes proves to be a needle scratch, particularly in a sauna scene that seems to have been constructed specifically to get you up close and personal with a woman's anatomy. In other moments, however, the nudity is a natural element of a scene's sensuality, such as the tutorial scene that features Yennefer and Geralt sharing a relaxed intimacy that surpasses the obvious physical connection.The Witcher 3 is enormous in scope, though ""big"" is just a descriptor, a statement of neither good nor bad. It is fortunate, then, that The Witcher 3 does not subscribe to the ""make a big world and fill it with copy-paste content"" design philosophy. Instead, it finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe. You follow a path not just because there's a question mark on your map, but also because it must lead somewhere new and interesting. The intrigue builds naturally: Every quest is a story of sadness or triumph waiting to absorb you, asking you to make decisions that change the landscape in various ways. You won't always know what the consequences are; some decisions have noticeable, game-altering repercussions, while others barely draw your gaze. But the consequences are there, and you often notice them, even though the game doesn't go out of its way to call attention to them.Of course, story quests, side quests, and monster-killing contracts typically involve the same set of activities: killing, talking, and activating your witcher senses, which reveal footprints and scent trails and turn Geralt into a particularly violent private investigator. It is the details that keep every task as inviting as the one that came before. It might be a change of scenery that turns an otherwise typical contract into a clash for the ages: you pull out your crossbow and shoot a screaming wyvern out of the sky with a well-placed bolt, then plunge your silver sword into its heart, all while a fire rages in the outpost beyond and lightning bolts tear across the dark sky. It might be fear that disrupts your state of mind: you search for spirits as you trudge through a murky swamp, lighting the mist with the green light that emanates from your magical lantern. The Witcher 3 makes grand gestures and small ones, too; you may battle werewolves and match wits with kings and barons, but hearing an angel-voiced trobairitz sing a plaintive ballad is a stunning show-stopper.The writing can be best described as ""lusty."" Many of the land's inhabitants serve a god, but their gods have no apparent problem with them making murderous accusations and shouting obscenities. It's fitting that these people would turn to the gods yet curse them in turn, given fields ravaged by battle and littered with bloated corpses. There are a few moments that reveal the screenplay's seams: some of Geralt's lines may not make sense if you choose them in a particular order, for instance, and Geralt is concerned only with money and prefers to stay out of politics, except for when he's not like that at all, because the plot demands as much. But at least the witcher's signature dry growl remains intact, and the rambunctious Irish and Scottish accents that pervade particular regions may inspire you to head to the pub and grab a pint.As cutting as some characters' wit may be (Sigismund Dijkstra's sarcastic barbs make him one of the game's foul-mouthed delights), you do most of your cutting with the blades sheathed on your back. The Witcher 2's combat was overly demanding at the outset, but The Witcher 3 is substantially easier; I recommend, in fact, that you choose a difficulty level one notch higher than the one you would typically choose, presuming you don't default to the most stringent one straight away. Even when things get easy, however, the combat is always satisfying, due to the crunchiness of landing blows, the howls of human foes scorched by your Igni sign, and the fearsome behavior of necrophages, wandering ghosts, and beasts of the indescribable sort. It's easy to get sidetracked and outlevel story quests, but even lesser beasts require a bit of finesse; drowners attack in numbers, for instance, knocking you about and making it difficult to swing, while winged beasts swoop in for a smackdown and require you to blast them down with a flash of fire, a shockwave, or a crossbow bolt.The familiar magical signs return in The Witcher 3. Geralt is no mage, but he still calls on the powers of magic to assist him in combat. Character advancement is substantially improved over the previous games, providing not just passive improvements to your magical trap and your force-push technique, but also altering their very behavior. Casting Igni, for instance, initially produces a brief flash of flames. Certain upgrades, however, allow you to spray a stream of flames for as long as your energy supply supports it. Roasting a crowd of witch hunters in this way is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress. How appropriate that you turn this punishment on the same factions that would rid the world of sorceresses and their cohorts.The Witcher 3 finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe.Loot has a huge role to play in the game, thanks to the high degree of armor and weapon customization. Different armor sets in particular are a joy to uncover, making Geralt look more and more hardened as you progress. In many role-playing games, hunting for treasure is more of a chore to be marked off of the to-do list than a pressing adventure of its own. In The Witcher 3, discovering a diagram of new and improved chest armor is a cause for celebration. Geralt can get a shave and a haircut (and delightfully, his beard grows back over time), but otherwise, you cannot customize his physical appearance; new armor means a new look, and with it, a new visual attitude. Geralt's look evolves from that of a battered soldier, to robed battle wizard, to wisened commander, all on the basis of the game's exquisite armor designs.The Witcher 3 also benefits from its hugely expanded potions system, which allows you to quaff potions during combat--though as always, witcher potions are dangerous, and Geralt can only have so many in effect due to their rising toxicity. Between gear diagrams and potion ingredients, I became a digital hoarder, a trap I typically avoid in role-playing games. Again, it comes down to balance: your inventory fills rapidly, but for the most part, this is not just ""stuff"" for the sake of ""stuff."" I knew that the ingredients I collected would allow me to create a potion that in turn let me dive for treasure without being annoyed by pesky sea-dwelling drowners. I knew that I could break down those horse hides I collected into armor components the local smith needed to make me look even mightier.From one hour to the next, the compulsion to examine the landscape grows. Some of the joys that arise in the wilds are quiet ones: you mount your horse Roach and trot over the hill in time to see a rich sunset, always a treat in The Witcher 3, whose saturated reds and oranges make the sky look as beautiful and as blood-sodden as the meadows beneath them. You discover a boat and embark on an impromptu voyage through the islands of Skellige, taking note of the ship wreckage that mars the beaches and cliffs. The music swells, and a soprano intones a euphoric melody that accentuates the peacefulness. The peacefulness is always broken, however--perhaps by a journey into a dark dungeon where your torch lights the pockmarked walls and a snarling fiend waits to devour you, or by the shout of a boy crying out for your assistance.When it comes to platform differences, the surprises are few, and divergences are a matter of degrees, not orders of magnitude. The original review copy was for the PlayStation 4 release, which sports a higher resolution than the Xbox One’s version, though without a side-by-side comparison, Xbox One owners should have no reason to bemoan the way the game looks: it’s beautiful on all of its platforms.As for the PC version, with rising concern regarding how the game looked at early showings versus how it looks at release, it’s vital to note that The Witcher 3 on PC looks absolutely wonderful, particularly if you have a reasonably powerful machine and can see the game in motion at its highest settings. Software stability is another concern now that The Witcher 3 has hit wide release. I’ve not encountered anything serious in my many hours of play, though the cliched phrase “your mileage may vary” is always an apt one. My time on the PC has been mostly problem-free, and the frame rate there has remained more consistent than on PlayStation 4 and on Xbox One, both of which reveal occasional stutters. All things considered, however, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a fantastic role-playing game on all three of its platforms, and a treat for those that enjoy losing themselves in lush virtual worlds. -The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is undoubtedly beautiful regardless of platform, though prone to occasional bugs and visual glitches. Solving a quest's subtasks in a particular order caused the game to stick at a perpetual loading screen. Roach decided to stop galloping and lurch ahead in a weird way for minutes on end until I quick-traveled away and returned. Geralt's hair blew in the wind, even when he was indoors. It's jarring should you enter an area after quick-traveling and the citizens have yet to pop in, including quest-givers. Along with occasional console frame rate jitters, these elements may prove distracting to you should they arise, depending on your level of tolerance; even so, Geralt's newest adventure is such an achievement that I was rarely disturbed by the glitches I encountered.These distractions stand out in part because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is otherwise incredible and sumptuous; the little quirks are pronounced when they are surrounded by stellar details. And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.Seven years later, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is still a staggering achievement; and thanks to the next-gen update, it’s better than ever. The free update packs in visual enhancements, fresh content, and new features, as well as an extra coat of polish. Whether you’ve played The Witcher 3 or not, it's the perfect time to explore The Northern Realms.While the core experience is unchanged, CD Projekt Red has made a number of thoughtful tweaks and additions that further elevate The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt--the most noticeable one being the visual enhancements. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, The Witcher 3 has two separate graphics modes: Performance and ray tracing. Performance mode renders the game at a constant 60 frames per second, while the ray tracing mode limits the framerate to 30, but features ray-traced lighting.I’ve spent most of my time with the PS5 version in performance mode. Ray tracing mode adds more texture and depth to the world and interiors, but the rock solid frame rate makes performance mode preferable, especially when it comes to combat. Rolling around the battlefield, countering enemies, and casting signs feels smooth and responsive and, thankfully, the performance mode doesn’t come at the expense of resolution, at least as far as I can tell with the naked eye. Both modes utilize a dynamic resolution to ensure smooth presentation, so the only thing missing in performance mode is the ray traced lighting.The ray tracing--while subtle--is still impressive. Interiors are the most noticeably impacted by the new feature. Light sources cast deeper and more realistic shadows onto characters and surfaces to create a warmer, more authentic scene. Outdoors, you can see the effects of it on surfaces, particularly the reflections on puddles and large bodies of water. It’s hard to recommend one setting over the other as both have their advantages and disadvantages. The performance option better suits my playstyle and taste, but if framerate isn’t all that important, then ray tracing might be the way to go.Of course, the PC version offers the best of both worlds, provided you have a capable rig. There are a few more ray-tracing options to play around with as well as an Ultra+ graphics setting. I haven’t been able to test the PC version yet, but I’m eager to see how good this world can look on a state of the art PC.The real showstopper is the new photo mode. While it may not be as robust as contemporary photo modes, it highlights just how gorgeous the world is and accentuates the improved visuals. You can activate photo mode by pressing in both analog sticks any time outside of cutscenes. The camera is snappy and responsive, and lets you tweak the FOV, the tilt, and a number of other visual effects. Unfortunately, you can’t adjust time of day and weather, or alter Geralt’s facial expression and pose. It’s a bummer but the basics are more than enough to capture breathtaking vistas and bloody action.The next-gen version also introduces new alternate camera modes that are tighter on Geralt, giving a more intimate over the shoulder perspective. While this camera may not be as practical as the wider, default camera, it’s impossible for me to go back. The world is so detailed and being just a little closer to the action gives the experience more weight. The environmental storytelling is easier to parse, characters details are more noticeable, and enemies look even more vicious when they are right in your face.Oddly enough, the improved visuals, the new photo mode, and alternate camera angles have changed the way I play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I’ve always appreciated the beauty of that world, but I am moving at a slower more deliberate pace. I am less concerned with the question marks on the map and more interested in exploring the world in front of me, stumbling on side-quests and points of interest naturally. It’s far more satisfying to happen upon a rare set of armor tucked away in a cave than it is to plot a direct path to a cave via the map.This playstyle is further supported thanks to new map filters and HUD settings. If you’d like, you can remove all the exclamation points and question marks off the map and let your curiosity guide you. You can even set it so the mini-map only appears when you activate your Witcher senses. Which, paired with the closer camera angles, gives exploration a cleaner, more cinematic feel.The next-gen update also adds a new side-quest that feels right at home in The Witcher 3. It introduces a couple of characters, and takes place in an under-utilized landmark in Velen. There are a few more surprises, which I won’t spoil, but upon completion you gain access to the Netflix-inspired gear.When CD Projekt Red revealed that they’d be bringing Netflix-inspired gear to The Witcher 3 I was trepidacious. The world of The Witcher 3 is such a well-thought-out and focused experience. The Netflix series, by comparison, is not. I was concerned that this quest and equipment might water down the experience. Fortunately, that isn’t the case. While I still don’t plan on using Cavill’s Witcher gear, the quest itself is a welcome inclusion that gives context to the new gear and how it ended up in CD Projekt Red’s interpretation of this world. Even if you don’t plan on replaying The Witcher 3 from start to finish, I recommend loading up an old save just to check this out. At the very least, it’s worth it to hear Doug Cockle reprise his role to deliver some new lines as the White Wolf.The only major change to the gameplay is quick sign casting. If you have it turned on, you can hold down R2 or right trigger and press one of the face buttons or L2 to quickly cast a sign. It took some getting used to, but it’s now my preferred way of sign casting. It’s nice being able to throw up a Quen right before battle by holding down R2 and pressing circle, and then immediately setting my foes on fire with Igni holding R2 and pressing L2. While it may take some time to build up the muscle memory, this small change does streamline combat quite a bit, especially on harder fights that might have you swapping signs often.Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is an impressive collection of new features, tweaks, and enhancements that make one of the best RPGs in the last decade, even better. If you’ve never played The Witcher 3, consider this a sign to finally give it a shot. If you’ve already played The Witcher 3, there’s still enough here for the experience to feel fresh. -- Jake DekkerUse your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"Looking back over my last 60 hours with The Witcher 3, I feel a bit like its wandering protagonist: A very attractive man standing alone on a hilltop, looking out over a vast kingdom, unsure where to begin.Just kidding; I look like garbage right now. I’ve spent the last week and a half mostly shut in my apartment, blinds drawn, headphones on, eating potato chips and staring at my television. Over something like five dozen hours, I’ve killed countless monsters, saved scores of villagers, shagged a sorceress or two, and finally watched the credits roll. I’ve seen a fair chunk of The Witcher 3, but I’ve also left a substantial amount of it unexplored.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an open-world role-playing game that casts you as a legendary and sexy monster hunter named Geralt of Rivia. You spend most of the game guiding Geralt as he explores a collection of massive open outdoor areas, taking on quests, slaying monsters, talking with people, making difficult moral choices, and gradually leveling up his gear and abilities. Basically, doing the whole RPG thing.Let’s start by getting my recommendation out of the way. Should you play this game?The Witcher 3 is a wholesale improvement over the already-good Witcher 2, combining the free-roaming exploration of Red Dead Redemption with the complex branching storytelling of a Dragon Age and the tightly designed melee combat of a Monster Hunter or a Dark Souls. It doesn’t always execute those things as well as the games from which it draws inspiration, but thanks to some sharp writing, smart design, and marvelous technical wizardry, Wild Hunt is engrossing despite—and even occasionally thanks to—its many familiar elements.Wild Hunt was developed by Polish video game studio CD Projekt Red. Like the first two Witcher games, it’s based on the works of Polish fantasy author Andrzej Sapkowski, though it uses his books as a springboard for its own tale, rather than directly adapting them. Think of it as fairly standard dark fantasy mixed with a healthy dose of grim Eastern European fairy tale. There are dragons and mages and elves and dwarves, right along with witches who lure children into the wilds and mischievous grubkins who haunt houses and torment people’s dreams.The resulting milieu has a dash more personality than your average fantasy video game—there’s a reason the Polish Prime Minister gave President Obama a copy of the second Witcher game as a gift. If gaming’s fantasy genre at times resembles a collection of chain restaurants, The Witcher is an unexpected serving of local cuisine.Geralt is a Witcher, one of a now-defunct line of genetically-mutated warriors originally created to hunt and kill the beasts that infest the world. (The world, in this case, is known simply as “The Continent.”) At the start of the game, a great southern empire called Nilfgaard is steamrolling its way northward, conquering or killing everyone in their path. The conflict mostly serves as the backdrop for a more personal story, as the Nilfgaardian emperor summons Geralt and charges him with tracking down a young woman named Ciri—née Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon—the emperor’s daughter and heir. Ciri was last seen somewhere beyond the Nilfgaardian lines, in the Northern Kingdoms that continue to fight for independence.Geralt’s task is immediately complicated by several factors: 1) That Ciri possesses some immense but little-understood cosmic power; 2) that for reasons unknown, Ciri is being pursued by an unstoppable interdimensional attack squad known as The Wild Hunt; 3) that the sorceress the emperor has enlisted to aid Geralt in his quest is Geralt’s own lost love Yennefer; and most of all 4) that Geralt raised and trained Ciri himself, and thinks of her as his own adopted daughter.From there, Wild Hunt races outward toward all points of the compass. The resulting tale is remarkably dense and far-reaching, sweeping up dozens of characters across several warring nations, all while straining admirably to resolve numerous lingering plot threads from the first two Witcher games while maintaining focus on the father and daughter at its emotional core. No story could accomplish so much with perfect grace, but I was surprised by how close Wild Hunt came, and how often.Despite its grand scope and substantial cast of characters, Wild Hunt is a lonesome game. Geralt is an aging member of a dying race; he’s an outcast from society and a warrior without a master. In this, he embodies the complementary and familiar archetypes of the wandering ronin of Japanese fiction and the lone gunslinger of wild west cinema.Wild Hunt’s geographical size is impressive on its own—this game is much larger than previous bragging-rights-holders like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V, and it feels it. That immense size doesn’t just exist for its own sake; it serves an important function in the game’s overall design and effect. Wild Hunt conjures the illusion of an actual kingdom full of actual villages populated by actual people, and through sheer size effectively conveys the feeling of wandering an endless wilderness.Each of the game’s many small villages offers something new; a man will flag you down, asking for help dealing with a beast that’s been killing his livestock. Or maybe a merchant’s wagon will have gone missing and she’ll offer Geralt some coin to track it down. Perhaps one village will have a message board covered with notes left by the villagers: Please stop stealing milk from my cows; has anyone seen my lost hat; can someone help out with the bog wraith that keeps killing people? The villages all start to blend together, effectively conveying the feeling of a war-torn kingdom full of shitty little villages populated with desperate people.Through all of that, Geralt rides alone. He enters each new village or encampment atop his horse, and every time, the moment feels iconic. Here is the lone swordfighter, the mysterious stranger, coming to bring justice. Witchers are reviled by most common folk, viewed as mutated abominations. Passersby will spit on you as you pass or call you names once your back is turned. Over time, those you have helped will call out to you as well—you may pass through a village and hear someone thanking you again for your help—but by and large, the message is clear: These people do not love you. They may need your help, but they do not want it. You will never belong.I’ve always liked Geralt of Rivia. I never finished the first Witcher game, but I’ve played its terrific (if flawed) sequel a number of times, and I’m charmed by the taciturn monster-hunter in the title. On paper, Geralt is a mishmash of every male empowerment archetype you can imagine. He’s part Jedi, part Batman, part Kwai Chang Caine, part Don Juan, and part Solid Snake. He has eyes like a cat and awesome white hair. He is both the greatest swordsman and the ablest lover to walk the earth.Yet thanks to some spry, consistent writing and a fine voice-over performance by actor Doug Cockle, Geralt feels like a consistently believable, three-dimensional person. Geralt helps The Witcher games stand apart from role-playing games that let you create and customize your own character, picking your race, gender, backstory, and disposition. Here, you’re playing as Geralt of Rivia. You may help choose which decisions he makes, but he remains his own man.Because Wild Hunt’s story is a culmination of two previous games and a whole collection of short stories and novels, it can be dense and difficult to follow. Game of Thrones’ recent popularity has given the general public a higher threshold for complex, politically driven fantasy narratives, but Wild Hunt feels like hopping into the middle of Storm of Swords without any preamble or hand-holding. I’m familiar with Witcher lore, but I often found myself saying, “Wait, who?” before pausing the game and referring to in-game character descriptions to catch up with what the hell was going on.It can feel as though Wild Hunt requires the player to maintain a cheat-sheet just to keep a handle on who’s who. To wit: There is a character named Ermion and another character named Eredin, joined by yet another character named Emhyr. All three are major players who are important to the narrative, and Geralt and his friends often refer to more than one of them in a single sentence. While it would be easy for characters to refer to Emhyr as “Emperor Emhyr,” which would greatly help clarify things, he’s frequently just referred to as “Emhyr.”Although Wild Hunt’s narrative complexity should be a consideration for anyone thinking about playing it, I’m reluctant to say it’s all that much of a problem. It’s a demanding tale, but often a rich and satisfying one, full of interesting characters and some well-written, surprising dialogue.It helps that the names in this game are incredible:At one point in the story, Yennefer gives Geralt a device called a Potestaquisitor. Say it out loud: “Poh-tes-ta-quiz-itor.” Not only is that maybe the best name for a magical device I’ve ever heard, it also leads to this outstanding conversation:Monster-killing badass though he may be, Geralt is rarely the person in the room with the most power. He spends his time consorting with emperors and kings and sorceresses, and is only ever truly in command of himself. Therefore the player’s choices are usually small-scale and personal, yet another way Wild Hunt differentiates itself from other similar RPGs like Dragon Age and Skyrim. This is not the story of the mighty army commander or the mystical chosen one; it’s the story of the guy who works for the army commander, the guy who knows the mystical chosen one.Characters don’t always do what Geralt suggests, meaning that your decisions don’t impact the story in the ways you might expect. For example: A character is considering doing something rash. You’re given the choice to tell her to go for it or to tell her it’s a bad idea. If you say it’s a bad idea, she might brush you off and go for it anyway, but your lack of support in that moment could be an issue down the road. Or, she might decide not to do it on your advice, and change the narrative in a more obvious way.That makes it much easier to play Wild Hunt naturally, without worrying about your decisions. Will this decision have an impact down the road? Who knows! Might as well just keep playing and find out.Eventually, all of your decisions do lead to one of a number of different endings. When the final foe is defeated, Wild Hunt thankfully doesn’t fall into the trap so many other open-ended RPGs do, ending on a vague non-resolution and dumping you back out in the world to mop up unfinished sidequests. Instead, Geralt and Ciri’s story has an honest to goodness ending, and it happened to be an ending that I found unexpectedly affecting and satisfying. Of course, that was just my ending; your ending might be depressing and awful. It’s possible to go roam around and complete unfinished sidequests after the story is complete, but it’s not supported by the narrative—you’re simply warped back in time to before you began the final mission.For its first half, Wild Hunt is less a tale of high adventure and more of a mystery. Geralt and his allies are tracking Ciri’s path through a war-torn no-man’s-land called Velen and onward to the neighboring Skellige Islands, hunting down witnesses who may have seen her passing and questioning the men and women with whom she fought or sought shelter.In fact, Wild Hunt is mostly a game about solving mysteries. Most of Geralt’s optional monster contracts and other sidequests—of which there are loads, and of which I’ve played but a fraction—involve a mystery of some sort. What kind of monster is making off with children in the night? Was it a beast that killed that merchant’s assistant, or was it the merchant himself? Who’s stealing food from the town taverns? For the most part, these mysteries don’t actually require any input on the part of the player—you don’t get to assemble the clues and figure things out for yourself—but it’s still a lot of fun to guide Geralt as he uncovers clues and cuts closer and closer to the truth.Each step along the main questline brings Geralt closer to Ciri but also brings with it new complications. That rhythm makes up the bulk of the main story missions in the game’s first half. Geralt finds a warlord in Velen who sheltered Ciri for a time, but before he’ll tell Geralt what he knows, he needs Geralt to help him with a few more domestic issues.That formula lends the game its structure in the early goings—Geralt will find a lead, but before that lead bears fruit, he must solve a series of problems and usually, slay a series of monsters. It’s contrived but effective, particularly in the payoff at the end of each quest: When a character finally gives Geralt a further tale of Ciri’s exploits, it’s told through a playable flashback where players are actually given control of her.Ciri’s playable sections are self-contained and brief, but they’re numerous and effective. By letting us see the world through her eyes, even briefly, Wild Hunt gives us more insight into Ciri’s character than if she were simply the object of other characters’ remembrances.She’s also just a lot of fun to control—she was trained as a Witcher and has a few unique magical abilities, in particular an ability to teleport around the battlefield and catch foes unaware. Ciri’s a formidable swordswoman, and a nice change of pace from her slower-moving, more methodical adoptive father.[Spoilers] I was expecting that Geralt would track Ciri for the bulk of the story, and that when he finally found her, the story would enter its endgame and begin to wrap up. So I was pleasantly surprised that Geralt actually reconnects with Ciri at the story’s halfway point. Their reunion simply shifts the story from mystery to full-on adventure, as they unite with the rest of their friends to directly confront their mysterious adversaries in the Wild Hunt. This narrative pivot gives the game even more space to make Ciri an actual character, rather than an ever-out-of-reach objective fueling Geralt’s quest.Players can’t take control of Ciri at will, but once Geralt and Ciri are reunited, the dual-perspectives trick is used to nifty effect during a couple of climactic showdowns. The story lets us see key events through Ciri’s eyes, rather than Geralt’s, and through it all, Geralt and Ciri are given space to explore their familial bond. Some of the best dialogue choices revolve around how best to support Ciri while also trying to teach her the lessons she’ll need to survive. Are you gruff, or permissive? Do you try to protect her, or let her choose to take risks? Many of your interactions with her depend on your understanding of both her character and of Geralt’s, and their interplay is often fascinating. The Daddening of Games continues! [End Spoilers]“Wild Hunt” is actually a pretty good subtitle for The Witcher 3, but it could just as easily have been called The Witcher 3: Hello Ladies. There are more beautiful women in this game than you could shake an enchanted tree branch at, and you sure can have sex with some of them. (Indeed, you can even do it while sitting astride a stuffed unicorn.)The Witcher series has always been unabashedly sexy; as you meet people aware of Geralt’s legend, it becomes clear that he’s as well known for banging sorceresses as he is for slaying monsters.There’s an element of sexual fantasy stitched right into Witcher lore: Because of the nature of their mutations, Witchers are sterile. STDs don’t appear to be much of a thing in this world, which basically makes Geralt a big walking dick, all pleasure and zero risk. Furthermore, Sorceresses are also sterile, and in the course of their magical training learn to make themselves unnaturally beautiful. When Witchers and Sorceresses get together, it’s a recipe for wild, no-strings-attached sexytimes. That contributes to the game’s playful view of sex, at least as it applies to Geralt and his potential consorts. The sex scenes I saw as I played were often goofy and ridiculous, but sex often is goofy and ridiculous. Sex just isn’t that big a deal here, and it’s refreshing.Women and the relations between women and men both play a large role in the Witcher universe, and like many other popular fantasy series, the series does both well and poorly by its female characters. Here again we have a fantasy world where the shittier aspects of our own—sex-slavery, rape, domestic abuse, systemic brutalization of women and minorities—are alive and well, where imaginary castles and kingdoms come with all the bloody baggage of the actual middle ages. Men are subjected to torture and brutality as well, but as it tends to go with these things, women are singled out for sexual violation. A low point comes midway through the story when Geralt comes upon a scene of profound fucked-upedness, a group of women who have been sexually brutalized and murdered seemingly purely as a means of motivating players to kill the man responsible. (Probably would’ve wanted to kill him without seeing a dead prostitute nailed to the wall, thanks.)However, many of the story’s most interesting characters are women, and more than just being powerful and capable, they’re complicated, difficult people with distinct and often conflicting motivations. (It’s just that they look like Victoria’s Secret models and happen to favor skintight riding pants.) Wild Hunt also occasionally surprised me with its willingness to actually say something about oppression, rather than simply depicting it. At one point I had Geralt chase off a couple of men who were harassing a frightened elf on the street. Rather than thanking him, she angrily accused Geralt of intervening just so that he could feel like a hero. This solves nothing, she said. Those men will be back tomorrow, but where will you be?Ciri is at once chaste and comely, a daughter figure and eye candy, which, yes, is awkward. She’s given a rushed romantic subplot but robbed of the chance to consummate it; she’s a strong fighter and arguably more deadly than Geralt with a blade, but she spends the entire game with the center button of her blouse undone and her bra showing. Wild Hunt, then, is somewhat like Geralt—surrounded by powerful, complicated women, enthusiastic but not always sure of how best to proceed.Most of the thrusting Geralt does over the course of Wild Hunt is done with one of the two swords he wears on his back. (How’s that for a transition, eh?) Geralt is one of the most renowned swordsmen alive, and the majority of the game’s quests culminate with him pulling steel and stabbing something until it stops moving.Wild Hunt’s combat is a significant improvement over The Witcher 2. It finally feels as though the PC-focused CD Projekt Red has warmed to controller-based combat, and the majority of the game’s controls sit happily beneath the player’s fingers. The left trigger puts Geralt into a guarded posture, ready to ward off most regular attacks. Players are given two buttons for dodging; a short dodge that doesn’t drain any stamina and a longer roll that does. Attacks involve stringing together various combinations of heavy and light thrusts. Geralt and his foes are animation-locked a la Monster Hunter and the Souls games, meaning combat is as much about careful timing and tactical position as it is about aggressive offense.Geralt has a variety of offensive and defensive abilities aside from his swords. He can cast signs, a low-grade kind of Witcher magic that lets him blast gusts of air or fire at foes, conjure a protective shield around himself, or crawl inside the minds of his human opponents and leave them defenseless. Geralt can also craft any of a number of explosive bombs and is equipped with a nifty crossbow that comes in mighty handy when taking on flocks of airborne beasts.Those skills can be mixed and matched, as well. You could craft a bomb that dispenses a cloud of explosive dust, then ignite it with a fire sign and watch your enemy burn… or ignite it with an explosive bolt from Geralt’s crossbow. You could throw a powder that binds a spectral foe in its corporeal form or cast a sign that lays a mystical trap to accomplish the same goal.Understanding one’s enemies is important, which makes the preliminary, detective-like investigation of each individual monster more than just a roadblock between you and the inevitable showdown. It’s crucial that Geralt understand what he’s going up against in advance, so that he can brew the appropriate potions, equip the appropriate weapons, and apply the appropriate oils to his blade. You can’t change Geralt’s loadout in the middle of combat, a smart restriction that forces players to think like a Witcher and take their enemy’s strengths and weaknesses into account ahead of time.Geralt’s combat animations are remarkably detailed and fluid, and they have a tangible impact on the way the game plays. I regularly felt as though I was in control of an intelligent fighter and was impressed by how smoothly Geralt shifted his posture and focus to move between enemies, even on a crowded battlefield. Part of The Witcher’s appeal is the promise to let you feel like a wily, unstoppable badass, and Geralt’s elegant move-set and expanded arsenal accomplish that goal far more ably than previous games in the series.Some of my favorite fights in the game involved one-on-one matchups against armed, human-shaped opponents, but the game’s many beasts can be a fun challenge, too. I particularly enjoyed taking on various breeds of flying monster—Geralt carefully watches winged beasts circle and dive, leaping just out of reach of their claws and cutting them down before they can escape.Wild Hunt is more enjoyable on higher difficulty settings—on its default “normal” setting, Geralt quickly becomes overleveled and endgame fights can become trivial. Furthermore, he can slice through most enemies without using any of his spells, potions, oils or bombs, which makes things feel much less strategic and rewarding.While higher difficulties force you to keep on your toes and rely more heavily on Geralt’s bag of tricks, they also reveal shortcomings in the enemies’ artificial intelligence. Most bosses simply spam the same two or three attacks, meaning that fights against them feel like fights against predictable video game bosses, rather than contests against unpredictable, intelligent foes. While the higher difficulty does make those fights more challenging and therefore more rewarding, it can also draw out certain encounters, turning them into battles of attrition as Geralt executes the same dodge and counterattack over and over, gradually chipping down the boss’ health.Combat is also occasionally where the game’s technical performance becomes an issue, or at least that was the case during my playthrough. I played a “debug” copy of The Witcher 3 on a special PlayStation 4 that Sony loaned me, meaning that I was essentially playing a final version of the game, minus a day-one patch that the developers are already promising. The game runs well for the most part, holding to what felt like a decent unlocked 30-ish frames per second with the occasional dip.In combat, however, things can get jerkier, particularly when a bunch of characters are fighting on screen at once. When the shit really starts to hit the fan toward the end of the game, the developers’ technological ambitions finally overwhelm the PS4’s capabilities, and the frame-rate and responsiveness become a real problem. This only happened to me a few times, but it did detract. When the frame-rate begins to fluctuate, it becomes harder to feel as connected to Geralt’s movements, which can obviously be a problem in tougher encounters. I’ve yet to play the PC version of Wild Hunt, which will likely benefit from a steadier, higher frame-rate.I’m also hopeful that the PC interface will improve inventory management, which is a real mess in the console version. As you make your way through Wild Hunt, Geralt will accumulate more quests, sidequests, crafting items, herbs, books, notes, monster parts, and upgrade materials than any reasonable human being could know what to do with. So it’s a problem that Wild Hunt’s menus are so convoluted and unwieldy—it takes ages to scroll through your inventory to find whatever object may be necessary for a given task, particularly if you’re in the habit of hoovering up every book and magical item you come across.By the end of the game, the “usable items” tab of my inventory looked like this:Which book is which? No clue. I’d have to scroll through each one in order to find the book I’m looking for. New items are temporarily bumped to the top of the pile, but if you want to find something you’ve already read… well, good luck. It’s equally befuddling that books fit into the same “usable items” category as potions and tonics.Stores are difficult to navigate, too, and the fuller my inventory got, the more the menus would lag as I’d flip between them. I imagine everything is much easier to deal with when using a mouse and a keyboard, but given how well the rest of the game works with a controller, even that feels like a half-solution.This may seem like a small thing to harp on, but given how much of the game is spent navigating various menus, it really isn’t. Game developers, hear my plea! Someone needs to come up with a better way for players to interact with complicated character- and inventory-management systems. I don’t know quite what the solution looks like—a second screen? radial menus?—but it sure ain’t this.At one point partway through the story, I found myself wandering an estate to the far east of one of Wild Hunt’s large northern cities. I had just attended a posh afternoon horse-race, and was in no rush to get anywhere.As I strolled along, I found this guy:That’s a peasant working in a field, shoveling dirt. I stopped and watched him, noticing that after plunging his shovel into the digital “ground” at his feet, he was actually coming up with some dirt. He’d then swing the shovelful of dirt over to his side and dump it out.I couldn’t help but marvel at the amount of work that must have gone into that one small detail. Someone had to animate the peasant, of course, but someone also had to create the dirt. They had to make it its own independent object, to give it weight and assign it the physical properties necessary for it to fly off of the shovel just so.Wild Hunt is laced throughout with that sort of minor technological revelation. At first glance, it may not look all that much more advanced than other similar games we’ve played before. Spend an hour or two playing, however, and its many small bits of programming chutzpah have a cumulative effect.This world doesn’t just look lovely in still images; it moves. A gust of wind tosses the branches of a nearby copse of trees; Geralt’s hair flutters along with it. Characters’ jewelry and armor swing lazily as they walk; their sheathed swords and weapons bob to and fro along with their strides. A nighttime bonfire spits orange light, setting the trees’ shadows dancing against the darkness.Wild Hunt’s developers have used their considerable technological prowess to create a beautiful tribute to the natural world. The sun in this game has moods; its light casts down in a variety of flavors depending on the time and the weather. Humans innately understand that the sun has a slightly different shine at different times of the day, but most digitally-generated sunlight maintains only a few hues and temperatures. Thanks to some no-doubt complicated lighting technology, The Witcher 3 recreates the sun’s light with at-times awe-inspiring results. Rare is the video game that can effectively capture, say, the peculiar tint of the sun as it shines through gathering storm clouds in the late afternoon at a far-north latitude.While Wild Hunt represents one of the most effective attempts yet at digitally re-creating a photorealistic world, each impressive technological feat also necessarily reveals a shortcoming. Characters emote more believably than in similar role-playing games, but their faces still often resemble doll-masks, rigged up to register emotion on cue. Some cutscenes may be rendered with natural motion-capture and impressive fidelity, while others are stilted and robotic. A forest tableau may look beautiful one moment, only to be marred by a strange, hitching herd of deer stumbling their way across it.In other words, even The Witcher 3’s most exciting technological advancements are like any other technological achievement—they’re worthy of celebration on their own, but they’re waypoints along a path toward some as-yet-unreached destination. Inevitably, they will be surpassed.Consider the peasant: He may have dirt in his shovel, but he’s not actually digging a ditch. In some imaginary game released five years from now, that dirt will actually move from the ground into a pile behind him. In five more years, he’ll finish digging and move on to the next row.For now, though: How cool is it that this guy is actually shoveling dirt?!?As time passes in Wild Hunt, Geralt’s beard grows. You can get a shave at any of the game’s major cities, but as the days and weeks progress, his beard starts to grow back.The journey from this……to this……to this…...to this...…occurs across what seems like ten different steps, with Geralt becoming beardier and beardier with each passing day. It’s yet another remarkable technical achievement in a game full of them.Like a lot of Wild Hunt’s best tricks, Geralt’s ever-growing beard connected me to the game in a subtle but potent way. His beard wouldn’t grow in overnight; it would take just long enough that by the time it had fully grown in, I’d reflect on whatever it was we were doing the last time he got a shave. Time is passing, the game was reminding me. Slowly, but surely.“Something Ends, Something Begins.” That’s the title of one of Witcher creator Sapkowski’s later short stories and a concept that plays an important role in Wild Hunt. This game is an ending and a beginning. It’s an ending for Geralt, but, in his protege Ciri, he sees hope for a new beginning. It’s the end of CD Projekt Red’s stewardship of Geralt’s story, yet it feels like a beginning for them as well, as they’ve finally achieved many of the narrative and design ambitions that previously seemed just out of their reach.Wild Hunt is a grand adventure that feels distinctly of its time. It manages to set new standards for video game technology while accentuating the fleeting nature of technological achievement as an end unto itself. It is a worthy exploration of friendship and family, mixing scenes of great sorrow with scenes of ridiculous lustiness, tempering its melancholy with bright splashes of joy and merry monster guts. Come for the epic showdown between good and evil; stay for the unicorn sex."

Destructoid,"darkI have an odd history with The Witcher series. I absolutely fell in love with the first game near launch, at the behest of a friend, and adored the way it approached morality. Typically, games of that era would offer up black and white options, which I felt was a lazy way to incorporate the concept of karma into a game.There’s one quest in particular in the original Witcher that involves someone accused of wrongdoing, and you have the option to help her or turn her in based on the evidence — the game never really tells you what happened, nor does it tell you that you were “right” or “wrong.”While The Witcher 2 did a good job of bringing the series into the modern era gameplay-wise, it was a step back in many respects. The quests weren’t as emotionally packed, and the narrative felt detached — like you were a generic action hero as opposed to an actual Witcher.Thankfully, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt brings back a lot of the personality found in the original, along with a lot of the magic that made the series so special in the first place.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: CD Projekt REDPublisher: Bandai Namco (Europe), WB Games (NA), Spike Chunsoft (Japan)Released: May 19, 2015MSRP: $59.99From the very start, The Witcher 3 is a return to form in terms of presenting the core Witcher lore from the first game. Unlike the second iteration, where many elements important to the overarching story were teased or merely mentioned in passing, you get to see more events up close. You’ll have the chance to experience The Wild Hunt itself even more-so than the original title, which is going to be a huge bonus for fans of the series. You get to delve deeper into the world as a whole, and the more personal take on Geralt makes it even better.Over the course of The Wild Hunt, players will experience Geralt as a teacher, lover, and hero. There are far more opportunities to actually be a Witcher, haggling for goods and demanding gold for your service. These elements were always communicated in past games to some degree, but given the vast scope of this title, you’ll actually get to live it on a constant basis here. The script as a whole is also much sharper, with stronger dialog and a funnier general feel. It helps that it hosts the most interesting cast yet, like a funny young creature that loves to poop, a terrifying trio of witches, a dumb goat named Princess, and one very angry ghost baby.The setup this time around involves Ciri, a young woman that Geralt has essentially raised as his own daughter. She’s trained with Witchers, but she also hosts a power no one quite understands that has sparked the interest of The Wild Hunt — a mysterious and powerful group that roams the land and terrifies everyone who comes in contact with them. Geralt kicks off the adventure in search of Ciri, attempting to find her in various locations, learning of her whereabouts through story missions. Occasionally you’ll get to control Ciri herself in short standalone sequences, which serve as a window into her point of view and are a welcome brief departure from the Geralt show.In general, choices feel like they carry more weight in The Wild Hunt, and the characters are more fleshed out as a whole. I felt like the second game had way too many “Would you like to do option A or option B?” black and white choices, but the third iteration brings back some of the ambiguity from the original. There is immediacy to your decisions, but there are lasting consequences in some cases, with individuals that I actually cared about. I like Ciri in particular, and was inspired to press on to find out what happened to her. More importantly, the game is designed as a large collective of little choices compared to a few sweeping options in The Witcher 2. Having a bit of control over nearly every aspect of your personal story is a much more desirable design.A lot of you out there will probably be disappointed to learn that combat is now essentially Assassin’s Creed, as most of the nuances like stances from the first game and the slower flow of the second game are now gone. Instead, you’ll attack with light and heavy attacks, spicing things up with a few magic abilities, and separate dodge and roll buttons. Geralt still carries his trademark steel sword for humanoid opponents and silver for creatures, but since he automatically takes the appropriate one out most of the time, that bit of strategy is quashed too. It’s not enough to make the game “easy” (especially on higher settings) but normal is significantly more hack and slash oriented than The Witcher 2.For all of the streamlined changes though, I actually enjoy this take on combat the most. Your magic abilities run the gamut of everything you’d need, from traps to projectiles to a defensive shield, and the dodge mechanic works better than it ever has, which makes battles feel more action-oriented and less like an outdated pen-and-paper scheme. When you add in the ability to parry and counter, combat gets even more interesting. Ciri’s bits are even less expansive, as she can’t access an equipment or inventory screen at all, and only has a few unique spells at her disposal.When you’re exploring about, the way fast travel is handled is just about perfect. You can technically use it, but players will need to have explored the target area first, and access an actual dedicated fast-travel signpost. It encourages you to see the world without pulling your hair out and losing tons of time manually getting to places you’ve already been. Roach, your horse, will assist in finding those new locations, and the controls are fairly versatile with walking, running, and galloping options. Sailing is probably my favorite means of travel, and in one instance I was even left stranded on an island after enemies capsized my ship!Questing is also much more satisfying now because The Wild Hunt is less “tunnel” oriented. Thanks to the advancements of newer tech, the open world can be fully explored by climbing, sailing, and horseback riding. The climbing mechanics are a welcome addition, but like a lot of other sandbox titles (I’m looking at you, Bethesda), it comes with its own set of glitches and rough animations.Specifically, ridges and edges are problem areas, and I had Geralt get stuck a few times in the game world or die to very questionable amounts of fall damage. It doesn’t help the situation when a few main story quests have bugs in them as well. It should be noted though that there is a very forgiving checkpoint save system, and you can manually save at any time. I suggest doing so often.Once you get your first look at the world and see the new engine up-close, you’ll likely forget about those stiff movements and occasional rough patches. The draw distance is wonderful, and the map in general is insanely detailed. While there are three particular areas that are instanced (cut off from the rest of the world), the core area is huge, and would take you hours to fully traverse and explore, even if you didn’t stop to actually do anything.For the purposes of this review, I played The Witcher 3 on PS4, which features 1080p visuals, with a 30 frames-per-second cap. Unfortunately that latter figure is noticeable all too often, especially when you’re outside, moving the camera about, and fighting multiple enemies. I have to give it to CD Projekt RED for creating a beautiful, vast universe with very little in the way of load times, but the console edition does feel like a compromise. If you have the rig, I highly recommend taking a look at the PC version, though I haven’t had a chance to test out its stability just yet.There is something to be aware of in addition to the technical issues. While the combat and overall story have been improved, a lot of quests (particularly the transitions between story missions) involve “Witcher Vision.” Yep, Arkham‘s Detective Vision mechanic is now a part of the Witcher world, and you’re going to be spending a lot of time holding down a button, looking at footprints, and following them blindly to the next sequence. At first it’s a really cool mechanic, and appropriately represents a Witcher’s advanced sensory and tracking capabilities. But once you do it roughly 100 times, it gets a tad old.If you’re looking for a lengthy adventure, you’ll find pretty much everything you need here. With four difficulty levels (including a super easy mode) there’s something for everyone. Alchemy mechanics shine in The Wild Hunt, as there are lots of ingredient nodes all across the world, easily visible on the game’s mini-map — almost like the developers took a page from the newer Far Cry games. There’s literally hundreds of quests to complete, secret locations to find, and buried treasure to search for.The core story will last you a good while. It took me roughly 50 hours to complete the game. Hilariously enough, there is one point that feels like it’s the end, to the point where the game even warns you that you should save and that you cannot turn back after entering the area. After I finished that sequence, it turned out that I had at least another 10 hours to go. Once the story is said and done, a few select sidequests can’t be completed, but you’re plopped back into the world, ready to explore. I suspect I’ll be at it for over 100 hours by the time I’m ready to put the game back on the shelf.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a huge step up from its predecessor, mostly because it manages to tell a more compelling and personal tale. At the same time, that intimate feel is juxtaposed against a gigantic, sprawling open-world adventure that may hit some snags along the way but still comes out on top.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.
