Link: Official website""Oh Jesus Christ, what have you done?"" ThomasChen978 wants to know why a dozen bodies and a couple horse corpses are piled onto the train tracks bordering the early industrial town and New Orleans stand-in St. Denis. ""You just murdered half the village.""""No,"" I reply, ""That's us. This is us. These are our bodies.""We're on round two of growing the recursive corpse pile. My posse got the idea to jump in front of the train after a few rounds of Lasso Your Friends And Toss Them Into The Sea with a couple friendly strangers. Red Dead Redemption 2, like GTA 5, has its own bowling minigame, we explain to Chen in a roundabout way, his horror inverting into blissful awareness. Die in Red Dead Redemption 2's shared open world and you'll respawn fast enough to carry your own corpse around. The guy lines up with us. We must make it bigger. As the train comes around again, another posse tries to take us out. Chen defends us, but doesn't make it back to the tracks. He falls a few paces away, screaming. A true warrior's death. Red Dead Redemption 2 can be the biggest, dumbest videogame ball pit for impulsive children, a harrowing story about the forced dissolution of community, or simply a serene and contemplative hiking simulator. It's just about whatever you need it to be, and good at it too.Just hours before corpse-bowling I went on a solo hike through snowy forests, stepping in the long shadows cast across the snow by the rising moon. I heard the clap of a gunshot in the distance. Some wolf tracks marked the snow in the same direction. I followed them to see who won. Anytime I pay attention and look closely, RDR2 rewards my curiosity.The mind-boggling detail making up the massive world of RDR2 speaks to the creative force of a development team with an acute, obsessive dedication to realism (and all the money and time necessary to make it happen). Like how my friends' characters flinch when I fire a gun near them, how animal carcasses decompose over time, how NPCs react to a muddy or bloody outfit accordingly, how busting through a doorway scares everyone on the other side. It's hard to believe RDR2 is so deep and wide and is also a cohesive, playable thing. I already knew it from playing days worth of the console version. It's why I'm especially disappointed it debuted on PC in a somewhat busted state.For every unrehearsed multiplayer adventure, there are a couple disconnects or crashes to desktop. Rockstar's best story and characters yet intermittently filtered through a slideshow of frame hitches and freezes, finally addressed over a week after launch. RDR2, the best western game and one of the best open world games I've ever played released with enough stability issues to make it a difficult recommendation until everything is completely smoothed out.Every pretty vista is something to lose through Arthur's eyes.Red Dead Redemption 2's story mode follows the dying days of the wild west. The spreading industrial world encroaches on Arthur Morgan's small band of outlaws and social underdogs, an imperfect but loyal, loving, and self-sustaining community.Capitalism is reducing humans to their value as resources. Indigenous Americans are driven from the plains to make way for 'civilization' and commerce. Forests are brought down for lumber, the hills gutted for coal, and Morgan's chosen family is caught in the middle of it all, forced to run, assimilate, or respond with violent protest. They do all three. This is Rockstar's most serious drama yet, and it's really, really long. The story 'ends' after 40 to 50 hours if you're rushing, and then continues for another 10 to 15. Red Dead 2's main story missions are stubbornly typical Rockstar fare: ride to a destination talking all the while, do a tightly scripted albeit amusing thing, ride and chat to a final destination to finish up. Missions are often thrilling action sequences or hypnotically mundane portraits of ranch labor and trade, peppered with cutscenes, long winded bespoke animations, and excellent performances. They're just frustratingly rigid, to the point where it feels like I'm following stage directions rather than roleplaying the life of a vagabond in the old west. Step out of line in these missions and it's a failstate. In stark opposition to Red Dead Online, there's little in them that encourage players to think for themselves, each designed to serve the story foremost. The RDR2 show is a great one at least, luxuriating in the slow pace of life in the old west. It's not all life-and-death dramatics; my favorite missions involve shoveling shit, getting drunk with a friend, the resolution of old romance, and a hot air balloon ride. Working through the more rote, stringent tasks is worthwhile in the end anyway, bolstered by exceptional, ambient world-building and characterization. Side missions, minigames, small activities, and random world events—whether hunting down legendary gunslingers, catching a play, or stumbling across a woman stuck under a horse—all inform Arthur's character and the setting in subtle, enriching ways. Nested in the third act of a fully animated and voiced theatrical performance, something like 10 minutes in, it's possible to press the react button after a performer does a bit involving a telephone. Arthur will shout, ""The hell with the telephone!"" It's an optional activity, a long one, and reacting in that short window is a choice. I have to imagine most players will miss it, but it's there instead of Canned Response 1 through 3, because it's something Arthur would say, a grumpy goofball righteously set in his ways. God damn is it sad. An apocalypse that led to this. He'll write whole, actual diary entries about the 50 hour campaign, sketching memorable scenery and reflecting on the state of affairs of his chosen family, people he once knew, oscillating between hope and despair as his fortunes change. It's entirely optional reading, but a refreshingly intimate take on a traditionally masculine figure who harbors as many doubts and hopes as the next person. He'll sing to himself on lonesome rides and decry his aging body in the mirror. He'll have a rambling conversation with the horse-pinned woman as he gives her a ride to town, the two commenting on the troubles of working for rich, ungrateful men as a growing necessity. I feel it all.  Hillbillies might hold him up after making camp, a couple might attempt to rob him after inviting him over for dinner, a man with a snakebite might come stumbling out of the woods asking him to suck the poison out. These random encounters depict the brutal life on the fading frontier, as nature pushes back against the interlopers who seek to transform it. Arthur is a perfect vessel to see it through. It's because Arthur Morgan is one of the most deeply human characters I've played in a game, cruel and kind according to distinct principles carved out during a great turning point in American history. The game world, beautiful as it is, is made more beautiful and tragic in how it's propped up to play off him at every opportunity. Every pretty vista is something to lose through Arthur's eyes, cut through by power lines and train tracks, the skies and his remaining life slowly filling up with factory smoke. Just about everyone sees an unhappy ending in RDR2, too. It's a story I might not retain every moment of, but I won't forget its brutal arc or the man in the middle of it all. God damn is it sad. An apocalypse that led to this. I'm desperately trying to get an artful picture of the silhouette of my horse shitting against the moon.Assuming you're capable of running it at higher settings, RDR2's greatest strength is in how it exquisitely renders the old west setting on PC, drawing more attention to the finer details that make it up. It's one of the best looking games I've seen, and a rare experience that justifies a new GPU or CPU. Improved draw distances and added vegetation detail at greater distances make some vistas look photographic. Long shadows transform walks or rides between locations from chores to lovely nature tours. Blemishes from animal attacks, bullet holes, rain, mud, or blood mark up clothes in sharp detail thanks to much higher resolution textures, telling little stories about what your friends have been up to. A new photo mode makes it easy to share those moments of awe. As the kind of player who goes on hikes in RDR2 just for the sights and sounds, it's a vital feature. I'm desperately trying to get an artful picture of the silhouette of my horse shitting against the moon, yet another self-appointed goal afforded by this ridiculously massive, intricate game. With a 2080, i9-9900K, and 32GB of RAM, I can run RDR2 on mostly ultra settings with a few resource-intensive settings turned down or switched off completely. But some hardware combinations are proving troublesome for RDR2, leading to random crashes in certain APIs and, up until a recent hotfix, major hitching issues for some 4-core CPUs.For all that good data, check out our initial benchmarks and performance analysis. I couldn't spend more than an hour playing without crashing to desktop during the first weekend, though switching from DX12 (which gives me better framerates) back to Vulkan stabilized things. Sometimes the UI bugs out and I can't choose a select or purchase option, the map fails to appear, or I get unexpectedly punted from the game servers. The graphics settings are almost too numerous as well, and perhaps misleading. In our testing, only a handful of settings affected performance more than 1-2 percent. The big remainders, MSAA, volumetric lighting, and parallax occlusion mapping among them, affect performance from 5 to 25 percent. Most of them don't make big visual differences anyway and are best left off. The way the settings are presented feels underdeveloped: a massive list with vague presets that require tinkering to get RDR2 running at a satisfying framerate. It's daunting. The PC should be the best place to play, not the best place to play, eventually, after a few patches. A shame for a game this good-looking. There wasn't much actual fishing to be had in our fishing trip, but I'll take a memorable moment of stupidity, a cute little pocket of drama and action, over any amount of trout.Just as in the singleplayer mode, in Red Dead Online I can reasonably make up my own goals and see them through. Problem is, it's fundamentally hamstrung by a frustrating multiplayer leveling system that locks basic tools and cosmetics behind tall XP requirements that can take hours, maybe days, to meet. The alternative is spending gold, the premium currency, to unlock items and clothes immediately. A fishing pole isn't available until level 14. A damn fishing pole in The Outdoor Recreation Game. It's not a great look and a terrible way to get players invested. But once I waded through the bureaucracy of progression systems and filled out a basic suite of tools (fishing rod, bow, varmint rifle, nice hat, etc), Red Dead Online opened up wide. I've largely ignored the traditional matchmaking modes like gunfights and horse races, cheap thrills I'd rather play much better versions of in different games, opting to make my own fun. It's led some of the most inventive, serene, surreal, and outright dumb adventures I've had in some time.Chris Livingston and I set out to go fishing, just because. Fish are pocket change if sold to butchers and cooking them restores health and stamina, but, like the best bits of RDR2, fishing is just fun for the sake of it. A nice virtual day on the water partaking in the philosopher's sport. Sounds nice. After tossing an innocent into the water for his boat, we get curious if we can hitch a ride on one of the big shipping boats in the distance, uncertain whether it's a physical object or the just videogame scenery to be seen but not touched. We take off from Turkey Island (so many turkeys), and row like hell. Our tiny boat scrapes the side of the big sucker and starts taking on water. Chris makes a daring leap and just grabs the edge of the deck. I flounder in the swift current—it's all over, man—while Chris calls out from the side of the large vessel, disappearing around the bend. There wasn't much actual fishing to be had in our fishing trip, but I'll take a memorable moment of stupidity, a cute little pocket of drama and action, over any amount of trout. RDR2's open world is ripe with that kind of playfulness, completely borne from our curiosities and impulses and largely supported by the simulation.I once waltzed into the middle of a gunfight in Blackwater and carried player corpses to the church graveyard, one by one. Some posses caught on and attended the 'burials' of their friends. A corpse thanked me for the gesture. Later, in an extended streak of criminal activity, my posse and I captured another player and rather than murder them on the spot, we rode to the swamps and threw them in gator infested waters. I got the idea from doing the same thing to a friend.On a less absurd note, I set myself the ongoing goal of earning enough money strictly from hunting to purchase cold weather gear and a fine rifle. I'm going to hike into the mountains and find the finest grizzly bear hide there is, becoming a wizened mountain man adorned with animal skins with a beard that nearly touches the floor.In the meantime, I'm stopping city-wide gunfights by running through the streets and calling for a parley. I'm taking part in eight-player barroom brawls. I'm living the life of a normal cowboy in the best cowboy game there is. I just hope it cleans up soon. Check out PC Gamer's list of the best open world games for more massive adventures.Red Dead Redemption 2's stark, slow depiction of America's fading frontier is a monumental work straining against stubborn mission design and stability problems.

Eurogamer,"O.K. Corral.As Rockstar gives Red Dead Redemption 2 a belated release on PC, we're republishing our original review of its grand western adventure. We'll have more on the PC version in the coming days from Digital Foundry, and if you're playing and need a hand head to our extensive Red Dead Redemption 2 walkthrough.It's one of those cute ironies that Rockstar Games, most famous for the virtual cityscapes of the Grand Theft Auto series, would create what many consider its masterpiece when working with the dust and dirt of the wilds. When it launched in 2010, the open-world western Red Dead Redemption was as refreshing as a chill blast of mountain air: a bucolic, melancholy counterpoint to the madcap urban caricature of GTA. And so it's fitting that the sequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, makes its greatest strides in its world.This is a vast, staggeringly detailed open world. You could get out a virtual ruler to proclaim it Rockstar's biggest yet, or count every single NPC, line of dialogue, rock, tree and outhouse and say it's the developer's densest, but I'll leave all that for someone else. What I will say is that this is Rockstar's broadest canvas since Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, quite possibly even more so, with what no longer feels like a take on a single city or state but practically an entire country.There are the heights of Amorino, hidden under knee-deep snow, the flats of New Hanover, the bayous of Lemoyne, the opulent metropolis of Saint Denis, and the clipped greens of West Elizabeth. It's a map that offers Rockstar's take on the sights and sounds of late 19th-century New Orleans through to South Carolina, from Indiana to Iowa and plenty more besides - a forged snapshot of an America forever lost that is utterly convincing.It's those thousands of small details that do the convincing: the way the oil shimmers on the surface of the water that sits outside the factories of chilly Annesburg, the cold stare and silence that meets you when you drag your scruffy frame through the saloon doors of the more cultured Saint Denis, the lamps that flicker across the midnight quiet in the town of Rhodes. It's the way it'll make a keen botanist of you, admiring the Spanish moss that hangs from the bald cypress of the bayou, the pines up in the mountains or the white oaks down on the plains, all shifting beautifully in the breeze. Even before you get to the fauna that lies underneath, it's a world that feels alive.It's in the way you'll see that weather build overhead, thick crops of cloud rolling in over the expanse of country - from most vantage points the horizon is thrillingly distant, the sky so vast above it all - while meticulously studied cloud formations swirl together. The craft that's gone into Red Dead Redemption 2's world - painstaking, expensive and arguably at too great a human cost - is evident in every frame.And it's enriched by an artistry and technical excellence that's just as evident. If the original Red Dead Redemption leaned heavily on celluloid depictions of the west, then its follow-up is much more painterly in tone. The landscapes of 19th-century artist Albert Bierstadt are one noted influence, those thick oils impressively mirrored in Red Dead Redemption 2's own textures; in the dawn or dusk of certain days, there's a richness to the light that would make Turner blush, veering, at times, towards a certain impressionism in the diffuse light.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a world of vivid textures, too. There's the thick mud you brawl in along the main strip of Valentine, the town where your adventures start, the coarse leather of a coat you've crafted from the wildlife you're free to hunt down, or just the taut hide of your horse that ferries you from place to place. It's a world you have a tangible place in, thanks to Rockstar's use once again of Euphoria animation technology that sees you stumble, sprint and collide with objects in the world, grounding you in it. Impressively - and somewhat cruelly - that extends to your horse now too, an aggressive trot into a tree trunk proving just as grisly as any of GTA's more violent moments. That physicality, brilliantly, extends to your inventory system. Kill a deer and to take it back to your camp you'll sling it on the back of your horse for the ride home, watching its soft belly jostle in time with the canter. The same philosophy extends to the weapons you take with you, picked up from your horse and slung over your back. It's a smart way of grounding you even further in Red Dead Redemption 2's world, even if - in what becomes something of a recurring theme - that elegance isn't met by the deeper design, where an overly fussy rotary selection system has you all fingers and thumbs when performing even the most perfunctory task. That philosophy can be effective, though. Red Dead Redemption 2's world leaves an impact on your avatar, the pointedly gritty wilds muddying your horse's hide and your clothes until you either brush your ride down and pay to use a bathhouse or incur the disgust and disdain of those around you. That dirt will clog up your arsenal as well, requiring you to clean your guns lest they lose their potency. It's part of that same busywork - very engaging busywork, mind - in which you can maintain the length of your hair and beard or let it grow unruly, can choose to pomade it in the morning or cover it with your favourite hat (which you may well lose in a fight if you're not careful - though thankfully you can pick up anyone else's in its place), or you can get thin or fat depending on whether you overindulge in the food you're required to eat in order to maintain your stamina core. This is a neat idea - and another with tinges of the maximalist Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - that's again undone by muddiness of execution. In Red Dead Redemption 2, you have health and endurance that are governed by cores, which dictate how rapidly radial meters fill, which are also there for your horse and pop up on your mini-map intermittently and... if I sound confused, it's because after over 60 hours I still am, and those systems remain fuzzy throughout. Perhaps it's just the game's proximity to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where similar systems are crystal clear and hard-baked into the experience (in another similarity that's fluffed here, your choice of clothing has an impact - if you're not dressed appropriately in cold climates, for example, you'll shiver and your meters will take a hit). Red Dead Redemption 2's take seems inelegant, inconsequential and - both thankfully and damningly - easy to ignore. But Red Dead Redemption 2 wears its RPG trappings lightly, and wilfully so - it's happy, you sense, to take on a little fuzziness in order to sidestep fussiness, streamlining systems in order to keep you grounded in its world. That same approach is evident in your encounters - you can interact with every single non-player character, though your verbs are limited to simple interactions such as 'greet', 'callout', 'antagonise' or 'defuse'. There's always 'shoot' too, of course - something which is a bit too easy to do given a context-sensitive control system that, bewilderingly and fatally for some poor bystanders, occasionally has the button you draw your weapon with as the very same which you use to pull the trigger. In a game of often impeccable detail, it's a strange oversight. Red Dead Redemption 2's best stories, as ever in a Rockstar game, are to be found in the margins, the very best to be scribbled yourself. Sometimes that's just picking up on environmental details and connecting the dots - the gold prospector that sifts through their haul in the middle of a river, or maybe something even more sinister as you pick up the trail of a serial killer. Or maybe it's losing yourself in an epic hunt - there are almost 200 species here, each lovingly realised for you to shoot and skin and scalp - or stopping to help a stranger in one of the seemingly endless incidental encounters. Rockstar has its own tale that it wants to tell here, of course, and here there's a disconnect, and a friction, from a game that wants to impress that upon you - sometimes aggressively, boorishly so. Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in 1899, some 12 years before the original and when the American west was properly wild. If the first game was about how one outlaw dealt with being outmoded and pushed to extinction as 20th-century civilisation took hold and the country was tamed, then the sequel shows the process of that taming, in all its violence and turmoil. You're Arthur Morgan, veteran of the same group of outlaws that you hunt down as John Marston in the original game, chased across the land as they teeter on the edge of their own extinction. Morgan is a less fleshed-out creation than John Marston, though that's possibly by design - those small choices you're afforded enable you to build your own reading of him. Whether you push him towards sainthood or villainy, he's never quite as compelling, either, and as a result it's hard to get a grasp on what exactly Red Dead Redemption 2 is about. Whereas the first game was about the taming of the wilds, and of one man trying to tame himself alongside them, by drawing the clock back 10 years the sequel feels like a story in stasis.Partly it's about family, and loyalty, and that is backed up by one of Red Dead Redemption 2's most effective systems. Your gang's camp - which shifts across the map along with the story - is an upgradeable base, where you can invest as little or as much as you please, those choices reflected not only in appearances but also in how others react to you. There's a beautiful loop, when you're first establishing it, of heading out into the wilds for your own adventures then heading back with the spoils slung over the back of your horse ready to be cut up and placed in a stew for your comrades, and it's all told with those same outstanding incidentals you find elsewhere. One night there might be a party that breaks out when your gang is flourishing; the next morning, you'll wake up to a sea of heavy heads and hangovers. Such revelry is responsible for Red Dead Redemption 2's standout mission, a night on the tiles that shows how Rockstar's narrative skills have taken an unlikely yet highly welcome influence; it's the first use of in-game jump cuts I can recall since Blendo Games' 30 Flights of Loving, and when matched with Rockstar's own bawdy style and lavish production it's every bit as effective as you hoped it would be. Elsewhere, though, Red Dead Redemption 2 struggles to find a place for you as it tells its own story; the main missions stick too rigidly to the aging template of heading out to a point while characters chat amongst themselves, and when you get there, too often all you're allowed to do is perform a handful of quick-time events and engage in the inevitable shootout. Red Dead Redemption was always the more cinematic cousin to Grand Theft Auto, though it's only in the sequel that that cinema threatens to get in the way. There's an influence from Naughty Dog in the main missions that, when it pays off, can be spectacular - an explosive train chase, or a bar brawl told with exquisitely heavy animations - but one that can just as readily come apart at the seams. In a game that otherwise promises freedom, it's doubly frustrating to fail a mission for not being able to find the marks to trigger the next cinematic, or to reach your target in a chase only for it to magically teleport out of reach. Maybe that disappointment is down to how Morgan's story isn't the measure of Marston's, and how Red Dead Redemption 2 is too eager to fall back on the same story beats and ape the same moments. One direct lift, towards the second half of the game, simply underlines how this sequel lacks the grace of its predecessor, in the tale it tells at least. The 60 hours it takes to see Morgan's story through to the end can be a slog, then, but it's the next 60 where you'll find Red Dead Redemption 2's real grace, when you're away from the straitjacket of Rockstar's own story, where the world can breathe and its true potential is realised (and where, in an act of incredible generosity, that world opens up).  It's been eight years since the last Red Dead Redemption, and five since the release of Grand Theft Auto 5 - time that you can see and feel in every delicately crafted inch of a game of this scope and scale, yet time in which we've been spoilt by the likes of The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Rockstar's writers can't quite match the humanity and purpose of the former, nor can its designers match the integrity of the latter.It offers something else besides, though: a richness, detail and technical prowess that is breathtaking, and peerless. Is this Rockstar's greatest game, a new masterpiece alongside the original? There are one too many caveats, and one too many flaws at its heart, to leave me totally convinced. Is this its richest, most beautiful open world? Of that there's not a single doubt.

Metro GameCentral,"The biggest game of the year is finally here, but does Rockstar Games’ Western epic live up to expectations?Purely on a technical level, Red Dead Redemption II is one of the most impressive video games we’ve ever played. It has many other positive qualities, but the graphics are so astonishingly good it almost seems impossible. We have seen modern movies with worse CGI, and less convincing computer-generated characters, than this and yet Rockstar’s latest is a giant open world adventure with such an incredible level of detail that sometimes you question whether what you just saw really happened.It’s a staggering achievement and the sense of immersion that results from the combination of visuals, sound design, and interactivity is unparalleled. It’s by no means a game without flaws though and some players are sure to find its methodical pacing and emphasis on storytelling is not to their taste. But the game’s scope and ambition is such that it’s impossible not to be impressed, not least in how assuredly it handles every element of gameplay and presentation across its mammoth 60+ hour running time.But despite its enormous size Red Dead Redemption II is not a difficult game to describe, or to get your head around, especially if you’ve played the original or any of the recent Grand Theft Auto titles. It’s a prequel to the last game, but still set towards the end of the Wild West period when the US was becoming more civilised and outlaws were beginning to find their way of life untenable. You play as Arthur Morgan, a veteran of the Old West who is part of the Dutch Van der Linde gang of travelling bandits.By default, Arthur is a relatively principled character although how you choose to play him determines the exact nature of his personality – as indicated by a sliding scale between evil and virtuous whenever you decide to rob and kill, or not kill, someone. As usual for Rockstar the plot is left in the background for the majority of the time and revolves around a disastrous job that occurs just before the game starts and which has left several members of the gang dead or injured and all their money in a town they dare not re-enter.Once the immediate danger of pursuit by the law (aka the tutorial) is over you’re left to your own devices, to explore and exploit the game world however you want. Structurally this is achieved either via traditional story missions, optional side quests, or simply robbing and hunting as you please. Whichever path you take though will inevitably lead you back to your camp, where you’re encouraged to leave a donation to help the group as a whole and also bring back food.You don’t have to do this but in return you get to use, and upgrade, the facilities and chat with your compatriots who might then offer their own rewards or unique missions. Alternatively, you can set-up your own camp wherever you want, complete with the chance to cook and craft items. But however you do it it’s important to get a good night’s sleep, as the game monitors both your tiredness and hunger and limits your stamina and health if it gets low.Rockstar’s on again/off again interest in role-playing elements has received criticism in the past but although these are some of the most involved they’re not nearly as restrictive as they sound and very much add to the sense of realism and immersion. After all, improving your stamina by running makes a lot more sense than just spending a skill point and the game is all the better for it.Rockstar’s weakness as a developer has always been in its gameplay mechanics. Going back to the earlier GTA titles it’s shocking how poorly some of the games control and how fiddly and unsatisfying the combat can be. And while Red Dead Redemption II is generally an improvement even on GTA V there are still echoes of those earlier issues in Arthur’s slightly clumsy movement and some finickity interface controls – with a selector wheel that seems to purposefully ignore your inputs at the most inopportune of moments.Melee combat is very simplistic, and the gunplay is similarly straightforward, but crucially both are consistently entertaining. By default the aim assist is so powerful that headshots are almost a triviality but somehow that never gets old and the dead eye slow motion ability, which can be upgrade multiple times through consistent use, is similarly fun to use.Much like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, the combat mechanics alone aren’t nuanced enough to justify such a long game, although Red Dead Redemption II does much better than Ubisoft’s title in presenting a variety of scenarios and distractions to obfuscate that fact. There are a lot of sieges and straightforward shootouts but also a number of memorably more inventive confrontations, such as a game of cat and mouse in a cornfield and a tense chase around a dense graveyard.The historical setting means that the range of weapons is limited and in truth of none of them make that much difference that you couldn’t just stick with a basic pistol and rifle and happily complete the whole game that way. But the fact that this has forced Rockstar to be more inventive with the setting and nature of combat sequences works very much to the game’s favour.Riding your horse is also purposefully uncomplicated, to the point where it requires almost no real skill (there are several races throughout the game, all of which we won first time). This streamlining of gameplay elements is likely to be the game’s most controversial element but in context it barely registers as a complaint. Hunting the game’s huge menagerie of animals is probably the most difficult activity in the game, since it requires stealth as well as accuracy, but its greatest pleasure is simply using it as an excuse to enjoy the staggering landscapes and unparalleled attention to detail.The closer gaming gets to actual photorealism the less useful the term becomes but there are frequent moments during the game where you could swear you were watching a wildlife documentary rather than playing a video game. We’ve found it difficult to verify whether horse testicles really do change size depending on weather conditions (a genuine claim made before release) but we have no hesitation in believing it given how realistically things like snow and water are modelled – and the fact that part of the stealth element of hunting is knowing which way the wind is blowing.Although the most impressive moment that sticks in our mind was when unloading an animal carcass outside a shop and accidentally dropping it in the mud, which immediately got it dirty; not just with a quick smear of brown but what seemed to be a physically accurate modelling of exactly where the fur touched the ground and how the mud would’ve stuck to it.We expect Red Dead Redemption II will end up being compared to Zelda: Breath Of The Wild a lot, given there are many superficial similarities, but the approaches are completely different. Breath Of The Wild has virtually no story but its traversal mechanics are more intrinsically entertaining and its world, untethered from the mundanities of real life, much more interactive. Which approach you prefer is a matter of personal taste though and both games certainly deserve to be spoken of in the same breath.On a technical level Red Dead Redemption II is beyond reproach (except for characters’ hair, oddly, which is often distractingly bad) and in those terms probably the most impressive video game we’ve ever seen. Critiquing the storytelling is more difficult but it’s clearly borne of similarly unrestrained ambitions. And yet the way it’s conveyed is very traditional. In fact, the game as a whole could almost be accused of being old-fashioned, despite its state-of-the-art presentation. Cut scenes are frequent, although generally shorter and less self-indulgent than in the last game, but they still work in the same well-established way as any other game.Some story-orientated missions can end with the realisation that you’ve barely done anything interactive, let alone anything requiring any skill, the whole time. Most missions are also preceded by, and sometimes end with, long riding sequences in which one or more of the gang accompanies you and talks the whole way. Some hours into the game we began to ponder the question of whether there’s lots of talking because there are such long rides or whether there are such long rides because Rockstar wants to include a lot of talking.It’s at this point that you realise how much Red Dead Redemption II has in common with walking sims, only presented in a much more dynamic way. That isn’t a criticism though, indeed the only minor complaint we have about the storytelling is that it takes a long time for the game to establish its major themes. There’s some on-the-nose dialogue at the beginning about society versus savagery but it’s only really in the second half of the game that it begins to move away from straight plot and begins to weave a story with more thematic depth.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023Eventually you begin to realise exactly what Arthur and gang leader Dutch represent, the former personifying the Old West itself and the latter the intangible promise of the American dream. Normally Rockstar’s best writing is to be found in its satirical radio shows and side content but here there’s real substance to the story itself, and while it does sometimes seem to underplay the racism of the era the issue, as well as sexism and other bigotries, are tackled head-on numerous times.Red Dead Redemption II is an incredible achievement in almost every way and despite some misgivings probably our favourite Rockstar game ever. It’s certainly their most successful storytelling experience and enough to make you hope they never give up on single-player the way they seem to have with GTA V (there is a multiplayer mode for Red Dead Redemption II but little is known about it at the moment and it’s only going to be in beta this year).Since this is clearly set to be an enormous hit anyway it seems redundant to shower the game with any more superlatives, but Red Dead Redemption II deserves them all. We have our quibbles with some of its design decisions but all the most important things it gets exactly right, and the end result is one of the most impressive video games ever made.In Short: An incredible technical achievement and a hugely accomplished Western epic that, despite a few minor flaws, represents Rockstar Games’ most engaging and ambitious work so far.Pros: Astounding graphics and attention to detail. Immense range of things to see and do with well-drawn characters and interesting themes.Cons: Controls are a little clumsy, combat is one note and very easy. A lot of the storytelling can be disappointingly non-interactive.Score: 9/10

Here’s how it works.One of the top three open-worlds of all time, and the best game Rockstar has ever made. An all-time Old West masterpiece.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.There’s no way to say the following without sounding wildly definitive, so here goes…. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best looking video game of all time. Yes, EVER. And that includes Uncharted 4. It’s also the best game of the past five years. Compare this Wild West epic to GTA 3’s blocky Liberty City and its cast of fugly thugs you probably kneecapped on a tiny TV 17 years ago, and the evolution is astounding. At times, it’s scarcely believable how good Rockstar’s latest sandbox looks and feels. Not counting GTA 5’s remaster, this is the first game the studio has properly released this console generation. Unsurprisingly, in the years since the Los Santos sensation launched, Rockstar has built up a wealth of things to say. As such, RDR2 is a game of big themes and even bigger ideas. The evils of creeping capitalism. Corrupt regimes. The loss of long-held beliefs. With its contextual conversations, where its outlaw lead can either greet or antagonise hundreds of bespoke NPCs, the game also tries to move open-worlds forward. Here, your main interactions often involve swapping pleasantries (or devastating, old timey disses), while significant portions of the main story involve quiet, peaceful character-building. Compared to the wanton carousel of slaughter so many other sandboxes choose to ride, RDR2’s more thoughtful, less trigger-happy approach feels like a progressive step. Although that said, you still end up shooting hundreds of dudes. Don’t worry, most of ‘em deserve it. Playing on Xbox One X at 4K, this frontier fable isn’t just incredibly sharp, it boasts the most impressive lighting and weather effects around. Wait until you see a soupy morning mist coat the game’s southerly plantation fields or get caught in a screen-shaking thunderstorm, then try to disagree. If you’re lucky enough to own a high-end 4K TV, the visual splendour RDR2 routinely spits out is a match for even the most cutting-edge games on PC; remarkable seeing as this is running on (slightly) ageing consoles, not an insanely expensive graphics card. Even if you’re ‘only’ playing at 1080p on a standard Xbox One or PS4, this supremely pretty open-world is filled with incredible environments and super expressive character models. A prequel and companion piece to 2010’s Red Dead Redemption, the story of criminal cowboy Arthur Morgan unfolds like one of Sergio Leone’s sombre yet knowingly playful Spaghetti Westerns. Of course, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly lasts a couple of hours, not upwards of 70. A twisting tale of torn loyalties and outdated ideals, it features several returning (albeit younger) characters from its predecessor, including a fresh-faced John Marston, who has a pleasingly crucial role in Arthur’s journey. Mournful, melancholy, majestic, the game’s sweeping tale of out-of-their-depth outlaws plays out across the backdrop of a rapidly changing U.S. heartland in the dying days of the 19th century. 23 essential Red Dead Redemption 2 tips you'll need to know before you playBefore wading further into the Old West weeds to tell you exactly why RDR2 is the best game of the last half decade, it’s difficult to entirely separate the adventure from the recent accusations levelled at Rockstar Games. Much of the conversation surrounding the launch of the open-world epic has focused on claims of a caustic culture of 100-hour working weeks. Whatever the truth of the matter, this is a complex issue that could spill deep into this review and beyond. RDR2 bears all the the hallmarks of an intensive, eight-year-long production schedule; a labour of love (and perhaps less positive aspects of triple-A development) which nevertheless stands a cut above its contemporaries. As of right now, the cowboy classic represents the current pinnacle of video game design. This is an all-time great: a masterpiece that deserves to be mentioned alongside Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, Skyrim, and most recently, The Witcher 3.RDR2 is a ready-made anecdote generator. Sit a dozen people down with the game and I’ll bet you Clint Eastwood’s last Fistful of Dollars every last one would see scenarios totally individual to their playthrough. Rockstar’s extraordinary open-world is as wide as it is deep. This is an adventure so stuffed full of amazing emergent moments, when the end credits roll after a full week of captivating, criminal play, there are enough incredible memories to fill ten lesser games. ""Red Dead Redemption 2 is a ready-made anecdote generator""You might see a hungry gator pull a screeching boar into the bayou abyss of Lemoyne’s richly detailed swamplands (think Rockstar’s take on an old timey Louisiana). You’ll enter into countless slow-mo Dead Eye shootouts using Arthur’s impactful array of guns – some battles improve even further with RDR2’s optional, awesome first-person mode. You may fall for a horse (then quickly lasso the filly to make it your mount) after watching it joyfully roll around the flooded grasslands of Grizzlies West. Your Arthur might even be treated to a free jacket from one of the game’s general stores when a stranger rewards you for that time you saved their life near the snaking rivers of Cumberland Falls. Said good (totally random) deed most likely involved Morgan sucking snake venom out of the guy’s thigh. Now let's never speak of the serpent slurping incident again.The world these emergent activities occur in is astounding. Forget GTA 5’s Blaine County, or the blustery beauty of The Witcher 3’s fantasy kingdom: RDR2 has the most impressive map you’ve ever explored. Honestly, it’s astonishing. Far bigger than GTA’s fictional California – and remember, you can’t zip around Morgan’s Western world in a helicopter – it spans snow-covered mountain regions, dense swamps, dramatic oil fields lifted straight from There Will Be Blood, and even a sizeable New Orleans-inspired city. There’s also a secret, sprawling area folk will lose their minds over.How to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 fast travelWhen it comes to scripted story missions, there’s no other open-world – well, perhaps GTA 5 – that comes close to matching the sheer quality of Redemption 2’s core campaign quests. Over 60-odd hours of sheriff-shooting, bank-robbing, bridge-blowing action, there’s only one generic, cookie cutter ‘tail the target’ objective that springs to mind. The majority of Arthur’s law-breaking missions all centre on strong story-building. Most involve constantly inventive tasks, including unlikely costume changes, outrageous modes of transport, or challenges as varied as mingling at a cocktail ball to teaching a young boy how to fish. Considering there are 104 main missions – for context, Franklin, Michael and Trevor’s Los Santos caper ‘merely’ has 79 – such variety is even more impressive. Story-wise, this is perhaps the boldest triple-A game ever made. Arthur’s tale undergoes the least predictable, most ambitious twists you could ever imagine. If you’re sensitive to very minor spoilers, you might want to step away until the next paragraph. Still here? Lovely. Then let’s just say the final 15 hour epilogue (yup, you read that right) is nothing short of astonishing. Wholly surprising and thoughtfully mature, it’s an example of the sort of high caliber storytelling we all deserve in 2018, but few big budget games have delivered since 2013’s The Last of Us.""It’s an example of the sort of high caliber storytelling we all deserve in 2018"" There are also a ridiculous amount of detailed side systems in RDR2, and every last one is worth your time. Engrossing animal hunts involve tracking scent trails before targeting a critter’s vitals organs, and they’re all more engaging and in-depth than every Cabela’s game combined. Upgrading your gang camp’s food, medicine and ammo tents also adds a tactical management element to the action, while fully fledged weapons-crafting and meters affecting Arthur’s health, hunger and stamina ensure you have to keep your outlaw’s belly full and fitness up if he’s to stay at his sharpshooting best. RDR2 is so detailed, even Morgan’s hair and beard grow in real(ish) time. If you don’t want Arthur ending up like some Wild West yeti, treat your cowpoke to regular trips to one of the game’s barbers. In a cute nod to CJ from GTA: San Andreas, the outlaw also loses or gains weight if he eats too little or too much – don’t worry, the results are less cartoonishly exaggerated than shoving Clucking Bell bucket meals down Carl's throat. Couple this with extensive wardrobe options, which let you tweak everything from your antihero’s shirts and vests, to even the spurs on his boots, and few open-worlds give you this much agency over your character. A word – alright, several gushing sentences – on the music. Woody Jackson has done a sensational job on the soundtrack. The composer has scored every Rockstar title since the original Redemption, and this is his most aurally arousing work yet. The last game was celebrated for several wonderfully judged music moments, the most famous being Marston’s ride into Mexico to Jose Gonzalez’s ‘Far Away’. While the prequel may not have a song that’s as note-perfect as that haunting melody, the tracks that accompany the story’s key moments all work beautifully. As for general background music, Jackson’s score is both electrifying and eclectic. Somehow, it can dovetail between shredding your nerves during a terrifying cave assault involving cannibals, and perking up a scene where your cowboy chums celebrate some successful DIY by downing all the whiskey. ""Some may struggle with its initial blast of uncompromising pacing""Are there criticisms? Of course. For large parts of the game, there’s no fast-travel, which is bound to rub time-poor people up the wrong way. The first act is also downright slow, especially placed next to GTA 5’s barnburner opening. Some may struggle with this initial blast of uncompromising pacing, though when the full map open ups, the wait ultimately proves more than worth it. The early camp-building options are also jettisoned too soon, and certain missions can involve annoying, insta-fail objectives. And while the epilogue is generally brilliant, the last half hour lacks the brilliantly lean gut punch of the first Redemption’s finale.Just how good is Red Dead Redemption 2? Over the past few years, I’d argue the only games that deserve to be considered at this same ultra elite level are GTA 5, Metal Gear Solid 5, and The Witcher 3. This is a stone cold 5/5 classic that combines brilliant writing – Rockstar’s Houser brothers deliver another affecting, scythe-sharp script – amazing tech, and one of the most boldly structured plots to ever grace a triple-A title. The story is so well told, you’ll emotionally invest more in a horse during one crucial scene than you did even for Kratos in this year’s stellar God of War revival. If you only buy one game this year, it absolutely has to be this wondrous Wild West quest. Reviewed on Xbox One X, and we'd certainly advose playing it on something from our best gaming TV  guide.David has worked for Future under many guises, including for GamesRadar+ and the Official Xbox Magazine.

Game Informer,"The world of Red Dead Redemption II is defined by violence, both in its passive and active forms. Bandits roam the highways, pilfering from the wealthy and poor alike. Predators mercilessly hunt and kill their prey in the unforgiving wilderness. Men of industry don’t blink twice stepping over the bodies of the sick and the dead to realize their economic ambitions. In this primordial stew of fear and savagery, the outlaw Van der Linde gang feels right at home. Led by the charismatic and resourceful Dutch van der Linde, this gang doesn’t think of itself as part of the problem. They support each other, primarily rob from the greed-lined pockets of the rich, and share the pioneer goal of buying a remote piece of land and settling down together far from the freedom-crushing existence of society. But as power structures shift and the unrelenting progress of government and technology swallow the untamed West, their particular sort of violence is speeding toward extinction.If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption, you already know how this tragic story ends. But watching the fabric that holds the gang together fray and unravel as the law chases them across the country over the course of Red Dead Redemption II is riveting nonetheless. Once-vibrant camp nights filled with campfire songs and revelry are slowly replaced by suffocating discontent. Rival factions develop among the gang, and watching Dutch van der Linde transition from a relatively principled leader to an unhinged psychopath is one of the most vivid and raw portraits of villainy I’ve seen. Standing in the center of this savage storm is Arthur Morgan, Dutch’s righthand man. His gruff exterior and icy stare paint the picture of the prototypical outlaw, but underneath this gunslinger veneer is a reflective man struggling with his own mortality and the wayward morality of the gang’s increasingly desperate actions. He still feels more at home among thieves, liars, and murderers than he does with honest civilians, but he increasingly contemplates the real cost of their heinous actions. Player actions determine which of four ways Morgan’s character arc ends, but regardless of your decisions, his intimate struggle with the life he chose serves as the questioning heart of this epic Western experience. Using the word “epic” to describe Red Dead Redemption II feels understated. This is the biggest and most cohesive adventure Rockstar Games has ever created. A rare harmony exists between the narrative, gameplay systems, open world, and mission design. Their interdependent nature makes it tough to talk at any length about each individual element without venturing into spoiler territory; the fashion in which these elements mingle and coalesce over the course of the journey is interesting to witness.  The story missions alone will likely take you 80-plus hours to complete. Surprisingly for a game of this length, Red Dead Redemption II only occasionally succumbs to repetition or boredom – primarily due to restrictions with when and where you can fast travel. As the gang is chased across the land by law, rival gangs, and the Pinkerton agency, Rockstar crafts a healthy diversity of settings. By the time you hang up your spurs, you will have robbed small-town banks, hijacked trains, executed jailbreaks, clashed with organized crime outfits, and challenged titans of industry. Sometimes you ride with the entire gang, other times the action revolves around only a few key actors, giving Rockstar time to flesh out Morgan’s compatriots. This includes getting to know Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston even better. Each gang member brings something unique to the table and most are likable, which gives the inevitable dissolution of their alliances a tragic weight. Violence is the only currency that applies across all the regions Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang traverse, so Red Dead Redemption II rarely leaves the comfort of wanton bloodshed, perhaps to a fault. That’s not to say the combat isn’t fun (it is), but it feels refreshing whenever Rockstar lets a mission play out without resorting to violent encounters, and I wish there were more quiet moments sprinkled throughout the story. The world is vibrant enough to sustain long sections where every mission doesn’t devolve into gunfights. Going back to other open-world games after playing Red Dead Redemption II won’t be easy; this is unequivocally the most well-crafted and fully realized open world in video games. The attention to detail Rockstar poured into creating this bloody interpretation of a historical period is remarkable. The wide expanses of wilderness feel alive thanks to an unrivaled dynamic weather system, ambient sound effects, and the most ambitious ecology of flora and fauna ever seen in games. You can spend hundreds of hours exploring the varied and gorgeous terrain, and Rockstar packs the game with side objectives to keep you busy. Hunting legendary animals, collecting plants for the crafting system, and exploring for dinosaur bones will keep you occupied on the frontier. Some of the best moments occur when you stumble onto a remote property and meet the colorful (and sometimes revolting) humans who call it home. When you head into town, Rockstar’s meticulous craftsmanship gets even more impressive. Each of the many towns and cities has its own character and personality, with the bustling New Orleans facsimile Saint Denis being the crown jewel. The cities are packed with things to do, from taking in a vaudeville show and getting your photo taken to meeting a memorable cast of strangers and perusing the intricately detailed shops. You can dive into a catalog at gun shops and general stores, or walk right up to the shelves and grab what you need. All the exteriors and interiors in the game look authentic to the time period and make you feel like you are visiting a place lost in time. Even the civilian population is remarkable – you can interact with each person you come across, and I rarely heard a repeated line of dialogue outside of some random encounters outside the city. New strangers continually pop up offering interesting side missions as well. Rockstar Games has outdone itself again with Red Dead Redemption II. The up-close portrayal of the outlaw Van der Linde gang’s unraveling is a compelling companion story that blends seamlessly with the original game, and depth and breadth of the open world is a technical triumph that every gamer should experience.

Polygon,"Filed under:Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the weirdest, most ambitious and confounding big-budget games of this decadeEarly in Red Dead Redemption 2, I meet a has-been gunslinger crumpled over a grimy bar in a livestock town on the outer fringe of the American West. He goes by Boy Calloway, but the codger’s a long way from that persona geographically, temporally, mentally. Aside Calloway sits his would-be biographer, in need of my services. Unable to squeeze a cogent anecdote from this puckered lemon, the author requests that I locate the living members of Calloway’s crew to gather stories of his former greatness, or strike dead those who would dispute the book’s “authenticity.” The assignment — like much of the game —  is optional, but I take it, figuring I’ll meet some legendary cowboys and gunslingers. That’s not quite what happens. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to the 2010 open-world Western, but I hesitate to say that it shares the genre. Like Calloway’s quest, the game isn’t quite what it claims to be. Set almost entirely within the American South two decades after Reconstruction, it tells two parallel stories: one, a fish-out-of-water journey featuring good-hearted criminal Arthur Morgan and his colleagues, all members of a notorious gang; the other, about the hollowness of mythmaking in the American West. It’s the latest entry in the trend of games that seem paradoxically crafted with love and a potent dose of self-hatred.Safe to say, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the weirdest, slowest, most confounding big-budget game of this decade — if not any decade.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.I’ve spent dozens of hours in Arthur’s boots, and for most of them, he behaves like just another member of an ensemble cast, offering a window into the day-to-day life of the men and women who have bought into the promise of their leader, Dutch van der Linde. They share stories about the old days that Calloway’s biographer would turn into a pulpy Western, but if a golden era ever really took place, it has unquestionably passed by the time this plot begins — a truth Arthur struggles to make amends with.Following a mysteriously botched job led by Dutch that ended with the death of an innocent bystander, the notorious Van der Linde Gang is moving eastward, outside the game’s equivalent of Texas and into the American South. Real states, cities and even politicians have alternate, fictional names here, with the creators taking inspiration from a moment but not recreating it precisely. I meet Arthur as he guides the gang through a tough Ozark winter. In no small part thanks to Arthur’s modest co-leadership, the Van der Linde Gang — composed of men, women and a child — survives the elements and the rival O’Driscoll gang, establishes a camp, and tries to recreate its Robin Hood-esque lifestyle of righteous crime in pursuit of financial security and freedom from the law. Rockstar Games’ Grand Theft Auto series has focused largely on men who adopt a life of crime in pursuit of the unattainable American dream, but the members of Dutch’s gang largely seem to have been wronged by the nation and want freedom from it. Every step of their journey is taken toward that one big job that can solve all their problems.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes its sweet country time getting to the heists. Before you rob a bank, you must learn to care for your health, gang, horse, camp and grooming. None of this is particularly tedious, some of it is quite fun, but most of it plays out like eating vegetables before the red meat is served. And I love veggies, but every sight and sound is hyping the main course. Stagecoaches, trains and camp upgrades allow for Arthur to travel large swaths of land, but riding to the train, then from the train to my destination, often felt just as laborious as taking the straight shot on horseback. Rockstar’s developers have designed a stunning, elevated take on the rural United States’ natural beauties, and they’ll be damned if you don’t see most of it trotting from point A to B and back again.Once Arthur learns how to be a functioning grown-up, after six or so hours, the game (and the world) loosens up. He spends the thrust of each day making money and trouble in pursuit of the grand escape to somewhere better, though whether that’s back in the West or outside the States depends on the people with whom he’s conspiring.13 things to know about Red Dead Redemption 2 before jumping inRed Dead Redemption 2 has a central storyline, plotted on a map of the game’s world in yellow dots. But the world is brimming with additional paths Arthur can choose to take along the way, themselves branching in various directions. Most are unmarked, and their events unfold in medias res. Similar moments appeared in the original Red Dead Redemption, but they’re dwarfed by the depth, variety and interactivity happening here. While searching for a former member of Calloway’s gang, I come across a man who is being attacked by wolves. I scare the animals away with a shot in the air and offer the man medicine — medicine that, I realize as I offer it, can hardly treat his mangled leg. He bleeds out, cursing me.Around the 20-hour mark — roughly one-third into the game — the story sets a stride, and I begin to establish my own rhythm alongside it. Days pass slowly in the game’s universe, and I spend most of them doing a mix of hunting for pelts and meat that will help me upgrade my clothes and feed the camp; running a couple of side missions to get to know the crew; and maybe completing a story mission to move everything else along, or perhaps taking a trip to town to gamble, collect a bounty poster or just see what will happen on the main drag. I have my guns and a lasso, items to sell, money to buy whatever I need, and — new to the series — the option to chat with anyone.Rockstar has the hubris to create not just another open world paired with a laundry list of activities, but also a simulation that binds it together. When it works, it’s astonishing, affecting and unintentionally funny in the way real life can be. As I try to defuse a robbery, I notice my horse taking a massive and seemingly endless dump just behind me. A bunch of code is directing the hundreds of animals and people around this world, but where most video game characters and creatures feel as if they’re repeating the same path into oblivion, this world does just enough to feel like a live space — at least until you push against the edges.Generally, the pillars propping up the simulation can’t be seen, but sometimes — for clarity — the designers opt for standard video game iconography. Arthur has “cores” that symbolize his health, stamina, and ability to slow time and shoot a bunch of people in a jiffy. They sit on the screen like icons on a car dashboard, flashing when they must be tended to with food, drink or remedies. Gorge on food to keep health up, and Arthur gains weight. Go heavy on the liquor, and he gets drunk. There’s a balance to what you consume, so chewing tobacco might help your aim in the short term, but hurt it long-term. It’s intimidating at first, until I begin to ignore the icons and just feed my pet Arthur before and after each mission. Treating him like a Tamagotchi that swallowed a bag of gravel makes the systems all but disappear.Arthur can engage with every character in Red Dead Redemption 2 by greeting them, antagonizing them or robbing them. It’s a limited means of communication, but an upgrade from so many action games that begin and end most conversations with a bullet. The trouble with presenting a fully interactive world is that, when the internal logic fails, the unrealistic reaction is all the more jarring. I don’t expect to interact with the generic crowds in Red Dead’s contemporaries, like Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry, but giving me the option to converse with every individual dramatically changes what I assume the game will allow me to do.Early in Red Dead Redemption 2, a captured rival, bound to a post, begs me for food. I pick up food, but I see no option to feed him. I can eat, which upsets him. But when I toss the food on the ground, he doesn’t react. Here’s another example: A crowd watches a public hanging. After the execution, the crowd disperses, and I find the victim’s mother weeping in the mud. I want to console her, but for whatever reason, the game won’t let me “greet” or “antagonize” the distraught mother. The only option it gives me is to pull a gun on her. While the game’s creators invite players to think of engagement beyond their weapon, it’s frustrating how few opportunities I have had to show empathy or compassion.A few years ago, I spoke with someone who worked on the Microsoft Kinect, and I keep returning to a point they made about designing for innovation. If something new works 99 percent of the time, that sounds great. But say the object in question is a phone, and the user checks the device 100 times a day; that means the device fails once a day. Suddenly, that extra 1 percent is unforgivable. The phone ceases to feel like a natural appendage, and becomes more like a tool.When the systems in Red Dead Redemption 2 fail — or don’t live up to their promise — it changes how I play. Initially, I tried to spark my own stories with the people in the world. Now, I respond to the world, rather than hoping it might respond to me. The exception to this rule, somewhat, is communicating and cooperating with Arthur’s fellow gang members. Each member of the Van der Linde Gang has their own backstory and ambitions, which are communicated if you chat with them around the campfire or over a meal. I join them on everything from fishing trips to home invasions, where they share insight into their lives. Hours of conversations can be had in the camp, and I am happy with how the game’s conclusion rewards those conversations. Each member of the crew fits into the larger plot; getting to know them makes later dramatic turns all the richer.The people of color in the gang carry the additional burden of introducing Arthur — and, by proxy, the player — to the reality of how America treats them. Where white members of the gang concern themselves only with the next heist, black and Native American members worry as much about their own survival.Arthur is impossibly naïve, to the point that Lenny, a black member of the gang, must explain that plantation owners would consider lynching him for the color of his skin. Charles, who is Native American, helps Arthur hunt and acts as a liaison with a tribe that, he explains, has been shuffled from reservation to reservation as the government caters to oil barons. I don’t believe Charles’ tribe is ever identified, though he works with Arthur to help the Wapiti, a fictional tribe that Rockstar PR told me is “not modelled on a specific tribe,” but is a “mix of Native American peoples who have been pushed together by the changes being forced across the entire region.” The game’s mashing together of real-world people, locations and groups into single entities produces story beats that range from benign to confused to insensitive and harmful.Characters regularly speak about their experiences with bigotry, but the game mostly keeps the mechanisms of white supremacy at arm’s length. At one point, Arthur takes Lenny drinking, only for his friend to get mobbed by the cops. But the next time he sees Lenny, all is well. Lenny reflects on the night at the saloon the way a frat boy flippantly jokes about an evening of memories erased by blackout drinking. A couple of times, I come across a mob of Ku Klux Klan members holding a cross burning in the woods at night. On one occasion, they light themselves on fire. On another, a few members are crushed beneath the weight of the large cross. The face of white supremacy is played for slapstick comedy, betraying the reality of a mechanism of hate that killed entire communities in acts of terror. In the real Gilded Age American South, the white hoods concealed politicians, law enforcement officers and business owners. Here, they cover up Abbott and Costello.The story’s final chapter is an exception, in which Arthur manages to be a participant in oppression and grotesque manipulation, while also being absolved of his role in the matter every step of the way. In this manner, Arthur’s journey is a lot like that of Forrest Gump. He stumbles through some of American history’s biggest and ugliest sins, oblivious to the scope of their evil, yet angelic in how he always finds himself on the inherent side of good. The commentary on the American South and the mythological Western genre works much better when Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on entitlement and power. At the story’s midpoint, Dutch tries to leverage the conflict between two plantation owners in the game’s equivalent of rural Louisiana. They’re vile and richly drawn monsters, and there’s a certain pleasure in gradually dismantling their lives. Nearly every Rockstar game has lampooned cults, using them as a blunt metaphor for the American obsession with righteous salvation. But with Dutch’s gang, Rockstar has for the first time really captured a cult’s appeal and danger. Like so many fanatical leaders, Dutch exploits the insecurities and desires of his followers, promising them exactly what they want. He uses a Machiavellian approach to justify increasingly horrific missions. And he never stops punting. It’s always one more job till the big payday that will turn everything around. He’s a huckster, and the parallels to modern politics are clear, despite Rockstar showing — at least in this respect — an uncommon restraint. A positive, meta side effect of Dutch’s strategic messiness is how failure makes for memorable and unpredictable missions. In previous Rockstar games, a series of missions anticipated a big heist. In Red Dead Redemption 2, a conversation at camp can be interrupted as Arthur is given a gun and a mask and a plan with little notice and less foresight.The game is set at the turn of the 20th century, but missions play out like the jobs in Michael Mann’s iconic heist film Heat (a film that Rockstar revisits for inspiration in game after game). Arthur and a selection of gang members enter a bank or train or business with a few guns, an outside factor interferes with the plan, and they must react on the fly to stay alive and get away with whatever they can. The gunplay and combat isn’t dramatically improved from Grand Theft Auto 5, which is to say, in 2018, it’s serviceable. The more that missions focus on the busy work of a heist rather than on nailing headshots, the better.With each heist attempt, the region responds to the gang like an infection. The group targets plantation owners and heirs, power brokers, robber barons, and a pre-Progressive Era federal government, but a couple dozen folks eking out a life on the fringes of a small trading town can’t compete with hulking institutions powered by an unlimited supply of money and weapons, soldiers, police and mercenaries. In short order, their simplistic “Wild West philosophy” gets crushed beneath a time and a place that’s too complex for them to comprehend, let alone compete with.The game’s writers set a foundation that feels as though it could use individual characters to launch a further-reaching story about cultural systems, like the books of James Baldwin, the TV shows of David Simon and the films of director Steve McQueen. But ultimately, the story is too sentimental, and the game too loyal to the video game story trajectory, in which missions become bigger and more explosive, rather than more critical and introspective. The final acts’ required missions vacillate between various styles of genre fiction, zipping from Uncharted-like action set-pieces to a horror showdown with inbred families.This week, reporting at Kotaku has highlighted the human cost of making Red Dead Redemption 2, with anonymous sources citing pressure to work intense amounts of overtime for weeks, months or even years. In New York magazine, Rockstar co-founder and Red Dead co-writer Dan Houser himself discussed working 100-hour weeks, a statement he quickly walked back. Then, in a British GQ profile, Houser said that he and Sam Houser, his brother and business partner, talk about how “games are still magical. It’s like they’re made by elves. You turn on the screen and it’s just this world that exists on TV. I think you gain something by not knowing how they’re made. As much as we might lose something in terms of people’s respect for what we do, their enjoyment of what we do is enhanced. Which is probably more important.”As the game spirals in its final chapters — in tone, in ambition, in message — I can feel the circumstance of its creation. This isn’t the magic of elves; it’s the creative hodgepodge of thousands of individuals.On the one hand, this is damning. Scale hinders specificity, and a story about the tragedy of the American South demands specificity. It’s hard to even gauge if Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its own goals, because by the end, it appears to be a bit of everything: a violent shooter, a cracking heist flick, a meditation on mortality, a high school American history class.On the other hand, even with the tonal messiness, the game routinely centers itself around a valuable philosophy: The golden myths of the Wild West era, the stories of dime-store Westerns, are just that — myths. And that allows for it to be something for everybody, even when that something isn’t always for me. At its best, the story breaks away from the Western genre and plays like a cross between a heist movie, a domestic drama and a political thriller. At its worst, it’s a buddy action comedy. Mercifully, it manages to be more of the former than the latter.After Red Dead Redemption 2’s story concludes, a huge epilogue begins, and the game’s already gargantuan map grows even larger. I’m eager to dig into this postgame, where it seems I’ll be free to focus on taking in the beautiful, meticulously simulated world, rather than hurling myself into the middle of it. The coda reminds me of a trend that has benefited other open-world games through expansions — a smaller, more straightforward tale that makes use of this big, expensive world without having to justify every inch of its existence.The original Red Dead Redemption was about the future: how the colonizers of the West themselves couldn’t escape the encroachment of U.S. law, that the state would claim monopoly on violence. Red Dead Redemption 2 is about the past — how it was never what it seemed; how it can be weaponized against the present; that reality is nasty, knotted and often deliberately obscured by the oppressors.From the start, Calloway’s biographer plans a hagiography not of the intoxicated man at the bar in the middle of nowhere, but of a gunslinger who never existed and a place fondly reimagined. Along my journey, I make time to visit his gang members. I don’t find heroes; I just find folks hustling out a life in a country that has no interest in whether they live or die, unless it’s published in a page-turner. I can talk with them or antagonize them or shoot them. It doesn’t really matter. Calloway’s book will end up the same. And it will sell a million copies.

   on November 7, 2019 at 3:22PM PSTEditor's note: Red Dead Redemption 2 is now out on PC, and we spent 10 hours with the game on its new platform. Despite consistent game crashes on launch day, we were able to get the game running stably, and two updates were issued by Rockstar in response to the issues.Our experience has been largely positive. A roster of graphics options and the ability to play with a high frame rate helps the PC version separate itself from its console counterparts, given you have high-end specs; Red Dead 2 is a demanding game. It was already visually stunning on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, and the same is true in our case for PC. While some rare visual bugs appeared, they were inconsequential to the experience. Red Dead 2's control scheme has transitioned well to keyboard and mouse, too, though there are a few kinks to work around. Gamepad support is seamless.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Red Dead Redemption 2 Video ReviewRed Dead 2 remains a superb game and a gripping experience with gameplay systems that connect you to the world and the characters that embody it; you can read more in our original review from 2018 below. For more detail on the PC version specifically, be sure to read our full thoughts on Red Dead Redemption 2 as a PC port. -- Michael Higham, November 7, 2019Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about consequences where you have only the illusion of choice. Yes, there are some decisions to be made, and those decisions will shape your character and the world around you. But some of the most disastrous choices were made for you before the game even begins, leaving you to deal with the fallout. And because it's a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, you also (probably) know how the story ends. All that's left is discovering what happens in between and making the most of it. To that end, you fight against the repetitive nature of missions, frequent moral dilemmas, and the inconvenience of doing what's right. For the most part, the frustration that tension can cause is also what makes the story impactful, and when it all comes together, your effort is not wasted.At the beginning of Red Dead Redemption 2, the Van der Linde gang is already on the decline we know from the previous game is coming. After a heist gone wrong in Blackwater, they're on the run, down a few members, and on the verge of capture, starvation, and succumbing to a snowstorm. There are familiar faces--Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston chief among them--as well as new ones. As senior member Arthur Morgan, you're in the privileged position of being Dutch Van der Linde's right hand, privy to his machinations and included in the most important outings. Once the gang escapes the storm and settles into a temporary campsite, you're also put in charge of the camp's finances, meaning you pick out all the upgrades and supplies. If Dutch is the center of the gang, Arthur is adjacent to all its vital parts at once, and that gives you a lot of power.With that power, you're encouraged to do as you see fit and at your own pace. A lengthy series of story missions early on introduces you to some of the ways you can spend your time, including hunting, fishing, horse-rearing, and robbery. There are a lot of systems, and covering the basics takes several hours. While they're not so cleverly disguised as to not feel like tutorials, the actual learning is paced well in its integration with the story, and the missions also acquaint you with the characters and the surrounding area. For example, the fishing ""tutorial"" has you taking young Jack Marston out for the day, since John is not exactly great at fatherhood. Jack is pure and sweet--and incredibly vulnerable to all the gang's wrongdoings--and the mission is memorable for it.In addition to the mechanics of various activities, you're also presented with a few elements of semi-realism you need to contend with. Mainly, you need to eat to refill your health, stamina, and Dead Eye ability ""cores,"" which deplete over time. Eating too much or too little results in weight changes and stat debuffs. Eating itself isn't a problem, and neither is maintaining cores in general, but eating enough to maintain an average weight is intrusive; despite experimenting with what and how often I ate, I couldn't get Arthur out of the underweight range, and eating any more frequently would be too time-consuming to justify. You don't have to sleep (though you can to pass time and refill your cores), and surviving hot or cold temperatures comes down to choosing the right outfit from your item wheel, so managing your weight sticks out as superfluous rather than conducive to immersion.Limited fast travel options are the better-implemented side of Red Dead 2's realism, perhaps counterintuitively. There's next to no fast travel at the beginning and few methods in general, so you have to rely on your horse to get around. It can be slow, but there's no shortage of things to do and see along the way. Chance encounters are plentiful and frequently interesting; you might find a stranger in need of a ride to town or a snake bite victim who needs someone to suck the venom out of their wound. You can stumble upon a grotesque murder scene that sets you entirely off-track, or you can ignore someone in danger and just keep riding. And just as you can decide to rob or kill most anyone, you'll also run into people who will do the same to you. Even the longest rides aren't wasted time, and it's hard not to feel like you're missing something if you do opt for fast travel.Red Dead Redemption 2's version of America is vast and wide open, stretching from snowy mountains and the Great Plains down to the original game's New Austin in the southwest. Further to the east is the Louisiana-inspired Deep South, which is still feeling the effects of the Civil War after nearly 40 years. There's a distinct shift when traveling from region to region; as grassy hillsides become alligator-filled swamps, Union veterans give way to angry Confederate holdouts, and good intentions and casual racism turn into desperation and outright bigotry. The variety makes the world feel rich, and it both reacts to you and changes independently of your involvement; new buildings will go up as time goes on, and some of the people you talk to will remember you long after you first interacted with them (for better or worse).Incidental moments as you explore make up a large part of the morality system, in which you gain and lose honor based on your actions. ""Good"" morals are relative--you're a gang member, after all--but generally, it's more honorable to punch up rather than down. Helping an underdog, even if they're an escaped convict and even if you need to kill some cops or robbers to do it, can net you good guy points. In these situations, it's easier to be noble than a true outlaw. Committing a dishonorable crime is hard to do undetected, even in remote locations, and usually requires you to track down and threaten a witness, run and hide from the law, or pay a bounty down the line. While you'll earn money more quickly doing ""bad"" things, high honor gets you a pretty discount at shops, and you'll make good money either way through story missions.In many ways, you're nudged toward playing a ""good"" Arthur. The gang members he's closest to from the beginning are the more righteous, principled ones who are motivated by loyalty and a desire to help others, while he insults, argues with, and generally reacts negatively to those who are hot-headed and vicious. The most rotten of them is Micah, who's so easy to hate that it's hard not to follow Arthur's lead and take the higher road. Unlocking camp upgrades like one-way fast travel and better supplies also essentially forces you into being honorable; although everyone donates, you have to invest hundreds of dollars yourself if you want to afford anything, and that automatically gets you a ton of honor points whether you like it or not.One of the best, most understated details in the game is Arthur's journal, in which he recaps big events as well as random people you've met and more mundane, everyday things. He sketches places you go, doodles the plants and animals you find, and writes out thoughts he barely speaks out loud. The journal changes with your level of honor, but at least for a relatively honorable Arthur, the pages are filled with concerns and existential crises--inner turmoil over being either good or evil, for instance--that make you want to see him become a better person.Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how.It's a lot harder to feel like a good guy when doing the main story missions, though. Arthur, along with nearly everyone else, is loyal to the gang first and foremost. This means following Dutch into trouble, busting friends out of jail, and committing a number of robberies in the interest of getting money for the gang. Even if you're trying your hardest to be good, you'll inevitably slaughter entire towns in mandatory story missions--stealth and non-lethal takedowns aren't always an option, and the snappy auto-lock aim makes shootouts a far easier option anyway. The dissonance is frustrating to play through in the moment, but it's incredibly important to Arthur's arc as well as your understanding of the gang as a whole. To say any more would venture into spoiler territory.That extends to the structure of story missions, which start to get predictable around halfway through the game. It's not that they're boring--the opposite is true, actually, and you see a lot of action from beat to beat. But after a while, a pattern emerges, and it's easy to figure out how any given heist or raid is going to unfold. This too becomes frustrating, partially because you often have no way of significantly affecting the outcome despite any decision-making power you thought you might have had. But your weariness is also Arthur's, and that's crucial. The mid-game drags in service of the narrative, which only becomes apparent much later. There's also enough variety between missions and free-roam exploration to prevent it from dragging to the point of being a chore to play.Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how. If you played Red Dead Redemption, you know who survives and as a result who probably won't make it to the end of the game. Even during the slower parts, you're waiting for betrayals and injuries and other events you've only vaguely heard mention of before. You're waiting for characters to reveal their true selves, and watching as everything unravels is riveting and heartbreaking if you know what's to come.You can still enjoy the story in its own right without that background knowledge, though. Some of Red Dead Redemption 2's best moments have almost no relation to its predecessor. One mission takes you to a women's suffrage rally, and a painful side mission has you facing a woman whose husband you killed and life you ruined. The new characters are among the best, too; Sadie Adler is a personal favorite for reasons I won't spoil. Another, a young black man in the gang named Lenny, mentions how the Southerners treat him a little differently; Arthur says that he hasn't noticed anything weird, to which Lenny replies, ""All respect, Mr. Morgan, you wouldn't notice.""Generally, Red Dead 2 tackles pertinent issues of the era with care. Rather than defining any of its characters by the bigotry they may experience, it allows them the room to be well-rounded individuals while still not ignoring that things like racism and sexism exist. One arc focuses squarely on a very serious issue, and here, the lack of real choice in the story's direction--and your resulting involvement in what transpires--will likely make you uncomfortable in a powerful way.While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marston's story, Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde gang--as a community, as an idea, and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too, but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal, very messy story supports a larger tale. Some frustrating systems and a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though it does take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is hard to leave when it's done.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        Privacy PolicyenterRed Dead Redemption 2 offers up an astoundingly engrossing world that's remarkably easy to get lost in.Editor's note: This review was originally conducted in a podcast format, available as a video above or right here as an audio file. A summary of the review follows. Red Dead Redemption 2 is, in many ways, a pretty staggering video game. First and foremost, it is staggering in its scope. An open-world game in the grand tradition of Rockstar's lengthy catalogue in the genre, RDR2 offers up an Old West world that is massive in scale, teeming with life and activity, and astoundingly, exhaustingly detailed. It tells an uneven, but highly enjoyable tale set 12 years before the events of the first game, and largely affords its large cast of characters far more opportunities to endear themselves to the player than any other Rockstar production I've ever played. In the 60-plus hours I spent poking through every corner of RDR2's world, I constantly found myself getting lost in both the myriad activities it provides, and the simple pleasures of walking through its diverse and gorgeously rendered environments.And as I worked my way through this staggering game, I couldn't help but repeatedly think about the staggering amount of work that went into creating the game. I probably would have had that thought irrespective of recent events, just by virtue of how unusually polished the whole experience feels. But the recent reporting on conditions at Rockstar's various studios in the lead-up RDR2 undoubtedly intensified those thoughts. No matter how transfixed I became by the ""magic"" of what this game does, I found it difficult to shake the sensation that everything I was experiencing came at unreasonable expense.The story follows the adventures of Arthur Morgan, right-hand man to charismatic gang leader Dutch van der Linde. Players of the original Red Dead will recall that this gang is the one previous protagonist John Marston originated from. At this stage of history, Arthur, Dutch and crew are on the run following a failed job in the town of Blackwater. Throughout the story, the gang exists in a transient state. Moving from state to state, the crew finds itself mixed up in a wide variety of misadventures as they try to regather themselves and pull together the funds they need to finally disappear. As Arthur, you are essentially the gang's fixer. In addition to participating in the various robberies and related crimes that take place throughout the game, you'll also find yourself in charge of the gang's camp, a bustling communal space where you collect quests, manage resources, and just exist alongside the various personalities that encapsulate the gang.This is the best aspect of the game, not necessarily from any gameplay perspective, but rather in terms of overall immersion in the world. One of RDR2's greatest strengths is the lengths it goes to in order to make its world feel like it is breathing on its own. Other Rockstar open world games have largely focused on centering the player in every way. Everything is typically built like a playground, chock full of activities that exist at the forefront, while the various NPCs just sort of mill around. Here, the various cities, camps, and wild areas all feel like they are moving along at a lifelike pace. When you're in your gang camp, you'll see people doing chores, reading, playing games, and engaging in conversations that have nothing in particular to do with whatever quest you're about to embark upon. These personalities, these people, are the core of what makes RDR 2 go. There is a humanity to these characters that Rockstar games don't typically seem all that invested in portraying.The story itself does not always do right by its cast of characters, but its primary tale of Arthur's journey through the gang's final days is an extremely compelling one. The performance of Rob Clark as Arthur is a big part of that, but the writing is strong too. His motives are understandable, and his internal conflicts are thoughtfully portrayed throughout the campaign. Many of the other personalities around him are loud and cartoonish in ways you'd expect, but few of them feel like pure caricature. Where the writing does falter, it's largely around the margins of that core story. Its attempts at delving deeper into conflict between indigenous people and the US military feel too steeped in cliche to say anything of note, some of the various stranger missions peppered throughout the world are blandly obnoxious in the way the worst GTA missions can be, and there is more than a little seemingly unexamined irony in the story repeatedly making villains out of tyrannical capitalists and demagogues who work their people half to death entirely to their own benefit.The most gobsmacking thing about RDR2 is how all its various systems and characters are weaved into its world. Right from the jump, the game drops numerous tutorials about hunting, crafting, shooting, horse bonding, and a million other things both big and small. Some of these systems are more important than others, but there are opportunities to engage with them on a near constant basis. All these pieces, all these systems, are remarkably blended into the game world. The sheer number of mechanisms all working behind the scenes are exhausting enough to think about, but the way Rockstar has obscured all those gears grinding in the background is its most impressive trick. In most open world games it's not long before you can start seeing the seams. If not outright bugs and glitches--which RDR2 has, albeit in much smaller volume than you might expect--you'll eventually come upon quests and activities that feel like they've been copied from somewhere else in the game. Think about Far Cry's various towers, Assassin's Creed Odyssey's bandit camps and timed missions. Very little of RDR2 has that sensation. From the biggest missions right down to the smallest interactions, all of this stuff feels like it was constructed individually. I was inspired to do missions that I might have ignored in a more repetitive game because each one had its own distinct thing going on. I almost never thought of ticking off checkboxes as I went.You sense this everywhere you go in RDR2. I spent long stretches in the towns and cities following NPCs around to see where they went, what they interacted with. When out in the countryside, I constantly found myself standing still as I watched wildlife scurry around, and the wind blow through the grass and trees. This is a slow game, one where huge stretches involve little more than riding or walking from place to place, drinking in the atmosphere that surrounds you. This is a sensation I expect some players will bristle at. Arthur moves at a methodical pace, and while there are some sections where the controls feel flat out unintuitive or unresponsive, more often it's just a matter of letting Arthur's animations play out. And there are so many of them. So many. If you want to pick up a gun, skin an animal, even open a damn drawer, you'll have to watch him go through a realistically, if slowly paced animation for it. Hell, every major character in this game has their own distinctive way of moving through the world. It is a ludicrous amount of animation. Ludicrous.Details like this are easy to fixate on, especially when considering the amount of work poured into it. No one detail is by itself remarkable, but all these little details, these exhaustively rendered things, overwhelm the senses from the beginning and never really let up. The thing of it is, though, Red Dead Redemption 2 would still have been a pretty remarkable game without all these little details. They impress, no doubt, but knowing what we know about how Rockstar put people to work to make all those little things go, it's understandable to question whether it was necessarily worth all of that effort. In Kotaku's most recent reporting on the company's work culture, there's an anecdote at the beginning describing the way the game reframes the camera into a letterboxed shot every time it shifts from gameplay to a cutscene. This was apparently decided upon very late in the development cycle, and required members of the cinematics team to put in numerous overtime hours to rework. Does this particular feature look cool? Totally. Would I ever have noticed it wasn't there had they opted not to put their employees through a great deal of extra work to make this happen? Absolutely not.This is what it ultimately comes down to with Red Dead Redemption 2. It is an incredible achievement in open world gaming, an intricate machine that disguises its machinery better than just about anything else that's come before. In addition to its lengthy and engrossing campaign, it delivers moments of emergent storytelling more compelling than anything I can ever remember playing. Graphically and aurally, it is top-to-bottom stunning. And all that came at an expense of labor that, while in no way unusual for an industry steeped in a culture of endless crunch and burnout, nonetheless cannot be dismissed. How do you reconcile those two things? Do you boycott the game? Do you buy it to support the people who worked the hardest on it? I do not have that answer for you. I'm not sure anyone does at this stage. What I can say is that Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games I've ever played, and alongside the accolades the quality of its production richly deserves, it should always be noted what the circumstances were for those tasked with producing it. That is the asterisk this brilliant game should bear for as long as people feel like talking about it. The people who developed Red Dead Redemption 2--both credited and uncredited--should rightfully feel proud of all they have accomplished. Likewise, they should be afforded the opportunity to continue making games under circumstances more cognizant of, and beneficial to, their livelihoods going forward.© 2023 FANDOM, INC.

f so many game developers, is invisible but no less vital. How many of them caught a gameplay bug that might have destroyed my save file and forced me to start over? Did Reece Gagan, or Jay Patel? Which of them made sure that every plant my character picked from the ground believably flopped over in his hand? Maybe that was Okechi Jones-Williams, or Emily Greaves? And which names weren’t on that list at all? Who were the people who burned out and quit, only to be cut from the credits because, per Rockstar’s stated policy, they didn’t make it across the finish line?It is nearly impossible to answer any of those questions, just as it is impossible to assign credit for this marvelous and unusual game to any one person, or even any team of people. That’s just the way entertainment of this scale is made: vast numbers of people spread around the globe, churning for years in order to make something previously thought to be impossible. It’s a process from a different galaxy than the lone artist, sitting quietly in front of a blank easel. It has as much in common with industry as with art.For years, Rockstar—or at least, Rockstar management—has built and maintained a reputation for being talented, successful jerks. We make great games, their posture has always defiantly communicated, so fuck off. It’s a reputation bolstered by many Rockstar products, most notably the cynical Grand Theft Auto series, with its asshole characters and nihilistic worldview. Yet how to reconcile that reputation with Red Dead Redemption 2? Could a bunch of jerks really lead the effort to create something so filled with humanity and overwhelming beauty?“I suppose our reputation as a company was that we’re profoundly antisocial, histrionic and looking to be controversial,” Dan Houser told the New York Times in a 2012 interview promoting Grand Theft Auto V.  “And we simply never saw it in that light. We saw ourselves as people who were obsessed by quality, obsessed by game design.” Of course, it is possible to be all of those things at once, and given how antisocial and willfully controversial GTA V wound up being, it was hard at the time to take Houser’s comments at face value. Taken alongside this vastly more earnest, heartfelt new game, those comments assume a slightly different cast.Intentional or not, Red Dead Redemption 2 can be read as a meditation on failed leaders, and even as a potent critique of the internal and external cultures that Rockstar has helped perpetuate. Dutch Van der Linde is every inch the manipulative boss, frightening not only for his violent nature but for his ability to marshal people to work against their own self-interest. Time and again he reveals his shameless hypocrisy, and his promises of a new life are consistently shown to be empty maneuvering. “This isn’t a prison camp,” he says at one point, uncannily echoing every supervisor who has ever coerced an underling into a technically optional task. “I am not forcing anybody to stay. So either we’re in this together, working together to get out together, or we’re not. There simply isn’t a reality in which we do nothing and get everything.” I half-expected him to promise everyone bonuses if they hit their sales target.The parallels between game development and gang leadership aren’t always so readily apparent, but Red Dead Redemption 2 repeatedly sets its sights on the systematic damage enabled by irresponsible leaders. It does not celebrate Dutch’s actions or his worldview; it repudiates them in no uncertain terms. Dutch is a failure and a disgrace, arguably the game’s truest villain. Thanks to the first Red Dead, we already know that he fails. We even know how he dies—not in a blaze of noble glory, but alone and cold, with no one left to stand by him. Rockstar Games, one of the most successful entertainment purveyors on the planet, will never meet the same fate, but the people who wrote their latest game sure seem aware of the risks of ambition.Red Dead Redemption 2 is primarily a story about nature. Human nature, but also the natural world, and the catastrophic ways the two intersect. It is an often unbearably wistful homage to a long-lost era, not of human history, but of the Earth itself. It pines for a time when the wind carried only the scents of animals and cookfires, when the world was rich and its bounty seemed limitless, when the night sky was thick with stars and unmarred by light pollution. We do not live in that world, if we ever did. Every year it gets hotter; every year the storms are worse; every year it gets harder to breathe. We are careening toward ruin and no one seems able to stop us. Those with the power to lead appear too blinkered and self-interested to care.I was moved by this video game. I was moved by its characters and their sacrifices, and by the lies I heard them tell themselves. I was moved by its exceptional artistry, and by seeing yet again what is possible when thousands of people drain their precious talent and time into the creation of something spectacular. But above all that, I was moved that so many people would come together to make such a sweeping ode to nature itself; to the wind in the leaves, the mist in the forest, and the quiet hum of the crickets at twilight.Midway through the story, Arthur and Dutch arrive at the city of Saint Denis. “There she is, a real city,” spits Dutch. “The future.” The camera cuts away for our first look at this much-talked-about metropolis. The men have not been greeted with bright lights or theater marquees; they have been met with smokestacks, soot, and the deep groans of industry. An ominous, keening tone dominates the soundtrack. After hours spent freely riding in the open air, it is shocking.Several hours later, I departed Saint Denis and made my return to camp. As Arthur rode, the city outskirts gradually gave way to thickening underbrush. I began to see fewer buildings, and more trees. Before long Arthur and I were once again enfolded by the forest. It was twilight, and the wind was shushing through the trees. A thick fog rolled in, and emerald leaves swirled across the path ahead. I heard rumbles through my headphones; a storm was brewing. Alone in my office, I took a deep breath. I wondered if I would ever taste air as clean as the air Arthur was breathing at that moment.It is human nature to pursue greatness, even when that pursuit brings destruction. It is also human nature to pursue achievement as an end unto itself. Red Dead Redemption 2 is in some ways emblematic of those pursuits, and of their hollowness. The game is saying that progress is a cancer and that humanity poisons all that it touches, but it was forged at the apex of human progress. Its gee-whiz technical virtuosity has a built-in expiration date, and in ten years’ time, the cracks in its facades will be much more apparent. At unimaginable cost and with unsustainable effort, it establishes a new high-water mark that will perpetuate the entertainment industry’s relentless pursuit of more, accelerating a technological arms race that can only end at an inevitable, unfathomable breaking point.But there is a pulse pumping through this techno-artistic marvel. This game has heart; the kind of heart that is difficult to pin down but impossible to deny. It is a wonderful story about terrible people, and a vivacious, tremendously sad tribute to nature itself. There is so much beauty and joy in this expensive, exhausting thing. Somehow that makes it even more perfect—a breathtaking eulogy for a ruined world, created by, about," and for a society that ruined it."""

As Red Dead Redemption 2 PC is now available on via Epic Games Store and the Rockstar Launcher, we've republished our original review from October 2018. Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is essentially the same story and game, with a few additions - photo mode, 8K resolution support, unlocked frame rates and a few other PC additions - you can read how much they change things in our PC playtest here. 

Herding stray cattle in a storm. Stepping off a train as a drunk man stumbles out of a saloon. Watching the sun set on Mexico as José González’s Far Away marks the halfway point in an epic adventure - moments of quiet reflection dominate my memories of Red Dead Redemption.John Marston’s story was bespattered with brutality, but beauty was always only a dusty verge away in a world where violence and nature collide. Rockstar knows exactly what made the first game special and - as crunchy and satisfying as they were - it wasn’t the gunfights. With the prequel, the GTA developer doubles down on the serene, delivering a shooting game that isn’t afraid of keeping your guns in their holsters. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most confident, mature game Rockstar has ever made. You can see it immediately in the systems. The language of video games is set. We all know that squeezing the left trigger targets an enemy and the right trigger ends their virtual lives. Here, the left trigger isn’t used solely for murder, however - it’s how you interact with every part of the world. Lock onto a pedestrian and you can give them a tip of the hat and a friendly greeting - all contextual and based on a variety of factors. You can also antagonise them if you’d rather play as a douchebag. This also works for animals, allowing you to study them, whistle, pet them, and scold them. Rather than separating conversations out into dialogue choices and set scenes, this all happens seamlessly in-game. Bullets aren’t your only way of impacting this world, and the fact these conversations aren’t frozen in time - like dialogue options in an RPG - keeps things fluid. It’s a genuine piece of genre-leading innovation. Like I said, we are all fluent in the language of games: big ammo dumps mean there’s a boss fight coming; obvious waist-high cover warns of an impending gun battle; and characters are only capable of certain feats within cutscenes. Red Dead Redemption 2 evolves that language and creates a world where it feels like anything could happen at any time. Even in the final few hours of this generous, grand adventure, I was still seeing one-off animations, unique motion capture playing out on characters in real-time, and new surprises appearing in the world. It would be easy for me to list a bunch of things that happened to me when out exploring this rugged, wild landscape, reeling off the endless anecdotes, but I want to explain how it feels to be a part of this unpredictable ecosystem. You are not the sole agent of change. As Arthur Morgan, you are a member of the Van der Linde gang. As such, you are expected to contribute your share to the camp: offering up a percentage of your cash, ammo, medicine, and hunting goods. But the rest of your gang don’t wait for you to fill up the coffers - they also loot bodies, grab items, and take them back to camp.  
 
Attend a party in camp and there are people telling stories by the fire, gang members playing drinking games, people singing, people dancing, and couples talking among themselves. Just like in real life, you can’t hope to see and hear it all - you simply revel in the ambience and catch snippets in the noise, inserting yourself where you can. The world itself also evolves as you progress. Buildings stay burned down, houses are built, people die, people join your group, and whole towns go into lockdown over your deeds as your camp moves from place to place. Whether you are up in the snow-capped mountains, in the dank swamps of the bayou, or hiding out in the wild forests on edge of a coal mining town, soot-caked to your face from travelling through it on the way to camp, the game makes brilliant use of its space. You are always seeing some new place, and every inch of the map is packed with granular details and stunning horizons. The way the light hits the dusk mist gives the game a painterly, dreamlike, hyper-real quality. This is easily Rockstar’s best virtual place. Artistically, it is miles ahead of anything else. The map isn’t just gorgeous, either - it’s massively varied and teeming with life (over 200 species of animals can be found, each with their own unique behaviour), and you’re still seeing new areas in the final hours of this massive adventure. The way the music blends with exploration and swells for combat also pulls you into the fantasy, and vocal tracks are used sparingly and to stunning effect to highlight big moments in the story.Arthur Morgan’s tale is much more fleshed out than John Marston’s was in Red Dead Redemption. The fact you’re often paired with a companion gives the writing a chance to really dig into the characters as they play off each other. Even 40-50 hours in, one-off conversations with side characters add layers to the protagonist, revealing surprising facts about his past that shed light on his personality and his complex relationship with gang leader Dutch. Arthur's story is underpinned by a bittersweet irony, and it really feels like a tale of redemption this time. When the credits roll, you will appreciate Arthur as a character far more than you ever did of Red Dead protagonist John Marston. Saying that, this prequel does an incredible job of adding depth to the characters you know from the first game as well - you really understand Marston’s plight by seeing him live through his outlaw days, as well as the struggles he puts his wife and son through due to misplaced loyalty. It’s the perfect companion piece, complimenting the story and characters at every turn. Rockstar has previously been criticised for its writing of women, and that feels like something the writing team is addressing here. Each woman in the game has agency, and they all make their own decisions, bad and good. Sadie Adler, a widow who joins the gang early in the game, has one of the best character arcs in the entire story, and she’s up there with some of my favourite video game characters of all time. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a slow burning character study, interspersed with intense gunfights and one-off set-pieces. One minute you might be in a shootout, and the next you might be scooping up cow turds with a pitchfork. It might sound weird, but the moments of quiet give the punchy, tactile, and weighty gunplay something to contrast against. The Euphoria physics are still the best in gaming, seeing enemies clutch wounded areas, topple over railings, or fall into their stirrups to be dragged along by their horse. The weight of Arthur’s movement takes some getting used to and the aiming is a little more methodical than you might expect, but you feel like you’re controlling a person and combat really sings once it clicks because of how reactive the enemy AI is.  
 
There’s also a lot of riding around, which I didn’t mind, but experiences may vary. You can unlock fast travel, but you have to travel quite far a lot of the time just to reach the places where you can fast travel from. Rockstar doesn’t want to pull you out of the experience because it wants the journey to be an integral part of the story. Remember that time you rode off a cliff and you had to mercy kill Gary - your horse - before trekking back to civilisation, only for a pack of wolves to attack you? These unscripted moments stick with you as long as the gut punches of the story. Travelling across the world isn’t meant to be seen as a chore, it’s just more opportunity to see everything the game has to offer. In the entire game, I played two missions where I had to tail someone. I finished every stranger quest, every sidequest, and each main mission, and I was constantly surprised by the variety Rockstar has packed in. I won’t spoil anything here, but some of the missions are among the best, most memorable things I’ve ever played in an open world game. You should discover it all for yourself. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a brave prequel that isn’t afraid of taking risks. It is innovative, surprising, stunning, dramatic, and generous - a highlight of this generation and a benchmark for other open world games to aspire to. Versions tested: PS4 Pro (October 2018), PC (November 2019).Want to find the best horse or find a way to make money fast?

Red Dead Redemption 2 released just over a month ago on PC, and I’ve slowly made my way back through the tale of the death of the Old West. It’s the same great game we gave a perfect score when it released on consoles last year, and time has done nothing to sour the amazing journey Rockstar created. In fact, if you can throw the extra power at it, RDR2 looks and plays better than ever on PC.Unfortunately for many fans, the RDR2 PC port had a rocky launch. Many players complained of issues with the Rockstar Games Launcher, while others had technical issues that prevented them from enjoying the game. A month later, updates to both the game and the launcher seem to have eliminated many of these problems. Oddly, I only had one minor issue during my entire time reviewing the game.Since I already wrote an extensive review on Red Dead Redemption 2 when it launched last year, I will focus on the technical aspects of the PC port here. Besides the addition of a few new side missions and a couple of Red Dead Online weapons to single-player, this is the same game that released on Xbox One and PS4.The biggest addition that RDR2 on PC brings is a massive array of graphical options and improvements. Console versions of the game were capped at 30 FPS, and increased framerate is the most obvious advantage the PC version holds. While the game was beautiful on console, the higher framerate does a lot for playability.On my review PC I held a relatively stable 4K 60 FPS on an LG B8 OLED TV with almost everything except the shadows and water reflections maxed out. I saw some dips in areas like the swamps of Lemoyne where there a ton of trees and water being rendered simultaneously and in Saint Denis where there’s a lot of NPCS on-screen simultaneously. However, I was impressed by how well the game performed given that even the RTX 2080 Ti has some issues pushing 4K/60 FPS consistently in many titles.One of the biggest issues I believe people will have with RDR2 on PC, is that the settings harken back to the olden days of PC. Many ports give you a couple of handfuls of graphics options, most of which change little, and that’s it. RDR2 on the other hand, gives you around 50 different graphics settings you can tweak. This means if you want to get the best performance/quality ratio for your PC specs, you must spend the first hour after you’ve installed the game messing with the graphics options.Unfortunately, besides a running total of how much VRAM the current settings use, there’s not a lot of info to help you tune the game. It would be nice to get some tool tips to help figure out which settings have the most impact on performance. This is especially confusing when it comes to the choice of graphics APIs. RDR2 can use either DirectX 12 or Vulkan, and neither is the obvious choice. Some users report Vulkan giving them higher framerates, while DirectX 12 was the API that worked best for me.I feel like players who aren’t used to such fine tuning may discount RDR2 as being poorly optimized for PC. I don’t think that’s the case at all. Instead, the issue is there’s little direction on which settings are most intensive, so people are likely concentrating on VRAM or textures, when really the issue they’re probably having is shadow draw distance or water reflections.Once I took the time to tune RDR2 to my hardware, the game was wonderful. RDR2 pushed the Xbox One and PS4 to the limit, and it was great to play the game on a platform that has the power to drive it further. Everything in the game feels a little bit more responsive at 60 FPS, and the smoother motion makes gunfights and movement seem easier and more natural.The mouse and keyboard controls are a bit of a mixed bag for me, but many people will love the expanded binding options. You can set many interactions to their own key, which lets you skip some of the more awkward shortcuts required on a controller. You can set a key just to pet your horse, for example, whereas on console you have to hold L2/LT and then tap a button.The biggest advantage to mouse and keyboard is aiming. My Arthur on console was a pretty good shot, but he had his fair share of firing wild. On PC, though, Arthur is the best shot in the West, and possibly the rest of the world. With a mouse even the basic Cattleman Revolver becomes incredibly accurate, to the point where the game felt a little too easy at times. However, you still get enough enemies thrown at you to where taking cover is essential, and the more accurate controls don’t completely break the balance of the game.Despite the advantages of mouse and keyboard, I still ended up playing through most of the game with a controller. Even though the PC version does a good job of hiding it, it’s obvious movement in the game was designed with analog controls in mind. Moving around indoors can be frustrating at times with keyboard in mouse. Plus, I’m a bit biased since I played through the game on console already. I’m used to playing the game with a controller, and that’s what I prefer. However, despite the non-analog movement when using a keyboard, it doesn’t cause any issues big enough to prevent you from enjoying the game.Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is an even better experience than it was on consoles. Now that Rockstar has ironed out the launch issues, PC is the premiere platform for the game. The framerate increase alone is an amazing improvement, and as long as you have the horsepower, the game is even more stunning than it was when it released a year ago on PS4 and Xbox One.
My biggest warning to anyone considering purchasing RDR2 on PC is that you need to have patience when you set it up. Take the time to go through each graphics option, compare your performance on Vulkan vs. DirectX 12, and tailor the game to your specs. Once you have the game tuned, there’s no better way to experience it than on PC.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkThere was a period of time where my life was just one Red Dead Redemption 2 blur.I can’t say the same for Red Dead Online (yet), but the campaign enamored me and kept its tendrils in for weeks on end. It isn’t often that I truly get sucked into an open world without feeling like it’s just a collection of map dots and radar blips, and with a year’s time, I was ready to jump in again on PC.Naturally you want to hear about the latest graphics options, as Rockstar is touting this as their most advanced PC release yet.All of the bells and whistles from the console edition return, as well as the obvious upgrade of optional mouse and keyboard support. The bread and butter of the PC edition deals with the graphical options, of which there are many. Texture/lighting/shadow/reflection sliders are obvious well-worn territory, but it even gets as granular as mirror and water quality, as well as options for TAA (Temporal anti-aliasing)/FXAA (Fast Approximate anti-aliasing)/MSAA (Multisample anti-aliasing). Real-time ray tracing, the only major omission, is not in at the moment.Then there’s more advanced settings (that are locked by default) like volumetric resolution (lights and clouds), the quality of particle lighting, further water tweaking (refraction/reflection quality), and extra tweaks like fur and decal quality. The thing I noticed the most? The fantastic draw distance improvement, which is key for a game as big as this. NVIDIA has game-ready drivers for RDR2 available now, clocking in at roughly 576 MB on top of the huge 100GB+ file size of the game itself. Make some space, especially for updates/DLC! Load times can still be lengthy though: even with an SSD (with a sequential read speed of 3519.4 MB/s, with a write speed of 3290.4 MB/s), loading a new save can hit 25 seconds. Upon jacking everything up to ultra, my game crashed. But other than exceeding the limitations of what my rig can handle, I haven’t had any problems.I’m rocking a new Falcon Northwest 20th Anniversary Talon with an Intel i9-9900KS with 32GB of RAM, installed on an SSD and (x2) GeForce RTX 2080 Supers (that I’ll be reviewing soon!), so you could say that my rig is approaching top of the line. A benchmark tool is available, and running nearly everything on “ultra” or “high” settings in 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels), it hit an average FPS of 48.76 (topping out at 64.317) with SLI, 43.3 without. Running it at 2560×1600 yielded an average of 61.6284 also with SLI, 59.1352 without. Here’s a visual comparison of 2560×1600 versus 4K. That should give you an idea of what’s required to run this bad boy (optimization?), but popping yokels in 60FPS with a mouse and keyboard rules.I know what you’re thinking: another launcher, right? Although Red Dead Redemption 2 is available on multiple platforms (Epic Games is the marquee alternative right now, with Steam to launch in December), I had access to it via the Rockstar Games launcher and so far it’s been pretty seamless. Rockstar offers cloud save sync every time you connect and are online, and the Rockstar Social Club instantly loads because you’ve already authenticated. A small benefit, sure, but something to consider. Or you can wait for Steam.So how’s the game? Still good. It takes a while to really get started and introduce you to the true open range, but once that intro is over and done with it’s off to the races. Mod support (which is being allowed so long as it’s not commercial) will only make things better once the community gets started. The photo mode has been great, allowing for excess (read: 200) photo taking, on top of options like blur strength and more lens effects (here’s tintype). Rockstar Club access is integrated for posting, allowing you to dump your pictures and keep freeing up space. This is the sort of game that begs for a photo mode (more so than nearly anything else this past year), so take advantage of it.If you’ve been holding out for Red Dead Redemption 2, now is the time to strike, even if you have no interest in the online component. It has pretty much everything a PC enthusiast would want outside of ray tracing, which is more of a near-future tech anyway. If you’re still on the fence, holding out for a sale (more platforms = more price drops!) and mods is also a smart idea. Everyone benefits from a PC release.[These impressions are based on a retail copy of the PC edition of the game, provided by the publisher. If I had to score it, it would be the same as the console release – 9.5]

Game Revolution,"

Jason Faulkner 
Since they practically invented the open-world sandbox with Grand Theft Auto 3, Rockstar Games has produced some of the most complex and beloved worlds in video game history. It’s been five years since its last game, Grand Theft Auto 5, debuted, and with the soon to be released Red Dead Redemption 2, we get its first experience tailored wholly around this generation of consoles.The original Red Dead Redemption brought the western genre into video games like never before. The tale of the dying gasps of the wild west as civilization pushed towards the Pacific struck a chord with millions of fans, and the news of a prequel was met with great fanfare. However, the original game left plenty of questions unanswered and stories untold.As I hunted down the scattered remnants of the Van der Linde gang in RDR, I wondered why John rode with them in the past, and what exactly made the gang rise to such notoriety. Red Dead Redemption 2 answers those questions and more. While doing so, it crafts the most in-depth open-world experience since The Witcher 3 and rivals that game in both storytelling and worldbuilding.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in 1899, 12 years before the original. It’s around this time that the decline of the wild west lifestyle is beginning. You play as Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang and leader Dutch Van der Linde’s right-hand man.As the game begins, we find the gang running across the snowy mountains of the north after a botched robbery attempt in the town of Blackwater. The initial act of RDR 2 centers around just surviving. Between the cold and a rival gang that has taken up residence in the mountains, the Van der Linde gang’s luck has turned for the worst, and just finding a place the band can call home temporarily is a struggle.It’s in this initial act that one of the game’s overarching themes is introduced: loyalty. Dutch inspires intense loyalty from his followers, and even in the midst of a freezing blizzard, they’re willing to follow his orders despite the risk of life and limb. Arthur may be the most loyal, supporting and believing in Dutch even after the terrible situation his decisions in Blackwater put the gang in.As the story progresses, the question of loyalty becomes a more complicated one. Many members of the gang, including a young John Marston, find themselves questioning their commitment to Dutch as his decisions and attitude moves them from a group of gold-hearted thieves (think Robin Hood and his Merry Men) who just want to live their lives free from the bonds of civilized society to a darker, more selfish band of killers.During the story, you get to see (and shape to an extent) Arthur’s morality develop. In the beginning, he’s little more than a yes-man, there to back Dutch up with a nod or a bullet. As the game continues, there’s an internal struggle within Arthur as to whether he should be loyal to Dutch or loyal to himself. This is where the theme of redemption comes into play. How far is too far, and once you’re there, is there any coming back?Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in a fictional analog of the American southeast, north, midwest, and west. Although the place names are fictional, I’d say the terrain represented is as far north as Minnesota, east to Missouri, south to Louisiana, and west to California.I don’t want to spoil any surprises the map may hold by going into a ton of detail, but fans of the original will be pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of some familiar places. Red Dead Redemption 2 has much more varied terrain in the sections of the map that are new for this game, though. In addition to the desert and plains of the original game, you can travel to snowy mountains, through the grassy heartland, and into the bayou and swamp.This is a time period where civilization is starting to push west, so there’s an incredible blend of things going on in the world of RDR 2. In the north and northwest, you have forest, mountains, and rivers, with only a house here or there to spoil the wilderness.In the central part of the map is the more settled heartland where you are a lot more likely to run into people. However, the heartland still has a bit of a wild feel, and the main settlements of Valentine and Strawberry look a lot like your stereotypical pioneer or western town.To the south and southeast, you run into the bayou, which is dotted with marshes and swamps. Here you’ll find alligators, catfish, and people who don’t take kindly to strangers. This is contrasted by the sprawling Saint-Denis, a town reminiscent of New Orleans which combines the trappings of a large city with the mystique of the Creole and Cajun peoples.No matter where the story takes you, or where you choose to spend your free time, there’s so much to do and see in RDR 2. Each location features different architecture and different culture. It was awesome to see the contrast between the very stereotypically western Valentine, where the populace is made up of ranchers and farmers, with Saint-Denis, where the NPCs speak French and dress in city fashion.Not only is the map huge, the little touches stated above make it feel like you’re actually going somewhere. It’s not just some big homogenized mass full of fluff and filler. You can tell that the world is handcrafted and that thought was put into even the most remote of locations. Trains and stagecoaches also don’t do the usual video game trick of disappearing and appearing at random. They have their own timetables and stops, passengers board them and disembark, and the whole game is full of little things like this that add to the feeling of immersion.In 1899 the semi-automatic pistol was a new invention, and revolvers were still by and far the most widely used type of sidearm. In Red Dead Redemption 2, gunfighting is a bit more subdued than that seen in Grand Theft Auto, but with what Rockstar has done with the system, it feels more vital and intimate than just firing off a submachine gun.The type of action a gun has plays more into how it controls than almost any game I’ve seen. A Cattleman Revolver (the game’s version of the Colt Single Action Army), for example, will fire when you aim and press R2, but must be cocked with R2 before you can shoot again.This gives an accurate portrayal of the single-action mechanism of the gun. The same gameplay mechanic holds true with repeaters, shotguns, and bolt-action rifles. You have to manually chamber a round before you can fire again. It also adds a new facet to balance for the game’s firearms. For example, you can purchase or find a Double-Action Revolver to use as a sidearm, which has an increased rate of fire over the Cattleman since there’s no need to cock it after each shot. However, the Double-Action is of a smaller caliber than the Cattleman Revolver, so you make a trade-off in damage. For a third option, though, you can fire the Cattleman revolver from the hip. Arthur will fan the hammer, increasing fire rate, but decreasing accuracy.Arthur can carry a sidearm (and an offhand sidearm later on), and two longarms on his shoulder and back. Any weapons you don’t take with you stay with your horse. This means you have to think about what approach you want to bring to each situation before you head into it. If you’re planning a hunt or a stealth mission you’ll want to make sure to grab your bow. For mowing down enemies at a distance, you’ll want a rifle. Having to choose your armament beforehand adds a bit of realism and challenge to RDR 2, and really makes you think of the purpose behind your arsenal.Each gun is customizable as well. If you want a fancy, engraved, matching set of pistols, you can head to your nearest gunsmith. You can modify grips, metal finishes (on multiple parts of the gun), engravings (and their finishes), barrel lengths, and more. You can also add upgrades like improved rifling and scopes to select weapons.For much of the game, I used a customized set of Schofield pistols I modeled after Dante’s Ebony and Ivory from Devil May Cry. Arthur will use whatever sidearm you have equipped in cutscenes as well, so you get to enjoy seeing your customized guns during story bits.Weapons stats are also affected by more than just the construction of the gun. The more familiar your character becomes with a gun by using it, the more performance they’ll get out of it. You can also switch between multiple ammunition types to increase range or damage for a firearm. You can even use ammo with special properties like being incendiary or explosive.You have to care for your firearms as well. Over time or when you get particularly dirty, your guns will start to foul up, and you’ll need to oil them to maintain their condition. Ignore a dirty gun, and you’ll notice penalties to its various stats will crop up.One criticism the original Red Dead Redemption received was that horses felt a bit more like cars with legs than living breathing creatures. It makes sense that if you spent as much time with a horse as the characters in these games do you’d form an attachment to them. In Red Dead Redemption 2 this has been rectified thoroughly, and your relationship with horses is much deeper this time around.Because Red Dead Redemption 2 has limited fast travel, you’re going to be using your horse to get around for the most part. Through the deserts, mountains, plains, and swamps you’ll depend on your horse to get you where you need to go. There are 19 different kinds of horses, and each breed has their own peculiarities and comes in several different colors.You get a horse for free initially, but after that, it’s up to you what kind is right for you. You might want to get a Thoroughbred racehorse for quick speed and acceleration. However, if you’re planning on long rides, a draft horse like the Shire or Belgian Draft Horse, with their immense stamina, might be better for you.The horse bonding system makes it worthwhile to stick with an individual horse and form a connection with them. Keeping them clean by brushing them, making sure they’re fed, and patting them will increase your bond, which will, in turn, allow you to perform more complex maneuvers on the horse, and improve their health and stamina.Bonding with your horse is all about balance as well. If you feed your horse too much, it’ll become overweight and take a stamina penalty. If you don’t feed it enough, it can grow underweight and take a health penalty. You have to take care of your horse as diligently as you do Arthur if you want to get the most out of them.Like with guns, you can select from a wide array of saddles, horse blankets, saddlebags, and bedrolls to outfit your horse with. You can also choose different mane and tail styles and colors, and you can keep up to four horses at the same time.What really brings it all together, though is horse behavior. When you first ride a horse, it might act skittish and need reassuring while you ride it. When you pat it, it’ll stretch its neck and close its eyes in pleasure. I loved watching all the little reactions to stimuli that the horses have, and of course, the most realistic part of all is that they defecate just as a real horse would. The character customization is just as deep as that of the horses and guns. There are a ton of different clothing options to choose from, and you can have Arthur look like a down and out pauper or a turn of the century aristocrat and everything in between.Again, this is a system that would have been cool with just picking from the vast array of clothes and accessories, but what’s going on in the background is what makes it really special. Arthur gets dirty, whether it be mud or blood, and you have to either wash off in a bath in town or plunge into a river to get clean. Arthur’s current hygienic state will be commented on too, so if you don’t want to be known for your stench, you need to keep clean.Temperature comes into play in the game too. As stated above, your travels will take you through snow and desert. When choosing an outfit, you’ll have to note what sort of weather it’s appropriate for. Each area has its own temperature which fluctuates throughout the day, and it will affect your character if they’re not wearing the right outfit. Wear a winter coat in the desert of a light shirt in the snow, and you’ll find that your health core will drain faster. Luckily, you can keep a few changes of clothes on your horse, so it adds a bit of realism without making you go too far out of your way.You’ll also find that Arthur’s hair grows as you play. It can take a few weeks of in-game time, but you’ll go from stubble to full-on ZZ Top as the clock turns. This means if you want a certain hairstyle you’ll need to visit the barber often to maintain it. It’s a far cry from when you could turn a fade to an afro in GTA San Andreas, and it adds quite a bit to the immersion and sense of the passage of time.There’s also a bit of the survival genre in Red Dead Redemption 2. Your three meters, health, stamina, and Dead Eye, all have a core that depletes with time or overuse. As time passes, your stamina core drains which makes your stamina meter recharge slower, to remedy this, you can go to sleep or eat. The same goes for health and Dead Eye. You have to maintain Arthur’s health with food or sleep, or he won’t be at his peak. Like with horses you can also overfeed or underfeed him and receive penalties to specific stats.All three of these stats are leveled up in real-time. The more you run, the stronger your stamina stat will get, and so on. This adds a significant RPG element that was missing from the original RDR and gives you a reward for doing something as simple as running.While the large and immediately apparent aspects of this game are fantastic, it’s the little things that really bring it to life. Whether it’s hunting or fishing against a beautiful backdrop, or getting a haircut because you noticed your character’s hair has gotten a bit too long, all the little background things come together to make a thrilling and immersive world.You know a game is good when you start thinking about its characters and its world more like they were real than just projections on a screen. It’s easy to get caught up in Red Dead Redemption 2 and start thinking of Dutch, Arthur, and others like you really know them, especially after you spend the 50-60 hour main story with them. Even after clearing the story at that mark, there’s still a ton to do and explore in the game, and it’s a bit overwhelming (in a good way).The astounding thing about RDR 2 is that there’s not only a staggering amount of story, side quests, and places to explore but that it’s all high quality and doesn’t feel tacked on. The high level of craftsmanship in this game is evident in all its aspects, and it’s genuinely one of the best games of this generation of gaming.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkGetting lost in another world is a perfectly good way for some people to cope with problems in reality.The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind got me through some really tough times: no matter what happened, at the end of the day I could relax and lose myself in Vvardenfell until I dozed off. That was all the way back in 2002.Open world games have considerably evolved since then. Rockstar is proof of that.Red Dead Redemption 2 (PS4 [reviewed on a PS4 Pro], Xbox One)Developer: Rockstar StudiosPublisher: Rockstar GamesReleased: October 26, 2018MSRP: $59.99Red Dead Redemption 2 makes the ballsy and possibly confusing move of pivoting itself as a sequel in name and a prequel in the grand timeline of the Red Dead world. Whisking us away to America’s frontier in 1899, this iteration actually precedes John Marston’s journey by 12 years, allowing for a decidedly different snapshot of the old west.The late 19th century isn’t exactly a period that’s explored all that often as it’s after the more popular Reconstruction and California Gold Rush eras. Under President William McKinley the mythos of the “wild west” is beginning to fade amid growing support for the temperance and progressive movements: in all, a fascinating glimpse into US history. Enter the outlaw Arthur Morgan, our “hero” and proponent of the famous Van der Linde crew, led by the unstable and sometimes well-meaning Dutch.As Dutch’s right-hand man at the height of the gang’s notoriety, you’re kind of a big deal from the get-go. Although we ultimately know what happens to the men in Dutch’s crew by way of Red Dead Redemption, what we get here is a master-crafted character study not unlike the one Vince Gilligan is currently giving us with Better Call Saul in the wake of Breaking Bad. Arthur isn’t quite as interesting as former protagonist Marston out of the gate. He’s less bombastic, more calculating in his thought process. In that way, he’s a better conduit for the player and more of a slow burn.The world around him is similarly grounded. Two of the cardinal sins of modern open world games are bloat and extreme gaminess, both of which frequently take you out of the fantasy. Ubisoft is mostly guilty of the former, filling maps to the brim with pins and forced points of interest to extend playtime. The latter is a transgression that many studios are guilty of in a misguided attempt to balance simulation and arcade fundamentals. Red Dead Redemption 2 never really falls into either of those traps. Now there are 144 cigarette card collectibles and plenty of small things to rummage around for if that’s your thing (as well as stamina and health “core” meters to manage), but bloat isn’t the focus.Comparably there are invisible or otherwise subtle meters that dictate anything from “honor” (how people react to you) to bonuses like more loot, but they’re not obvious. Red Dead Redemption 2 goes for the genuine undertaking of the facilitation of bromances with the camp system (which has flashes of Final Fantasy XV or the droves of relationship-centric JRPGs in recent memory) and backs up those relationships with strong mission design. More often than not you’re going to be saddling up with friends or new acquaintances, fighting, or running alongside them.You will be fighting quite a lot, which is arguably the best bit the game has to offer. Dead Eye (read: super slo-mo vision) returns and although the concept is as old as dust (17 years removed from Rockstar-published Max Payne), it allows for the further beautification of some of the more hectic confrontations (as does the first-person viewpoint). It also knows when to figuratively slow down. There’s a bunch of role-playing (RP) type things that will keep people busy for well over 100 hours. Fishing, poker, cosmetic alterations, that type of stuff. It’s never in-your-face, merely there if you want it.Rockstar threw an insane amount of money at the production of Red Dead Redemption 2 and it shows. There are scores of musical tracks helmed by the talented Woody Jackson, some of which are literally tuned to specific missions. Hell, it has roughly 200 different types of wildlife and each had unique sounds recorded for them. (I’d be remiss to not at least mention the crunch controversy and Rockstar’s response so that you can make up your own decisions, even if it didn’t directly impact this review.)So are all of these stats bullshit? Well in my effort to thoroughly dig through the massive 92GB file size (on PS4), they’re mostly justified. The key thing to remember is that Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just comprised of open ranges and fields. Each individual city feels full of life and the go-go nature of the story allows us to head into places like torched villages and snowy mountaintops. Amid all of those grand gestures, the smaller details matter too. There’s impressive penmanship on display within the pages of in-game journals when Rockstar could have gone with the easier route of a traditional typeface. Vendor menus look like a real Sears, Roebuck and Company catalogs.All of that does come at a small cost, like a several-minute load at the start and roughly 15-second restarts after failures/deaths. It sounds like no time at all, but it’s more about the parameters involved: you’ll mostly encounter the former condition as your paper-thin allies are killed, glitch into a bottomless pit, or get snagged by an invisible rock and fall off their horse, instantly failing a mission. Then there’s the typical open world snags like strange animations and odd physics that can cause instant deaths.The gear-swapping radial wheel can be finicky and not work exactly how you want it to. There’s also some silly moments that require suspension of disbelief; like when your crew robs someone wearing the same clothes they always wear, while calling you by your real name, and expecting not to be caught because they have small bandannas over their mouths. Those are all minor complaints and unlike some other open world games, don’t dominate or significantly break Red Dead Redemption 2.As I found myself wandering aimlessly for the umpteenth time, dealing with some of these random annoyances, it hit me why I was so connected to this world: Rockstar isn’t afraid to throw constant conflicts your way because they know the minute-to-minute gameplay can support it. Gunplay is fantastic (Rockstar has pretty much always nailed it), horse fundamentals are slick, random events/skirmishes keep things exciting, and the serene yet complex environments are the backbone for it all. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the epitome of ambition and like most things Rockstar, will meet the expectations associated with it. With all of the advancements since the last Red Dead and everything they’ve learned from Grand Theft Auto V under their belt, the series is in a better place, able to provide a more natural and less gamey world to explore.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. The online component is coming later this month and is not part of this assessment.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.
