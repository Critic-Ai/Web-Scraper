Eurogamer,"Dino crisis.Let's get one thing out of the way first: If you've enjoyed Horizon: Zero Dawn and are already looking forward to the sequel, there's likely only a very small chance you won't enjoy Forbidden West. Guerrilla Games made sure of that by giving you a game that is functionally identical to a lot of Zero Dawn. You will take on herds of machines so you can harvest them for parts. You will shoot animals for their hides. You will climb Tallnecks and rappel down. You will take out countless camps of near-identical human opponents. And, if you're anything like me, you will also take a lot of pictures - of swirling red sandstorms, snow-tipped mountains and views of sprawling forests. In truth, I can't calm down about the way Forbidden West looks. Someone made this, and you can walk around in it!All of these elements worked well before, and I expect many players to embrace Forbidden West just as they did in 2017 because of them. What I'm interested in, however, is change. Since this is a sequel, it feels fair to ask whether Forbidden West improves on elements that could have done with improving. I can recognise and appreciate that Guerrilla made attempts to address some common criticisms of the first game. However, in most cases these intended improvements don't actually improve a lot.The new map is once again a stunner. I got a lot of enjoyment from just discovering each new part of it and taking it in. I often made my own quiet moments - coming up to a star-studded sky after a night swim, or watching trees sway in a storm for a while before moving to the next objective. It's not an entirely bug-free journey at this point, but I consider most bugs I encountered to be minor and most should be fixed with the day one patch that arrived towards the end of the review period. (Side-quest progression bugs, due to an NPC not going where they're supposed to, cleared after reloading my save, and the rest of the bugs were camera or lighting-related, with music overlapping sometimes, plus some pop-in that's since been reduced by the patch.) Characters are almost always just as gorgeous as their surroundings. I especially live for the skin in this game. Aloy now has the ruddy cheeks of a perpetually pale redhead, and beautiful freckles, and I'm obsessed with the several different shades you can clearly distinguish on darker-skinned characters. There are still unnaturally moving, dead-eyed characters in sequences, likely due to not using mo-cap for everything, but even that is a lot less noticeable.As for what you do in this world, and with these characters? After a lengthy tutorial which establishes the basics, all bets are off.In short there is a discovery problem. New weapons and monsters are very often not organically introduced as part of the story, but come across as entirely optional, no matter how useful or exciting they could be to encounter as part of Aloy's adventure. This happened in the previous game, too, but now, you will often fight familiar monsters during the main quest, only to find new ones only outside of the critical path. This is a shame, particularly since the new weapons in particular are a lot of fun - bolt blasters, essentially the machine guns of the Horizon universe, are perhaps slightly overpowered, but make up for this by the slow reload times and weight, which influences Aloy's dodge. My personal favourite is the shredder disc, which functions like  a boomerang - if you manage to catch the disc twice after firing it, the third shot will explode on impact. But with Forbidden West's new elements, new potions and traps among them, comes a sense of being overwhelmed. I often went into the menu to switch outfits and weapons mid-fight despite the weapon wheel, or desperately thumbed through a large array of traps while running away from a monster. Since rarer versions of a particular weapon type don't just have improved stats but also fire different ammo, I was never comfortable with selling anything, and often stared at the screen just crunching numbers. The variety of weapons would ideally mean that players have the freedom to use whatever weapon they like best, but too many of them are expensive, or sold in unlikely places, to make that happen. I can't speak for the higher difficulties, but the fact that I just didn't need most of the new additions is part of why a lot of them felt like stuff, rather than useful new tools. Elsewhere it's the same story. You get to pick your skills from large skill trees with much better UI design now, for example, but the new skills themselves just didn't impact play for me - Forbidden West feels like a game that wants to be more than the original was, but in reality it can be played with the same skill set and items from its predecessor, and does not feel worse for it.  So why are they there? (In terms of more, more, more, however, I should mention the extensive list of accessibility features, including button layout customisation, vibration intensity settings, subtitles of different sizes and a long list of volume controls.)Food, which you can forage for and have someone make for you at a settlement, and a stash for items Aloy can no longer hold on her person, are two more new additions I didn't really know what to do with. Both are prime examples of RPG elements lifted from other games that just won't work in the context of Horizon. The world is so full of all kinds of stuff I didn't feel the need to access my stash. Usually I just didn't know what was in there, having forgotten how many times the game told me ""pouch full, sent to stash"". And, left with no easy way to check unless I wanted to travel back to a settlement and take a peek in there myself, it was easy to ignore. Granted, food may well make an impact at higher difficulty levels, but again you eventually carry so much of it that, ahead of a battle, I sat in the menu for minutes to crunch stats.Other improvements are equally troublesome. One frequent criticism of Zero Dawn were its many rather stupid human enemies. The main quest at least lowers that number, but of course you can still spend countless sidequests shooting at bandits. In Zero Dawn, I enjoyed nothing more than taking out entire camps stealthily. Granted, it was probably too easy - I could hop between tufts of tall grass, and lure half the camp to my position without anyone wondering why bodies were piling up right behind them. But in Forbidden West, I don't think enemies have become smarter - they still overwhelmingly remain standing in the same spot while you shoot at them, and tend to shoot the wall beneath you whenever you're in a slightly elevated position. But this time around, if one of them hears you, almost always all of them hear you. They can see you from what feels like miles away, and more often than not, very open level design completely forbids me from actually sneaking up on anyone, with tall grass often positioned in a way that makes it impossible to sneakily detonate blaze or acid cannisters. Additionally, any human opponent seems to be able to withstand some ten odd arrows. Monster battles meanwhile, in many ways the heart of Horizon, feel practically unchanged, probably because they worked fine the way they were. You can now fight several new types of monsters, including hippo-like Widemaws, something that looks like a coati and more dinosaur-adjacent creatures. I generally enjoy the battles and think they are exciting just due to how ferocious and big these machine animals are. But for the first time I noticed that just adding new types of monsters actually doesn't add variety to the fundamental gameplay - you still really just shoot a lot of arrows at them. For these encounters, too, the level design now just forbids some of the more tactical gameplay - in some areas I just wouldn't know where to put a tripcaster, or put a trap down without being seen.In terms of structure, Forbidden West's main quest structure is now much more geared towards visiting dungeons. I like that a lot more than visiting different cauldrons and killing everything inside (which of course you can still do) or tracking after the condescending know-it-all Sylens because otherwise you wouldn't know where to go. There is more of a clear goal to what you're doing this time around. You get coordinates to a place, navigate your way through it, fight a big monster and then get some computer bits at the end. The dungeons often look pretty cool, showcase Forbidden West's greatly improved climbing, and allow for some good indoor level design. There's much more climbing and pathfinding to do than before, and while it's never a challenge to find out where you need to go (because Aloy will tell you, as she never shuts up), I think there's a good mix here between climbing, scanning your surroundings and even swimming.A lot of what hasn't improved - or has, in places, become markedly worse - is connected to the story. Aloy travels west because she's trying to find a working copy of the sentient computer that's been running earth. Let's just sit with this sentence for a moment. Enjoying Horizon always meant accepting the inherent video game-y ridiculousness of its premise, but given how much work Guerrilla put into Horizon's world-building, I felt there was almost something akin to a balance there. It was fun to discover where things came from along with your protagonist, and the answers she found were silly but just believable enough.But that thrill of discovery is now mostly gone, and what we're left with is the story of a world that's dying because someone didn't debug it regularly. Much of Forbidden West's narrative issues are frustratingly embargoed, but know that at times it will go fully off the rails into wild, nonsensical sci-fi. Its ending is tedious and anticlimactic. Before you get there, you'll encounter some oddly pro-military cringe, oodles of ""don't ask"" logical leaps, and antagonists almost entirely devoid of personality and, strangely, screen time. Horizon Forbidden West is still evidently not a game that has anything of interest to say about its apocalypse... It's a game that exists to be looked at.In other words, Forbidden West successfully manages to undermine most of what was interesting and fun about Zero Dawn's story, because the deeper you look into things, the more you get confronted with pseudo, sci-fi fantasy stuff that even in a video game is difficult to take seriously - and oh, does it want to be taken seriously. Beyond the story, in Forbidden West Aloy herself is the real disappointment to me. She's now known as a saviour and a champion - soon even in the West, which at least provides an excuse for why everyone would ask her for help. But Saviour Aloy is also absolutely unbearable. She isn't just accepted, she's revered, and while she at least partially rejects that new status (""Varl, uh...helped""), she's also incredibly obnoxious all of a sudden. Aloy will repeatedly state what she needs to do, such as ""I need to go west, I need to go west,"" but she'll never explain to anyone why, only hinting, cryptically, at how she's the only one who can save the planet. The constantly sullen way in which Aloy says everything now becomes particularly difficult to bear at times, because she just sounds so done. That isn't a knock on Aloy's voice actress Ashly Burch, but on whatever process led to her being asked to perform this way, mumbling her way through every line and ending everything on an exhale so it sounds like a sigh. Meanwhile, Aloy's constant ""gotta go"" attitude leaves no time for other people's troubles - characters are frequently brushed off because they simply couldn't understand, but her character's urgency feels entirely fabricated when there's always time to hunt Pelicans and help a diplomat or two. Aloy recklessly endangers the people she's supposed to save, just to get her way, causing destruction and threatening murder in service of her mission, completely without remorse. This Aloy will kill you to save you, but before that she will belittle you and speak in technobabble. Granted, I did enjoy some of the multi-part sidequests, as they highlighted the day-to-day struggles of the new clans you meet - but here too, the number of recognisable characters has been greatly reduced, and the number of interesting female characters, a major part of what worked so well with Horizon Zero Dawn's storytelling, seems to have markedly and frustratingly reduced. What's more, narratively, almost the entire campaign is structurally identical. Usually some bureaucracy or another will keep Aloy from doing the thing she needs to do - like win some clan chief's trust, usually, again, by killing a lot of people - and then, only once she's done that, she can finally get her world saving done. It's a well-trodden criticism of the open world genre's storytelling issues, but a pertinent one, and one that Forbidden West does little to counter.As a woman with African roots, it was also startling to see Zulu face paint in the game being treated as a cosmetic, something you can get at a settlement for shards, as if it were fun Halloween makeup - completely removed from its cultural significance. As a result of all this, Horizon Forbidden West is still evidently not a game that has anything of interest to say about its apocalypse, brought about, essentially, by a few Silicon Valley idiots, other than ""look how pretty these holograms are"". It's a game that exists to be looked at.There are other frustrations. While Forbidden West is not a difficult game to understand, it acts like it is. Aloy will narrate your every move, and I mean every move (""I should scan this."" ""I fell off and need to find my way back up""), robbing you of all agency to discover anything for yourself. Characters will explain the same issue over and over, but feel like empty, quest-giving shells otherwise (also a frequent criticism of the first game). And again, there's the lingering sense of borrowing without meaning, without understanding the original context of what's being borrowed. To seemingly counter that issue of shallow side characters, for instance, Guerrilla once again lifts a mechanic from somewhere else - characters who accompany you for stretches of the main game and fight with you, God of War-style. I really like these people, and would give each of them their own main game over Forbidden West's Aloy immediately. They convene at a hub, Dragon Age: Inquisition-style, where you can watch them banter and ask them how it's going. This is again a good idea in practice that just doesn't, and won't, fit Forbidden West the way it does other games, as after characters arrive at the hub you don't take them with you again. They're just sitting in a large bunker, without much to say on your progress. I didn't get a lot of added value from it.It's a real shame. While it's undoubtedly another accomplished game in terms of technical achievement and sheer visual spectacle - I'm reminded again of those incredible faces, and one particularly outstanding underwater level - I've enjoyed Forbidden West less than Zero Dawn. The main story has major issues, and the level design made it difficult for me to play the way I had previously enjoyed, while making a lot of the newer systems feel redundant. Beyond that, the sense is of a game where Guerrilla has cobbled together RPG building blocks often without making them work within the context of its own game, and in some cases actively worsening Horizon Forbidden West as a result. I don't expect groundbreaking innovation, but with using well-established elements there's always the danger of them having been done better elsewhere. Unfortunately, with Horizon Forbidden West that's often the case.

The Forbidden West may have been forbidden just because it needs you so much - and I'm totally here for it.Release date: February 18, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4
Developer: Guerrilla Games
Publisher: Sony It builds on what was offered by Horizon Zero Dawn - an open world filled with quests to catch your attention, a strong story of post-post-apocalyptic life, robot dinosaurs, and technological mysteries. There was almost a concern that this sequel may feel too familiar, just teleported to a new map, but the opening hours alone were enough to alleviate those fears. Although the same framework is there and the core gameplay mechanics remain untouched, this truly is an evolution, a new beast fitted over the mechanical bones of the Old Ones.Regardless of whether the next quest you find is a smaller errand or core story mission, there's a depth and breadth to each one that's consistently surprising. What you'd expect to be a simple fetch quest is always much more than that, and someone you initially think is an incidental character becomes a recurring favorite you're desperate to see pop up again elsewhere. That's key to the experiences in the Forbidden West as the most immediate change is the improvements to the humans you'll find in this robotic world. While there were a handful of memorable characters in the original game, developer Guerrilla has made every single person you interact with in the sequel feel unique and interesting. Regardless of the time you spend with any NPC, each one has a distinct personality, a slither of backstory, and an interesting hook. There's a beautiful array of diversity here too, including non-binary representation and characters with disabilities, which is an interesting conversation to be had in a tribalistic world. The little touches make a difference too, like seeing anyone in the desert areas visibly glisten with sweat; while possibly the best facial capture in games to date allows for every look and smirk to come to life. There's a lot more humor and humanity on show here and it all aids how connected you feel to the world and its people in Horizon Forbidden West. Even the returning gameplay elements have had more personality injected into their metallic joints. Tallnecks return as a means of unfogging the gigantic map, with the huge giraffe-esque beasts dotted at different points around the Forbidden West. The original game's gimmick was just working out how to get to their heads in order to hack their geographical knowledge. But, this time around each of the majestic creatures gets its own little narrative quirk. Cauldrons too, the ancient robot manufacturing plants that you have to hack to gain the ability to take control of the dinos, all require a different approach. Dyes and face paints can be unlocked to customize Aloy further, while more machines can be overridden and commandeered than ever before. It helps to diversify your approach to combat too. Regardless of how powerful you get as Aloy - who's conveniently got into some ""trouble"" between games to explain the loss of all her advanced weaponry and power armor - the robot dinosaurs will always be king here. One bad move can be fatal against the toughest opponents, like the gigantic mammoth-inspired Tremortusks that have dominated the trailers for the game. Your only way of effectively taking them down is to plan, strategize, and make sure you've prepped, along with moving and attacking with as much caution as you can before the inevitable chaos quite literally reigns down on you. I love the fact that taking down the biggest machines is always a challenge; there's a difficulty curve at play that you never quite crest the top of. But it ensures that taking them down never feels anything but rewarding. Although the game does do a poor job of explaining some of the intricacies of its systems - particularly when it comes to the different ammo types, firing options, and the way to benefit best from its pretty complex skill tree. The new Valor system, which gives Aloy huge buffs and boosts to use in combat that can be switched out at will, is a welcome addition that always delights with its little cutscene triggers and liberal use of war paint. But, anyone who hasn't played the original game could well find themselves lost in the weaponry sub-systems. Another frustration is the climbing. It was said that the game offers 'free-climbing' with no limitations on where you can shimmy on up, but in reality, climbing is limited to secret handholds that you expose with a pulse of your focus. There's no consistency to where and when you can climb, and the button prompts to leap from handhold to handhold are clumsy and awkward. Accidentally flinging myself from the side of a skyscraper became a regular occurrence, with the movement occasionally becoming frustrating to the point of utter irritation. It's certainly not a patch on the smoothness of scaling the world that you'll find in something like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and that's such a shame when the world continually urges you to explore it. What always works though is how rewarding exploration feels. Like all of the best open-world games, there's always something to discover around the next horizon, with some areas locked off until you've obtained the right skill. There's always the subtle encouragement to revisit earlier areas to discover what you've missed, and because of the strength of the game's side quests and other narrative beats, you won't want to miss a single thing. The addition of swimming adds enhanced depth to the world, although it does come complete with its own dangers, and when the climbing does work it all blends to make you feel like you can go anywhere. At the center of it all is Aloy. Our returning heroine is just as compelling here as in the original game, if not more so because some of the struggles she has to overcome feel much more relatable this time around. The first game saw her as an outcast growing from child to young woman, just trying to find out where she came from. The discoveries she makes of Elisabeth Sobeck and the activities of the old ones become her driving force. But here, she's already armed with so much knowledge that it's the more human-level arc that really drives the story forward. Of course, there's a world to be fixed and big bads to be vanquished, but it's as much about fixing the world as it is about Aloy learning that the people of Earth are just as much worth saving as the planet itself. The journey she takes from being staunchly, almost repugnantly independent, to embracing the friends - old and new - that push their way into her life is quite unforgettable. More than once I found myself laughing out loud or fighting back a tear or two. What you end up with is a cast that both myself and Aloy would die for, which is complemented by the other adventures you've had along the way to saving the world. So compelling are they that you may well feel compelled to avoid the main story for fear of it all ending too quickly. I adore the more subtle developments too, like hearing the way the inhabitants of the Forbidden West react to Aloy's presence changes. Known initially by many names throughout the land, like Red, Savior of Meridian, and flame-haired, eventually you'll notice that her insistence at being called ""just Aloy"" starts to stick. It's a world you want to spend time in, and like Aloy, will want to protect at all costs. And did I mention that it's utterly stunning too? This is the first massive PS5 open world and the variation you'll find here will always have you reaching for the screenshot button. The neon lights of Las Vegas, the withering remains of San Francisco, the warning glow of a robot searching for you through the underwater reeds, it looks and feels magnificent to play. What Guerrilla Games has achieved here is nothing short of phenomenal. Story, gameplay, mechanics, and the world itself are all such an improvement on the original game - which in itself is a feat alone. The climbing, ironically, is the only thing that really holds it back from utter perfection, but it's not enough to make Aloy's latest story go without anything bar the highest recommendation. You know a game is good when the robot dinosaurs aren't the thing you want to talk to your friends about first. Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.

Metro GameCentral,"Sony’s first big exclusive of the year is a stunning looking sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn that adds more of everything, including robot dinosaurs.Publishers always complain about how hard it is to launch a brand new franchise, with the difficulty of getting people to try something new being the most common excuse for endless sequels. That’s fair enough, but 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn demonstrated that there’s one simple trick to getting people interested in your game: dinosaurs. Preferably giant robot ones.Add in state-of-the-art graphics and reassuringly familiar gameplay and, despite being a brand new IP, Horizon Zero Dawn managed to rack up an impressive 20 million sales. Its sequel will likely do just as well as it’s able to benefit from even better visuals, a now recognisable name and lead character, and a wider range of things to see and do.Although its list of new features is not necessarily very inspired, Horizon Forbidden West does take to heart complaints that the original was ultimately quite shallow and repetitive. There are no big new answers to these problems though, just an attempt to add depth and variety to each individual element. And while that means this sequel will never be accused of breaking new ground it does mean it’s an even more effective crowd-pleaser than before.On a conceptual level the setting of Horizon Forbidden West is fairly straightforward. It’s a post-apocalyptic action role-player where the world is inhabited by tribes of humans, using roughly medieval style technology, and robot animals (despite what we, and the marketing, might suggest the ones based on dinosaurs are in the minority).As odd as that sounds the games have fashioned a surprisingly clever explanation for why there are robot kangaroos and giant crabs wandering about shooting laser cannons at you. And while the most honest answer is because someone at developer Guerrilla Games must be a massive Zoids fan, the backstory of egomaniacal tech bros dooming mankind to near extinction is a surprisingly imaginative bit of sci-fi.Unfortunately, in complete contrast to the background lore, the actual storytelling is as dull as dishwater. Everything to do with tribal politics, which dominates the first two-thirds of the game, is completely uninteresting and made even more so because of the curiously tepid script which makes it impossible to care about any of the characters. Everyone, including protagonist Aloy, is written in a peculiarly drab, low-energy style that seems completely at odds with the eccentricity of the setting.Things do get more engaging later in the game, when new characters and story elements not present in the original are brought to the fore, but the two halves of the storytelling equation still fail to balance out.In terms of the gameplay, there is no such unevenness. Even if Guerrilla Games is relatively new at this, having previously been best known for the Killzone series, Sony’s first party producers are past experts at third person, narrative-driven open world games. So it’s no surprise to find that the platforming works very much like Uncharted, the role-playing elements are reminiscent of God Of War, and the stealth is… like the stealth in any big budget game since the Batman: Arkham days.From a certain point of view these could all be viewed as negatives but being unoriginal is not in itself a sin, especially when Forbidden West goes to a lot of effort trying to hide the fact with its unique setting. It would have been nice if the platforming involved anything other than vaguely pushing in the direction you want to go but with so many other systems in play that was never going to happen.Likewise, the role-playing elements, which mostly revolve around upgrading your weapons and armour, can often seem – as in God Of War- to be unnecessary complications, included purely to give the illusion of depth. But if you’re not interested in them, they can be largely ignored if you just stick to using weapons given as rewards for completing missions. Increasing the size and complexity of the skill trees is certainly a positive move though, since most of the new skills also deepen other elements of the game.The combat is still quite simple, with only a few basic combos, but if you pay attention to the training challenges you can get quite creative, chaining moves together and mixing both melee and ranged attacks. Machine enemies have various components that can be shoot off to use or trade later, and these are often vulnerable to specific environmental attacks. So matching the right weapon to the right part creates an almost Pokémon style tactical dynamic, that means it’s almost impossible to take down large creatures if you’re not planning ahead.These larger scale fights are consistently the most entertaining part of the game, as you scope out the battlefield, setting traps and taking out human enemies, before making your move. One of the first really big set pieces involves a giant robot elephant, which seems almost invulnerable at first but can be lured towards cannisters of freezing gas or into the path of falling boulders, but which can also destroy all the buildings in the vicinity and kill you in almost one shot.It’s only at this point that we realised the game world is a lot more destructible than we first realised, as while it is undeniably beautiful it can still feel curiously sterile and artificial, despite the state-of-the-art visuals. Although perhaps that’s partly the odd camera angle the game has settled for, which by default is just a bit too close, and with too narrow a field of view, to feel entirely natural.Zero Dawn was released only a few days before Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and most of the comparisons between the two went in Nintendo’s favour. The most obvious influence on Forbidden West is that it now also has a paraglider (in addition to a new grappling hook) but the scale and intricacy of the world design suggests that Guerrilla has been studying more than just the surface features of Nintendo’s classic.While all of Forbidden West’s gameplay elements have been expanded upon from the original the most successful improvement is in terms of the side content. There’s a huge range of different missions and activities to involve yourself in, from an entirely self-contained board game to machine races, scavenger contracts, enemy bases to liberate, and errands to run. Most of these are already quite substantial but those labelled as actual side missions even more so.Given the complaints levelled against Zero Dawn, Guerrilla have clearly looked to the likes of The Witcher 3 for inspiration and so side missions are frequently just as long and uniquely designed as the story ones. None of them are just ‘go here and kill this person/thing’ and if it weren’t for the lifeless script it really would be giving CD Projekt Red a run for their money.Our favourite category of side content though is the puzzle sections based around old world ruins, which are basically the equivalent of shrines from Breath Of The Wild. There aren’t that many of them, but they do have proper puzzles that we genuinely struggled with a couple of times. Some of the other side content, like clambering atop a Tallneck (a robot giraffe) to fill in your map for the surrounding area, can also be surprisingly tough and while Aloy just talks you through what to do in story missions we appreciated the fact she doesn’t usually in the optional missions.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationA game like Horizon Forbidden West is unashamedly mainstream in its ambitions and many will still accuse it of being too shallow and formulaic. Neither complaint is without foundation but the only element we ever really got frustrated with is the disappointing enemy artificial intelligence, which feels at least two generations behind the curve and makes the stealth elements in particular far too mechanical.In terms of everything else robotics related, Horizon Forbidden West is entirely on point, with some fantastic art design, a beautiful looking open world, and such a variety of activities and locations (including a new focus on underwater areas) that the humdrum storytelling never comes close to spoiling it. This bigger, better, more approach does make it hard to see how a third game would work without a more through overhaul but for now this is one of the best open world adventures of recent years.In Short: A solid sequel to the crowd-pleasing original, which still doesn’t make enough of its unique setting but manages to add an impressive amount of depth to its combat and side content.Pros: A huge range of things to see and do, with versatile combat options, varied mission design, and even some decent puzzles. Excellent graphics, from both a technical and art design perspective.Cons: All the individual gameplay elements have been seen before in dozens of other games. Disappointingly dull script and characters.

Game Informer,"Horizon Zero Dawn was just the introduction to Guerrilla Games’ fascinating world and the unlikely hero who would do everything in her power to save it. The sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, takes everything to an exciting new level with its novel mechanics and riveting lore. Guerrilla Games improves on the last game’s shortcomings and isn’t afraid to borrow popular features from other big-name series, like Uncharted, Mass Effect, and Assassin’s Creed. The result is a game that’s not only fun to play, but full of surprises and wonder. Zero Dawn was a great proof of concept, but Forbidden West shows Guerrilla Games still has plenty of thought-provoking and compelling places to take Aloy’s adventures.Forbidden West picks up six months after the events of Zero Dawn. Aloy’s discoveries have only brought more questions and dangers her way, forcing her to head west for answers. With a few returning characters and plot tie-ins from the first game, Forbidden West isn’t ideal for newcomers who want to embrace the narrative. Guerrilla’s writers expertly expand upon Horizon’s rich lore and dive into the series’ sci-fi elements, which are the sequel’s most gripping aspects. Some of the most fun I had was piecing together Aloy’s journey, but certain revelations and “ah ha” moments aren’t as satisfying without the full context from the first game. The overall narrative kept me engaged, but certain parts feel rushed, and I was disappointed that villainous characters like Regalla are not given more time to shine.In the last entry, Aloy’s journey was often solitary, but Forbidden West makes other characters central to her success, which is a nice change of pace. Returning faces like Varl and Erend get to show more of their personalities, and newcomers like the kindhearted Zo and tragic warrior Kotallo have interesting backstories that explain their tribes’ beliefs and values. To make these burgeoning relationships more authentic, Aloy establishes a home base, a la Mass Effect, where she can talk to her companions about new developments in the main quest, learn their thoughts about one another, and get to know them more on a personal level. I loved watching the base populate with new members and seeing new areas open within it. If anything, I wanted more time to hang out with the characters. It was that fun to be around them and listen to their banter. The world is the star of the show. Forbidden West is a technical marvel, with breathtaking vistas, vibrant underwater corridors, and lush jungles. Every locale has its own flavor; just wait until you see Las Vegas. Traversal has been greatly improved, with smoother climbing mechanics and a new tool called the Shield Wing, which acts almost like a futuristic umbrella to let you descend from great heights. However, the world’s constant sense of discovery really had me glued to my controller. Forbidden West is a much bigger game than its predecessor, featuring an impressive number of quests and items to uncover. The story-focused side quests add so much to the lore that I never wanted to miss one, as they provided great insight into the tribes. One side quest forced me to pick between two imperfect characters vying to lead a tribe, while another had me battling the most vicious combination of machines flying on top of a Sunhawk.The side content also allowed me to unlock new locales and dungeons, and this doesn’t even factor in the additional activities like clearing rebel camps, climbing Tallnecks to reveal more of the map, and exploring Cauldrons for new machine overrides. I wasn’t expecting such a dense and vast world, and I always felt like I had something to do. Side quests offer great rewards, making them worth your while – some of my best weapons and armor came from these pursuits. I especially enjoyed revisiting settlements to see how some of the environments and their residents changed due to my actions. And as a nice touch, even more side quests would open regularly.Battles are still adrenaline-pumping affairs, and the satisfaction of besting monstrous machines never dissipates. You can expect more destructibility and bigger setpieces for fights, and I loved how the variety in the locales, from fighting in close quarters to rocky areas with plenty of places for cover, kept things fresh with new strategies to consider. Forbidden West allows you to embrace your own playstyle, offering many ways to get the upper hand on machines. This has its advantages and disadvantages. I loved the creativity at my disposal, like shooting weapons off machines and using them against the enemy or causing chain reactions with specific elements to cause big explosions. But at the same time, I never felt a growing sense of power that keeps combat interesting over time, and a lot of this comes down to my disappointment in the skill trees.The abilities you learn via the skill trees feel more like tiny perks than exciting upgrades. For instance, you can unlock the ability to set up traps faster, more potent potions, and extra ranged damage alongside weapon techniques that do anything from guaranteeing a knockdown shot to increased shredder damage. The best addition to the skill trees is Valor Surges, which are special attacks you tactfully unleash. I wish there were more of these abilities to experiment with, because once I unlocked and fully upgraded the radial blast, which triggers a powerful AoE shockwave, I never found another that felt as valuable. Some others include dealing more damage with melee attacks for a limited time and a damage-absorbing energy shield. That being said, the skill trees were so inconsequential to my success that I let my skill points pile upward of 10 without even touching them.Thankfully, the game is full of worthwhile improvements that make for a better experience, from a cleaner HUD to less inventory management. My favorite enhancements were being able to use Aloy’s focus to see climbing points and her ability to tag specific machine parts in a different color for easier targeting. The latter comes in handy for key upgrade resources, as certain machine components are crucial to upgrade your armor and weapons. Upgrades are a greater time investment as a result, and I grew tired of fighting the same machines repeatedly. As far as performance, I ran into a few minor glitches alongside some poor A.I. pathing and bad checkpoints, but none of these were significant issues that caused me much frustration. I was actually impressed by how smooth the game played considering its size and scope.Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon’s fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it’s an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights.

GameSpot,"Horizon Forbidden West sometimes packs in so much that it gets in its own way, but the many well-drawn characters populating its quests keep it compelling.By 
    Phil Hornshaw
   on February 14, 2022 at 12:01AM PSTHorizon Forbidden West can be daunting in its size and scope. That feeling only grows as you uncover its map, collect gear to fill in its giant arsenal of weapons and armors, or unlock a huge number of special moves, skills, and passive buffs from its expansive, revamped skill tree. But while it casts an imposing shadow, Forbidden West often keeps its focus on characters and their stories, and that approach works to break the enormity into smaller chunks and give your adventure stakes that matter. The game is continually compelling not because developer Guerrilla Games filled it with a huge amount of stuff to do, but because so much of that stuff is thoughtfully constructed and sometimes even emotionally engaging, instead of just feeling like items created to add as many map markers to the world as possible.Forbidden West picks up almost immediately after the end of its predecessor, Horizon Zero Dawn, and its DLC add-on, Frozen Wilds, and it expects you to be very familiar with protagonist Aloy's adventures from back in 2017. It's set in the distant future after the world as we know it has ended and humans have reverted to a tribalistic society scattered across the ruins of the United States. And roaming all around the world are giant robotic animals, some as big as dinosaurs, that kill humans on sight.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Horizon Forbidden West ReviewThe big issue driving the action is that, although Aloy defeated the rogue artificial intelligence Hades in the last game, it left lasting damage to the planet's biosphere. Aloy is hunting for ancient tech to fix the problem and stop a blight that's creeping across the land, threatening everyone with slow starvation, and the search takes her into the Forbidden West. A whole bunch of major and minor players from Zero Dawn are involved in some way or another, including Sylens, the semi-antagonistic voice on Aloy's radio throughout the first game, and it's easy to get a little lost in exposition and dialogue if you're not up on all the events, relationships, and machinations that took place in Forbidden West's predecessor.Since Aloy is a hunter in a hunter-gatherer society, collecting components to craft gear is a huge part of the experience, both for improving your equipment and for keeping you stocked for battle. Part of what makes you so effective in the Horizon games is Aloy's Focus, a remnant of old-world technology that allows her to interface with computers, see things others can't, and gather information on enemies. Combat is all about spotting machine weak points and using various kinds of weapons and crafted ammo to strip away armor, while inflicting status effects such as setting enemies on fire, bathing them with corrosive acid, or freezing them to make their metal bodies brittle.In a lot of ways, Forbidden West is pretty much the same as Zero Dawn, but it follows the common sequel ethos of ""more and bigger,"" and a lot of the systems have been improved and expanded. The Horizon games include climbing and environmental puzzles like those you'd see in Assassin's Creed or Uncharted, but more of Forbidden West's world is scalable than in Zero Dawn, allowing you to reach the tops of mountains or ruins--although this isn't The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and there are still plenty of things you can't climb. The freedom still improves traversal quite a bit, however, as does a powered grapple that you can use to reach specially marked points, a glider that lets you get down from those high places quickly, and the ability to swim and explore submerged environments.Your arsenal is larger, with a host of different kinds of weapons and elemental ammo types for straight combat, plus a series of craftable traps that you can use to take down machines and enemies before they spot you. There's so much it can be hard to keep straight, in fact. You get various bows, slingshots, and launchers, ammo for all of them that deliver different elemental status effects, plus traps of various types and effectiveness. You can craft ammo on the fly in combat if you have the pieces you need, whether it's regular arrows, freezing bombs, or explosive javelin spikes, and all of your many weapons are upgradeable if you have the right components. It all incentivizes you to scan every robot for useful pieces, dig through every heap of salvaged metal, and open every thousand-year-old tackle box in case you might need what's inside.Six huge skill trees replace Zero Dawn's much more modest four, each focused on a single element of Aloy's arsenal, such as trapping, hacking, ranged combat, or stealth. The skills you can unlock include passive buffs and active special moves that correspond to specific weapon types. There's also a new set of Valor abilities for Aloy that are similar to the ""ultimates"" you might see in something like Overwatch or Apex Legends. One Valor ability lets you turn on active camouflage to go invisible and escape a bad situation; another amps up your ability to slice off machine parts with your weapons; a third just creates a blast of electricity around you to send enemies flying. You can only equip one Valor ability at a time once you've unlocked it, and you have to charge it up through combat in order to use it.Again, it is a lot of stuff to keep track of, and the sheer volume works against Forbidden West as often as it works for it. Most of the time, though, it's not super clear whether the Uncommon Shredder launcher a merchant is selling is an upgrade over the Uncommon Shredder launcher you already have--lots of weapons have similar stats, or one will offer acid ammo instead of fire ammo, making the decision between them feel overly granular and not particularly important. The limits on how much stuff you can carry are pretty high, so you'll quickly end up with lots of slightly different weapon variations. With so many ammo types in the game, you wind up just carrying a bunch of weapons to cover all the elemental bases, while not really caring about any of them. It's only late in the game, when you start to find some demonstrably sick weapons, that the arsenal feels like anything more than just a pile of junk in your backpack you have to dig through until you find a bow that shoots the right kind of arrows for a given situation.The massive skill tree presents the same problem. Valor abilities can be great in a pinch, giving you some next-level power when you really need it, but there are two to unlock on each skill tree and the use cases for some aren't nearly as clear as ""emergency invisibility cloak"" or ""30 seconds of souped-up arrows."" The same goes for the huge number of special abilities, which amounts to three for each weapon type. Some are game-altering strategy centerpieces, like the Knock-Down Shot, but others are easy to forget about, like a skill that makes your slingshot bomb more powerful if it bounces on the way to your target. With both skill and Valor abilities, you'll probably unlock one or two you like and stick with those for most of the game.That's also an issue with the flow of combat. Forbidden West gives you more options in a fight, but it doesn't really change battles fundamentally from Zero Dawn. It just throws more ingredients into the stew. You'll usually sneak into a situation where a bunch of robots or humans are gathered, moving from tall grass patch to tall grass patch to either set traps, snipe enemies, or pull off sneaky executions. Once you've tipped off the machines to your presence, though, combat can feel flaily. Enemies have a tendency to attack quickly and relentlessly, and your only defensive recourse is a dodge roll to get out of harm's way, since melee combat remains mostly a hit-and-run option that's not especially satisfying. So when a Scrapper or a Widemaw charges, you're dodging attack after attack, hoping to get a little distance to draw an arrow and get a shot off before you go back to fleeing for your life.It's also frustrating trying to dig through your (other) stupidly large bag of traps and potions to find an item that can heal you or cancel status effects as, again, you're being chased down by an apartment building-sized predator. It's worth noting that you can customize that bag to lessen the options in it--something that is essential if you want to find something important in the heat of the moment--but it doesn't change the fact that Aloy has so much gear and so many options that a lot of Forbidden West's good ideas about combat, stealth, trapping, and crafting get in the way of each other.But when you're able to make Aloy's various tools and abilities come together, it creates some harrowing and exciting battles. That's especially true when you're able to make a plan with stealth, traps, and tactics, and execute that plan. It helps that, while you'll fight a lot of battles alone, quite a few encounters will see you aided by other characters. Having an extra bow and more targets for machines to chase lessens the pressure, and characters routinely chuck Aloy extra ammo to keep the fight going.And really, it's those other characters that will keep you going through Forbidden West as much as the opportunity to explore a fascinating ruin or fell a rampaging robo T-rex. Often you'll meet up with someone from a local tribe who has a vested interest in checking out that long-dormant agricultural testing facility or space travel research lab, and it's in building relationships with these characters and learning about their various peoples that Forbidden West really shines.While Aloy herself is kind of dull--she's like Batman if he wasn't also Bruce Wayne, just somberly wandering around thinking about the next death-defying action she has the duty to undertake, all while speaking out loud every little thing she thinks--Forbidden West puts her in an almost Mass Effect-style position of building a team of people to help her save the world. About a third of the way into the game, you establish a stable base of operations, and characters both old and new become mainstays. You don't bring them out into the field as a unit like an RPG team, but you can head back to talk with them about what you learn and your experiences, and they'll often pair up with you at key moments or ask your help with side quests that are important to them. The group grounds Forbidden West's story by making it feel more personal, while giving you a reason to care about what's happening in local events.Side quests, too, are populated by interesting people with relatable problems and motivations, and Forbidden West does a great job of giving you things to do that don't feel like repetitions of the open world ""go here, get this"" quest template. Often, side quests involve several steps or multiple missions, forcing Aloy to intervene in local politics or help with dire situations. In one series of missions, you wind up interacting with the leaders of two desert villages, each with differing views about the future of the larger tribe and distrusting the other. Both are likable but flawed characters, and as you spend a little time helping and getting to know them, you realize that neither is wholly right or wrong. When you're ultimately forced to try to mediate their dispute or choose a side, the time you've spent keeps you invested in the situation's resolution and makes your involvement in it feel important.Forbidden West is full of moments like this, where the game goes out of its way to put you in close contact with a side character for a bit, and then turns them into the fulcrum of a compelling quest. Paired with the stakes of the overall main story, this gives the whole game the feeling that you're not just running around doing errands for people; you're actually building important relationships with people you've come to know and respect. And while there are an absolute truckload of side quests, plus smaller jobs to do, the fact that so many are so well-written or offer a deeper look into Forbidden West's world makes them all worth doing.Guerrilla is usually also good at keeping its various map-filling activities feeling fresh and diverse. The game contains a number of ""relic ruins"" sites, in which you explore a decrepit ancient building looking for an artifact locked in a hard-to-reach place. There are a bunch of these, but I stopped to do each one because they're fun and complex climbing puzzles that are all very distinct from the others. The same goes for the Tall Necks, the giant robot dinosaurs that serve the map-revealing function of towers in other open-world games. Reaching the top of each lumbering robot is a puzzle unto itself; one is submerged in the ocean and requires you to find components to rebuild it, for instance, and another can't be reached until you knock it over by shooting giant ballistas at it. The general goal is always to get to the top of a Tall Neck, but each challenge is so different from the others that they're absolutely worth chasing down as soon as you reach a new area.The main story also has its share of standout moments. One portion concerns helping the leader of the Tanakth tribe to put down a rebellion so he can make attempts at peace and cooperation with the eastern tribes. Another takes you into a submerged underground Las Vegas strip to help some salvagers realize their dream of elevating their traveling storytelling act with technological wonders. The story can be uneven at times, but it's often good at keeping the focus on smaller-scale stakes that feel like they actually matter to the people involved.The storytelling is aided by the fact that Forbidden West is absolutely gorgeous on PlayStation 5, in both its graphics-focused or performance-focused modes. Everything, from the characters and their intricately constructed armor, to the rusting ruins of cities with rebar jutting out of concrete, to the lush jungles and wind-swept deserts, is impressively detailed. Catching a sunrise over the farms of Plainsong or the waves of Landfall is legitimately beautiful, and the colorful, diverse locations offer vista after stunning vista everywhere you look. It's a very pretty game.Characters, meanwhile, benefit from a great deal of strong voice work and what seems like an abundance of scanned facial performances, if not outright full motion capture. You'll spend a large amount of time in conversations in Forbidden West, and in the main quest and big side quests, the characters are often compelling because their facial performances are so good. This has a drawback, though--you'll definitely notice the less-important folks who move like animatronics, and in some interactions on lesser missions, Aloy has a tendency to look all over the place, as if her animation isn't quite matched to that particular conversation or circumstance. For the big and important moments, though, a ton of characterization and emotion comes through in the faces, and it makes the stories and emotional beats of the game all the more interesting.The vast size of Forbidden West also feels like it introduces a fair few technical issues beyond Aloy's occasional inability to make eye contact with less-interesting characters. Especially when you're on a mount or looking over large distances, there can be some texture pop-in, particularly with the architecture of settlements. The game crashed to the PlayStation dashboard on me a few times as I played through it, and once or twice, a quest couldn't be completed until I reloaded an earlier save. Aloy got stuck looting a chest or an enemy a few times, forcing me to roll back to an earlier save. While these issues sound frustrating, they were spread over dozens of hours and only ever ended up being a minor inconvenience thanks to Forbidden West's liberal autosaves, so I never lost much, if any, progress. A day one patch seems to have ironed out a few of the pre-release issues I experienced, but while some have been lessened, like the texture pop-in problem, they haven't been eliminated.Overall, though, Horizon Forbidden West does a lot more right than it does wrong. It might be jam-packed with stuff to see, do, know, and remember, but when its many systems come together, it can be a beautiful, exciting, and delightful open-world experience. The story that drives you through the frontier is often well-told and does well to center actual characters rather than audio logs, and while the map is littered with icons, it's much more often that they're fun, skillfully crafted diversions than random busywork to fill a checklist. There's a huge amount to do and see in Horizon Forbidden West, and the great majority of it is worth doing and seeing thanks to strong writing, great visuals, and some marked improvements to the series' underlying ideas.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Returning to Aloy’s machine-threatened world is well worth the wait I still remember the moment when Horizon Zero Dawn opened up past Nora territory, and I took my first steps into the vast wilderness. I went slack-jawed as I roamed red rock plateaus, admiring the topographical fidelity to the natural world. All of it was filled with robotic foes, which I fought with just bows, arrows, and a spear. I played every quest, completed every Hunting Ground; I got the Shield Weaver armor, and collected most of the metal flowers; I played through the Frozen Wilds expansion. Three years later, I went on a road trip through Utah and Colorado, to see this part of America myself.Horizon Forbidden West has delivered on the promise of more on just about every level. It’s a buffet you might graze on forever, filled with quests, characters, encampments, environments, and collectibles — and battles against new deadly machines. The game’s many expanded traversal tools and combat options deeply enrich the time you spend in this gorgeous, nearly photo-real wilderness. But Forbidden West also stumbles over this “more is better” ethos. Both mechanically and narratively, it suffers under the weight of its sequel ambitions, trying too hard to be grand, and sometimes losing sight of its strong world-building and storytelling heart. That said, Aloy is still a character I love, and her world is one I enjoyed spending time in — and one I plan to explore indefinitely.Horizon Forbidden West, especially on the PlayStation 5, is breathtaking; it’s one of the most impressively realized wilderness games I’ve ever played. On PS5, you can regularly walk from interiors right into the wide world, without loading screens. This gives players incredible freedom in their journey westward, exploring gorgeous vistas bursting with giant sequoias, expansive lakes, and crumbling ruins swallowed by desert sands. Joshua trees and scrub-speckled flatlands give an immediate sense of place — and Forbidden West even lets players explore decaying ruins of actual American cities. These landmarks punctuate Forbidden West’s story about climate crises and the excesses of the ruling class. Though the last game ended with a battle against the rampant AI Hades, humanity’s victory did not repair the lethal machines that were originally part of a terraforming project meant to save the Earth. The off-kilter system has created unstable weather patterns, blighted farmlands, and polluted waterways — and Guerrilla Games’ overgrown rendition of the West Coast is a plausible projection of our real-world climate degradation.Aloy’s expanded traversal tools, while flawed, greatly aid the player in exploring this world. The developers took obvious cues from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, adding a glider to Aloy’s toolkit and more handholds for her to climb on. In Forbidden West, Aloy can scale mountains, the peaks of which offer grand rewards: a gorgeous view, a height advantage against enemies, and the opportunity to glide over ravines and rolling pastures alike. Swimming is also a singular joy, once you’ve unlocked a tool that allows for infinite underwater breathing. I’ve spent hours watching swimming machines, and exploring the richness of marine life clinging to crumbling buildings. With Forbidden West’s better fast travel system — it’s free to travel between discovered campfires, while traveling from anywhere to a campfire costs one fast travel pack — this all weaves into a rich exploration experience, whether you’re fast-traveling or running from place to place, enjoying the abundance of the world around you.In Horizon Forbidden West, I’m constantly switching between the 60 fps and 4K graphics modesBut despite the creativity of Aloy’s new traversal tools, their uneven execution dampens some of the fun. Handholds are often not marked — by default, you pulse your Focus to reveal them — and not all surfaces are climbable, which can be frustrating. It’s especially difficult when navigating enclosed spaces, and when the margin for error is slim; a fall means repeating an entire platforming sequence. Early swimming challenges are often disorienting, with hard-to-see visual cues. The grappling hook is full of potential, but it’s mostly used to dislodge vent covers, and often requires players to time jumps perfectly. In a game so obsessed with the joy of exploration, it’s all the more heartbreaking to adhere to environmental puzzles’ single-track solutions.When freed from the confines of caves and laboratories, Forbidden West thrives — especially when Aloy flexes her skills as a hunter. New machines are fearsome and deadly, and a treat to fight or override: There are giant boars and rattlesnakes, as well as terrifying mammoths and Triceratops-esque robots. As in Zero Dawn, taking them down requires scanning for weak points and removing crucial components. In keeping with its expanded navigation tools, Forbidden West also introduces new weapons and traps. Collecting an arsenal of sharpshot bows gave me more freedom to develop a sniper strategy around tearing off canisters, then taking down beasts with acid, flame, or frost. The game also largely scraps the rote human-enemy fights of Zero Dawn. A rebel faction has learned to override machines, and fighting humans atop the backs of Chargers requires rethinking stealth strategies entirely.However, the game doesn’t do a great job of teaching takedown tactics. Zero Dawn walked players through using a Thunderjaw’s disc launcher against it, while Forbidden West cues players to fire elemental arrows and try traps, without offering a more cohesive combat strategy for larger, scarier enemies. This can make such machines, like the aforementioned mammoths, feel like a confounding spike in difficulty.Forbidden West’s struggle to teach the finer points of combat might just be because there are so many ways to fight. Players who aren’t so keen on stealth have more options now — for example, expanded melee combos make the spear much more viable. There are six perk trees, with a wealth of unlockable skills (thankfully, some of Aloy’s best skills from Zero Dawn, like Silent Strike, are defaults in Forbidden West). But it can all feel like a deluge. These skill trees are detailed, and even include a new special attack called a Valor Surge. This is in line with the broader abundance of additional options, from bows to armor to cooked meals to the game’s new crafting tables.This is all to say that Forbidden West gives players a lot to play with — and it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture, even as the story keeps raising the stakes about Earth’s predicament. Still, it wasn’t what I focused on. Forbidden West told me that Aloy had limited time to save the planet from famine. But I screwed around hunting wild machines, and wasted an hour shooting some 20 lizards to get their “wild meat” for an upgrade to my quiver. I made time to replace an overworked cook’s favorite griddle, and to deliver a flower to a “forbidden” lover. I did melee pit challenges, went on errands, fought through cauldrons, and picked apart rebel outposts. I involved myself deeply in the concerns of my fellow people, and gained companions that altered my perception of this beautiful world. My attachment to these comrades led me to other settlements, full of specific concerns like labor disputes and simple personal spats, along with the ever-present machine threat. Forbidden West hits its stride when Aloy is engaging with settlements and tribal communities, and investing in her companion characters. These aren’t story quests I had to play along Aloy’s journey — but they’re the ones I chose to anyway. The companions aren’t very useful in a fight, but that didn’t make me love them any less. They’re vital in a game where you’re a hero who has to save the world. These relationships convey a world worth saving, far more than the main storyline really does.At the same time, Forbidden West continues the series’ depiction of a post-racial society, while also borrowing aesthetics from various cultures — Zero Dawn received fair criticism for appropriating Indigenous cultures in its tribal designs, as well as using the term “Braves.” (In Zero Dawn, you learn that the AI function Apollo, which contained records of human history, was destroyed. This ostensibly allows the world to start fresh, free of the racism of the present day.) While the racial diversity of the Horizon games feels like progress in the context of AAA games more broadly, it’s at odds with how race, ethnicity, and culture are borrowed here without being discussed, or even acknowledged. I may have missed audio logs or journal entries that explain these issues, but that reinforces the idea that they aren’t core to the story. In the end, this is Aloy’s story: She continues to be a headstrong protagonist, and I say that admiringly. In Forbidden West, she takes no shit — but she also learns valuable lessons about accepting help, and about acknowledging the grief that comes from growing up as an outcast. She goes to bat for the people she cares about. Forbidden West homes in on the contrast between her convictions and those of Dr. Elisabet Sobeck, the creator of the Zero Dawn project that set the whole series in motion, and the character from whom Aloy was cloned. Where Sobeck took the destruction of humanity as an assumption, and worked to repopulate the Earth, Aloy fights for the survival of those who are alive today. Even as the story throws in twists and additional characters that alter the scope of the threat she’s up against, her steadfast resolve remains. Getting to play as her — in such a beautiful and densely packed world — is a journey I won’t walk away from anytime soon.

Kotaku,"For a game about exploring the unknown, Horizon Forbidden West sure plays it safe.Horizon Forbidden West follows directly in the path etched by its predecessor, 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn. It’s an open-world role-playing game set a thousand years from now, in a version of America covered in rust, rubble, and robot dinosaurs. On your adventures, you clear dozens of bandit outposts, open hundreds of treasure chests, craft yourself an armory of battle-ready gear, and assist various folks who need assistance in various ways. You do all this as a young woman named Aloy (voiced by Ashly Burch), whose impeccable archery skills form the foundation of the action. You’ve done this all before.Make no mistake: Despite its comfortably familiar trappings, Horizon Forbidden West is a tour de force. Its sprawling world feels alive with a tangible vigor many open-world games can only dream of. Not since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt have I played side-quests as invariably engrossing as these. In moments of downtime, Forbidden West features a fully optional tactical mini-game that’s so captivating I almost had to ask for an extension on this review because I kept getting side-tracked (we’ll get to that). In the busier moments, the core offerings—running, jumping, climbing, gawking slack-jawed at giant robot dinosaurs, then shooting those robot dinosaurs with an inventive arsenal of bows and arrows—are a blast from tip to tail.It’s a technological marvel to boot, too. In every frame, Horizon Forbidden West is a delectable feast for the eyes, at least on PlayStation 5, unseating last year’s Xbox racer Forza Horizon 5 as the best-looking console game in the neverending arms race of graphical fidelity. Pre-release coverage restrictions (Sony provided Kotaku with a PS5 copy of Horizon Forbidden West under condition of embargo) limit us to publishing 20 screenshots before launch. I’ll be frank, a small part of me wanted to just publish a post headlined “Here Are 20 Screenshots Of Horizon Forbidden West” and call it a day. This game is that beautiful—and, yes, for all you digital photogs, there’s a robust photo mode you can avail yourself of at any moment.But it’s hard not to feel a twinge of disillusionment amid the splendor, much like the diminishing thrills you get when vacationing in the same place for a return trip. Horizon Zero Dawn was a revelation. Horizon Forbidden West is a refinement.Horizon Forbidden West picks up several months after the events of Zero Dawn. Turns out, the big bad of that game—a malevolent artificial intelligence program known as HADES—wasn’t quite as defeated as Aloy was led to believe, but was exactly as undefeated as players were led to believe via Zero Dawn’s post-credits stinger. Also: the world is probably gonna end as a result. On word from her kinda-friend-kinda-not Sylens (Lance Reddick, who delivers all of his lines…like so), the solution to Aloy’s dilemma lies westward, past the confines of the charted world. So that’s where she goes.Key to this western realm, and to Forbidden West’s multi-plotline story, is a factionalized nation known as the Tenakth. The Tenakth maintain a tenuous peace with the principalities of the first game: the Carja, the Oseram, and so on. But their leader, Hekarro, is grappling with a rebellion spearheaded by his former lieutenant, Regalla (the inimitable Angela Bassett), which threatens that peace.Following her heroics in Zero Dawn, Aloy has attained a sort of messiah-like status, which allows her to do pretty much whatever she wants and go pretty much wherever she wants to go. People treat her with reverent awe and acquiesce to her requests, praising her as the “savior.” One major city centers a prominent district around a statue of Aloy carved from gold. (“The sculptor wanted to go even bigger,” one character remarks.) But Aloy doesn’t have the time nor the patience for any of that. She just wants to save the world.Alas, there is one place Aloy can’t just wander into unfettered: the west. You see, the west is, as the game’s title so aptly describes, forbidden (oh-ho!). The Tenakth keep a tight border; the only way Aloy is allowed to travel their lands is by attending a summit between east and west. Her first real task, simply, is to ensure the summit goes off without a hitch.Throughout Forbidden West, characters comment on Aloy’s seemingly divine prowess. Little do they know, her “second sight” abilities are a result of how, as a child, she happened to find a wearable device from the old world called a Focus, which renders augmented reality overlays on the world, revealing a cascade of unseen information in neon light. In the early moments of Forbidden West, Aloy clues other characters into the verboten knowledge of the Focus, even providing versions of the device to her friends.Sequels to open-world games tend to lean on a trope: They typically kick off with some disaster or other narrative mishap stripping the main character of all the powers and gear you painstakingly earned in the first game. That’s not the case for Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy, who maintains much of her prowess, right down to certain skills—like the ability to slow down time while aiming her bow—being available from the start.This allows Horizon Forbidden West a unique opportunity. Instead of some trite sequence in which, for your benefit, she “learns” how to control a device she’s had years to master, Aloy walks her longtime friend Varl (John Macmillan)—and thus the player—through its quirks and functions. It’s a neat spin on the tired “you lost all your stuff” formula and forced tutorials that don’t make any narrative sense, for sure. But it’s nothing quite as groundbreaking as the highwater marks of its forebear.It is perhaps unfair to measure Horizon Forbidden West against the lofty expectations established by Zero Dawn. Let’s rewind for a second to the 2010s, a not-exactly-halcyon era that saw the big studios of the world caught up in a cycle of sequels and threequels and prequels. Here we had a brand-new series from a studio (Guerrilla Games) best known—and perhaps written off by some—for a quintessentially generic series of sci-fi shooters known as Killzone. But this new game…man, it wasn’t just good. With its distinct action and unforgettable enemies, it was phenomenal, setting a standard for what an ambitious big-budget video game could accomplish. How fun! How fresh! How pleasantly unexpected.From the jump, Horizon Forbidden West could never pull off the same hat trick. Its biggest gimmick—that it uses fossilized behemoths from the Mesozoic as blueprints for artificially intelligent war machines—isn’t a novelty that can be replicated. You know how it goes: You see one robot T. Rex, you’ve seen ‘em all.To compensate for a lack of what experts call “holy shit!”-ness, Horizon Forbidden West distracts by throwing more at you—more giant robot dinosaurs, more Hollywood A-listers, more lens flare, more skill trees and upgrade materials and weapon variations and categories of optional activities, more, more, more, more, more.Fundamental systems that worked, like Zero Dawn’s peerless bow-shooting and unique approach to clearing a massive map’s fog of war (you climb a robot brachiosaurus), have been expanded. A slew of imaginative new weapons—explosive javelins, rapid-fire bows—join reimagined versions of the classics. Where “ropecaster” bows were once strictly used to tie down finicky enemies, now you can also use them to attach explosive canisters to machines. Where “tripcaster” bows were once strictly used to place traps on the battlefield, now you can also use them to generate handy shield walls.The systems that didn’t work have been overhauled to the extent that they now do. Take, for instance, Zero Dawn’s climbing “puzzles,” which seemed like nothing more than a taped-on afterthought in 2017. Now, in part thanks to a nifty grappling hook and a straight-out-of-BotW hang glider, scaling cliffs and crumbled buildings is consistently engaging. (The obvious lesson: Put grappling hooks and hang gliders in every game.) Routes sprawl outward in branching, often head-scratching mazes. Whatever mechanical tweaks Guerrilla adjusted under the hood, you always feel in full control of where Aloy moves her limbs, too. The result is a recurrent mechanic akin to something out of Naughty Dog’s hit series of Uncharted adventure games—right down to that studio’s infamous “Hey this handhold seems like it’ll ho- ohhhh crap!” feature. What a welcome improvement.If this all sounds like I’m preoccupied with considering Forbidden West in the incandescent light of its predecessor, well, that’s because the game itself openly invites such comparison. It’s almost imperative that you play the first one (or at least read through a fan wiki from cover to cover). A “previously on” narration calls out key plot points yet doesn’t elucidate the emotional anchors that steady those points. Characters mention past events devoid of any contextual framing. And while this all contributes to a natural conversational cadence in cutscenes, to the sense that you’re stepping into a world as real as ours—one in which people talk like people rather than characters who have to awkwardly shoehorn exposition into their interactions—it can get confusing at times. Indeed, despite having played Zero Dawn twice, I had to refer to one of those fan wikis several times throughout my 50-odd hours with Forbidden West, just to understand WTF people were talking about.What’s more, Horizon Forbidden West doesn’t entirely wash itself of the sins of its past. In 2017, around the release of Zero Dawn, critic Dia Lacina pointed out how the game mishandled indigenous culture in a barnburner essay for Mic (originally published on Medium). Specifically, Lacina called out how Zero Dawn flagrantly tossed around phrases like “braves” and “savages” without including any deeper examination of said phrases, nor the historical weight behind them. The ensuing conversation spurred a response from Guerrilla; narrative director John Gonzalez told Vice the studio was “not intentionally being insensitive, or [meaning] to offend in any manner.”I don’t for a second profess to speak for people of indigenous descent, though I will note that I certainly ran into some eyebrow-raising moments over the course of Forbidden West. To be clear, I never heard the words “braves” or “savages,” which suggests Guerrilla is listening and has taken feedback from half a decade ago to heart. That said, unless an explanation totally passed me by, Forbidden West never addresses why many characters wear outfits reminiscent of traditional Native American clothing, a point of contention for some in the wake of Zero Dawn. All that “savior” stuff? Given that Aloy is white, and that so many characters in Horizon—in roles both crucial and secondary—are people of color, yeah, it’s weird! Due to those aforementioned embargo restrictions, which are so extensive as to bar me from mentioning a character who is literally in one of the trailers, I can’t get into detail here, but the entire final act—the denouement in particular—smacks of colonialist overtones, all in service of little more than sci-fi grandeur. In the coming days and weeks, as players approach and then complete the endgame, it’ll be a conversation to watch.It’s a shame, too, as Horizon Forbidden West’s first and second acts tee up intriguing mysteries that raise thematic issues such as the evils of colonization and the lengths to which obscenely wealthy people will go to shape the planet in their image. The game could have spent its conclusion confronting these topics head on, daring to use its post-apocalyptic world to say something meaningful about ours. But instead, it veers right into the potholes so many big-budget productions veer into, emphasizing twists for the sake of surprising the audience, expanding the fiction for the sake of beefing up the lore bibles, and, ultimately, raising the stakes to comical heights for no immediately apparent purpose beyond keeping the franchise engine roaring.Five years ago, Horizon Zero Dawn stood out among the crowd by openly challenging what we’d fairly come to expect from the insatiable serialization machine. Horizon Forbidden West has succumbed to the same machine.Where Horizon Forbidden West’s main quest falters, it’s propped up by a fount of truly excellent optional stuff. If you’re not stumbling upon a short story with surprising emotional heft, you’re battling a machine variant not seen in the main campaign, or uncovering some new way to play the game. One seemingly tedious early quest—in which you’re tasked with rescuing miners trapped in a waterlogged mine—contains the first tutorial for underwater swimming, an essential aspect of Forbidden West. (Worth it.) Scaling giant robodinos (called tallnecks) to defog the map isn’t just a matter of navigating hand- and footholds: each one also requires you to complete a bespoke and often entertaining side-quest. In one memorable sequence, I sat slack-jawed while battling my way through an abandoned treehouse city woven into a canopy of redwoods, just to get the necessary height to clamber aboard that region’s tallneck.After 50-odd hours, I’ve hit the credits with dozens of optional activities left unfinished, and I fully plan on checking out as many as I can in the coming weeks.These side-quests are enriched by Forbidden West’s stellar acting and frighteningly realistic facial capture tech. In a lovely touch, one I don’t think I’ve ever seen so aptly captured in a video game, characters don’t always maintain eye contact, often breaking it in the middle of conversation, looking off into the distance or down at their feet. Eye contact is hard! Real people don’t maintain it for every second of every conversation; we’re not BioWare dialogue trees.Horizon Forbidden West neatly organizes its library of secondary activities with a near foolproof set of submenus. Side-quests officially marked as side-quests are the meaty ones, the ones with fascinating narrative or mechanical twists. Errands, meanwhile, consist of the one-act stuff—standard fare like hunts and fetch quests. But even some errands offer up unique scenarios. (One notable errand had me quietly tail a robot triceratops and pluck flowers out of its, um, waste without getting noticed.) There are further categories for everything else, from combat challenges to platforming gauntlets to environmental puzzles tucked away in the world’s dustiest corners. By categorization alone, you can instantly tell the degree of depth you’ll find and commitment you’ll need for each activity, a design choice that more developers of open-world games should copy.But behind every small convenience hides a slightly less-small inconvenience, showing how the Horizon series—yeah, it’s a series now—has failed to keep pace with advancements made by open-world game design over the past half a decade.After you commandeer a dino-robot for use as a mount, you can call it to your side at any moment, but you can’t bring it into any settlements—a minor annoyance made particularly conspicuous when you visit a settlement arranged along a very narrow mountain pass. You leave your mount at one end, then call it to you again…a whole two seconds later. How’d you get here, buddy?When allies fall in battle, you can revive them, or they’ll automatically revive after about 30 seconds or so. Great! But when it comes time to follow those allies for a quest, you’ll have to slow down to match their speed. Less great…If you approach an environmental puzzle you can’t yet solve due to lacking a piece of gear, Aloy will openly remark how she doesn’t seem to have the necessary equipment, saving you from wasting time learning that yourself the hard way. Actually, hmm, no drawback to that one—it’s simply fantastic.There are dozens if not hundreds of fast-travel points, designated as campfires. The catch? You can only initiate travel when you’re at one of those campfires, unless you want to burn hard-earned shards (Horizon’s in-game currency).The autosave is forgiving, but if you want to manually save (c’mon, who here has full trust in the autosave?), you can only do it at one of these campfires.Then there’s the stash, one of Forbidden West’s most singularly accommodating features. When you loot a resource your pack is already full of, it’ll automatically go into your stash, which shows up at any of the game’s bazillion outposts and, in my experience, has limitless space. But while you’re exploring, you still have to stop in your tracks to pick stuff up; you can’t snag some flowers while sprinting through a field, à la Ghost of Tsushima.It’s a bummer that Horizon Forbidden West doesn’t make looting as seamless as possible, because the game is designed to have you loot everything. While exploring, you’ll nab ridgewood, fiberzest, vigorstem, bitter leaf, sourflame, medicinal berries, and crunchy spikestalks from a sea of vegetation. Off the metal skeletons of machines, you’ll get tusks, nerves, cores, coils, blaze, sparkers, circulators, stickpaste, blastpaste, glowblast, chillwater, purgewater, metalbite, crystal braiding, volatile sludge, machine hearts, machine muscle, machine minds. In chests and sunken caches, you’ll find relics from the old world, sellable trinkets like chimes (car keys) or jewelry (a smartwatch). All of those are real items from the game, by the way, save for one I totally made up. (See if you can’t guess.)These are essential not just for crafting various traps and tools but also for participating in Horizon Forbidden West’s economy. Want to buy a “pulverizing spike thrower”? Well, you’ll need 1,062 shards, a sunwing circulator, and a large machine core. Want to upgrade its efficacy? Okay, now you need 127 shards, four braided wires, four small machine cores, and one medium machine core. For the next level, and for the one after that, you’ll need a wholly different set of loot. These requirements are distinct for every piece of gear in the game.That’s not all. If you want to increase your carrying capacity, you’ll have to hunt non-machine creatures—actual animals—for hides, bones, feathers, and such, an act that gets real old, real fast. I’m not just saying this because the whimper a fox makes when it dies sounds a lot like the noise my cat makes when he’s hungry. (Okay, I’m kinda saying this because the whimper a fox makes when it dies sounds a lot like the noise my cat makes when he’s hungry.) It all feels like a tedious vestige from a prior era of gaming. Just let me spend my shards on a bigger quiver!All of your gear—whether it’s a long-range “sharpshot” bow or a snazzy armor set with perks that fit your playstyle—has a distinct array of stats, correlating positive or negative defense ratings for a litany of elemental damage types. You can tweak your equipment with “coils,” or augmentations, applying minor stat bonuses. Every enemy, too, is resistant to certain elements and weak to others, info you can pick up by highlighting them with Aloy’s Focus device.Zero Dawn set itself apart from its contemporaries by encouraging a thoughtful, tactical approach to combat, something that remains present in Forbidden West. You might be several levels over par, you might be playing on the standard difficulty tier, and you could still get stomped by a robot velociraptor if you’re not careful. Battles play out smoothest if you hammer out a plan of attack beforehand—marking enemy walking routes and laying traps and crafting the most effective ammo—so it behooves you to quietly assess combat scenarios from the sidelines and tailor your loadouts before jumping into the fray. But we all know how plans go, and sometimes you need to quickly break out the big bows. Whatever the case, your odds are best if you have a wide array of fully leveled-up equipment.I’m sure some people will salivate over all this potential fine-tuning; that sound you hear is the dulcet chorus of a thousand Google Sheets being opened and primed around the world. Me? I unlocked a skill that essentially turned one of Aloy’s bows into a rocket launcher and stopped obsessing about that stuff. If I had the loot necessary to complete an upgrade or buy a snazzy set of armor, cool! If not, well, so be it. I had rockets.Nothing in Horizon Forbidden West sunk its claws in me more than a mini-game. I’m not sure when exactly this trend truly took off—I blame The Witcher 3’s “Gwent”—but every expansive open-world RPG these days apparently has to feature an in-universe board game of some sort. Horizon Forbidden West’s take is a turn-based tactics game called “Machine Strike.”Matches of “Machine Strike” play out on a square grid-based board. You and an opponent each have a set number of pieces, all based on the machines you fight against in the “real” game. Your goal isn’t to wipe out all of your opponent’s pieces. See, every piece is allotted a number of points. Taking an opponent’s piece out will award you that many points; similarly, if you lose a piece, your opponent will earn however many points it was worth. Your goal is to hit seven points before your opponent does.You’re given 10 points to customize a set of pieces. Stronger pieces, which have higher attack and HP values, are typically worth more points. So it becomes a measure of risk-versus-reward. Do you stack your set with low-value, low-power pieces? Or do you choose just a couple of strong ones?The board itself is a strategic landmine. Tiles can appear as one of six terrain types, which alter a piece’s stats, sometimes providing bonus effects or debuffs. Plus, every piece—just like the machines they’re based on—has strengths and weaknesses. Attack one from the side and you may deal extra damage. Attack another from the same vantage, however, and you might hit armored sides, nullifying some of your damage.I cannot possibly emphasize this enough: “Machine Strike” on its lonesome might already be my favorite game of the year. (I’m a huge sucker for good tactics.) Were I not on a tight deadline to complete Horizon Forbidden West, I’d have sought out every single “Machine Strike” player.Oh, yes, “Machine Strike” isn’t just something you access via menus. Most towns, cities, and settlements are home to an NPC who plays the game. Defeat them on three boards and they’ll award you with a piece, which you can use to further customize your sets, helping you defeat tougher players in other towns. One afternoon, I found myself wholly ignoring my more pressing quest log and, instead, charted a course from Plainsong to Scalding Spear through Fall’s Edge and Thornmarsh—yes, the city names are amazing—just to seek out more “Machine Strike” players.It’s one small touch that makes Horizon Forbidden West’s settlements more than mere pit stops for resupplying. These cities aren’t real places, but sometimes feel like they are. Despite playing a major role in the game’s marketing, San Francisco plays a disappointingly minor role in Forbidden West’s overarching story, not even showing up (for me at least) until the 25-hour mark. Instead, you spend much of your time bouncing between truly visionary locales: a bustling post-apocalyptic metropolis built around a crashed cargo plane in the Nevada desert; a driftwood citadel on a whitesand beach near– according to my admittedly amateur geolocating–modern-day Alameda. It’s fantastical digital tourism at its finest.That’s what you want from an open-world game, right? Not necessarily an airtight main plot, as nice as such a thing is, but a believable, well-realized world you can lose yourself in. In that regard, Horizon Forbidden West hits it out of the park.A side-quest in Horizon Forbidden West’s opening area introduces you to an elderly man. He’s sitting on a ledge high in the mountains, staring at a giant robot pterodactyl embedded in a rocky spire, well and truly dead. He’s convinced that its death was an act of the gods, that observing it will grant him salvation, and so he plans on sitting and staring and waiting until he’s shown the heavenly lit way to a new home where everything is safe. Aloy points out how, actually, the bird-robot was gunned down by heavy artillery. He doesn’t listen. He’s convinced it’s a sign.Setting aside the high-minded sci-fi hijinks, Horizon Forbidden West is at its core about the extent to which characters will go to find faith and meaning. In her newfound “savior” status—again, still weird—Aloy finds herself fielding many of these evidence-free assertions. People go on and on about “land gods” and “diviners” and “legacies” and blah blah blah. At every turn, Aloy reacts to these whims with curled-lip bemusement. They claim to see god. Aloy knows the truth; she literally sees it.By the end of the game, I found myself reacting to Horizon Forbidden West itself with a similar curled-lip bemusement.""No BotW to distract you this time!"" - Kotaku.comSci-fi twist on the Museum of Natural History's dino hallFluid combat, sharp dialogue, a rewarding open world, constantly getting distracted by how damn pretty everything is.Instances of tone-deafness, minor inconveniences due to outdated design, a story that goes off the railsGuerrilla GamesPS4, PS5 (played)February 18, 2022Roughly 50 hours to hit the credits with roughly 50 percent completionHorizon Zero Dawn succeeded for many, many reasons, though perhaps its strongest feature was the way it expertly conveyed a dual-timeline narrative split between past (how the earth succumbed to robot apocalypse) and present (how the earth’s current inhabitants want to prevent another one). You made as much of the tale as you wanted to. Audio logs and text messages filled in the backstory of how exactly the world dovetailed into shit. You could opt into these as much or as little as you chose, but even if you availed yourself of every one, you’d still not know everything, not really. You filled in the gaps yourself.Audio logs and text messages are still present (by the hundreds) in the sequel, but Horizon Forbidden West goes out of its way to explicitly address questions—not just those posed in this game but those lingering from the first one too. Horizon is at its most intriguing when you’re slowly unspooling the thread. The magic trick doesn’t quite land when you’re having everything imparted to you via lecture and exposition. You and I will never know every little thing about the real world we live in—about its people, about its history. Why do we need to know so much about this fake one? Where’s the room for some imagination?It’s not solely a problem with Horizon Forbidden West, nor is it a problem limited to video games. You see it across popular genre fiction these days, as everything from Star Wars to the Marvel Cinematic Universe doubles down on plot over people, going so far as to fill in backstories for enigmatic characters who were killed off years ago. Everyone does it these days. It’s the safe play. Welcome to the Era of Fandom.I thoroughly enjoyed Horizon Forbidden West, and I suspect anyone who loves open-world RPGs will thoroughly enjoy it as well. But despite getting a kick out of fighting robot dinos, despite the enthralling time sink of “Machine Strike,” despite finding myself ravenous to return to this rich, inspired open world, I can’t shake how plainly Forbidden West misses the one philosophical throughline that helped its predecessor ascend to greatness: Sometimes, the question is more interesting than the answer. "
Destructoid,"darkIt’s been five years since Horizon Zero Dawn? It doesn’t feel like it! But within the context of the Horizon series as a whole, it does feel like Guerrilla Games has made a lot of strides in that time: and we all get to experience those efforts with Horizon Forbidden West.[This review contains broad spoilers for the first Horizon. No story spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West are present.]Horizon Forbidden West (PS4, PS5 [reviewed]) Developer: Guerrilla Games Publisher: Sony Released: February 18, 2022 MSRP: $69.99Let’s make this clear: if you liked Horizon Zero Dawn, you will in all likelihood dig Forbidden West. It’s a generally bigger, bolder sequel, without giving up what made the original game resonate with so many people.Since it’s been a while, it’s probably best if we recap the story just a bit. So Aloy is now aware of her role in the world, and how this Horizon universe came to be. We can dispense with the pageantry and most of the upfront mystery boxes. The sequel gets down to business, letting us know the stakes — the world is being corrupted unless Aloy can reenact preventative measures — and it kicks off immediately with that quest. The end of the first game presented a potential continuation of the narrative, with teases in tow, and Horizon Forbidden West delivers on that promise.I love that we’re presented with a clear sense of urgency immediately. “People are suffering” due to the terraforming, and Aloy has a plan to stop it (which is naturally going to have some twists and turns in there): easy hook! It also goes a little further with the technological angle now that the cat is out of the bag (especially when juxtaposed to less advanced societies), and we get to see more of her personal struggle with being a messiah figure now that she’s famous. How people react to that throws a wrench in the mix beyond the macro scope of the story.The technological/worldbuilding aspect of the narrative is not perfect, since it has to go bigger with what we already knew from the first game’s lighter touch and gradual reveal. It can get jargony and MacGuffin-ey — and there’s some cheesy dialogue choices — but it tethers all that with good character moments. It was very common for me to groan and light up in surprise in the same scene.This is fundamentally a different Aloy, and I prefer her journey in Horizon Forbidden West. We know her well at this point, and we get to see her fully unchained, on a practical and emotional level. While the dialogue is questionable at times (mostly from an expository standpoint), this world is still worth caring about. And for all of you continuity folks out there, we also get a reason for why she doesn’t have her upgraded gear (she “ran into trouble” before the events of the game).One thing that drew me in quickly beyond the renewed stakes was the world itself. It looks absolutely gorgeous on a PS5, and that’s due in part to the sequel’s brighter and more varied environments; the titular “west” of this universe. It all comes down to personal preference, but I found it really easy to get invested in this sequel’s aesthetic shift. It’s tough to talk about a few of the bigger areas without spoiling them, but suffice to say that a photo mode (which is included, to be clear) is a prerequisite. I’m also surprised at how well the team handled the underwater portions, which are usually a death knell in modern open-world games.I found it easier to get more invested in Horizon Forbidden West in general, actually, as there are more things to do as a whole. And I don’t mean “more pins in the map,” in a gamification/content dump sense. But tactically and mechanically, there are more options to approach how you play the game. More traps, extra weapons and items (and status effects), it all adds up. That sense of “setting the scene” for a big confrontation, then pulling the trigger and feeling satisfied in the ruin of your enemies, it’s all back.Gliding with the Shieldwing item (which makes open-world traversal so much better in tandem with the returning fast travel) and diving underwater with more expansive aquatic zones are huge parts of it. But there’s also more organic climbing opportunities thanks to a concerted effort to add more footholds, which make platforming that much more enjoyable from the smallest dungeon to the largest vista. Speaking of the former, underground areas tend to blend together less, as bunkers are more than just the same few types of layouts in Forbidden West.More enemies to fight is a huge plus, as the team generally goes bigger (literally), while putting a lot of love and care into the little guys, too. Machine and human-integrated fights add a wrinkle to a ton of marquee battles, and there are a few genuine “whoa” action game moments with story fights. All of this adds up to form a more dynamic, expansive game. Horizon Forbidden West is adopting some tried and true classic open-world design philosophies, too. Crafting and gathering are back, and it’s still just as serviceable as it was before. The crafting wheel keeps things efficient, and the detective vision (Focus) still justifies itself more than a lot of other projects.The visual feedback for the combat system makes fights a lot less frustrating, as you’ll be able to tell at a glance if something is plinking off armor, or digging into a soft spot with red and green arrows respectively; it’s not so busy that you lose track of everything. And when you get skill points like candy for trees with abilities that matter, you know you’re in for a good feedback loop. Cram in more accessibility options and you have a stew going.That expansiveness doesn’t come at a great cost, at least in my experience. I didn’t encounter very many bugs at all: just one instance where I had to refresh an area (leave and fast travel back) to talk to an NPC to trigger a quest. But given that Horizon Forbidden West — unlike another recent open-world game involving the undead — provides tons of auto-saves by default (and the option to manually save in whatever slots you want), it’s going to be hard to get into a truly game-breaking situation.I was worried about Horizon Forbidden West, but a few hours in a lot of my fears were eliminated. Guerrilla Games has a great handle on the open-world genre at this point, and knows how to cater to people who do like certain broader comfort-food elements without going overboard. It’s a shame that we have to wait so long between projects, but if it ensures this level of quality, I can deal.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Jason Faulkner 
The follow-up to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most eagerly anticipated titles of 2022, and for good reason. Its unique sci-fi take on humanity’s future set captivated players and made us want to see Aloy’s story through to the end. Horizon Forbidden West picks up right where the first game lets off and takes us into uncharted territory as Aloy tries to fulfill her destiny and complete the mission of Project Zero Dawn.Aloy defeated HADES at the conclusion of Horizon Zero Dawn, but it might have been for naught. Machines continue to run rampant and attack humans, crops are withering and dying, the Red Blight is spreading across the land, killing anything it touches, and massive storms blow savage winds and rain that threaten to drown out humanity’s last refuges. The terraforming system is collapsing, and it’s only a matter of time before the Earth becomes uninhabitable.So, Aloy is determined to find a backup of the terraforming AI GAIA. The original sacrificed herself to prevent HADES from using her power to destroy the ecosphere, but Aloy figures there must be at least one backup remaining. The data she has indicates that if she can reinitialize GAIA and reintegrate her subsystems, Zero Dawn can be saved, and the terraforming can be properly completed.The tale that ensues is one of the most engrossing we’ve seen on the PS5 yet and is an excellent swansong for the PS4. The Forbidden West introduces us to a ton of new characters, including the agrarian Utaru tribe and the warrior Tenkaths. We also get hints at what’s happening outside of the former United States with the introduction of the Quen.Attention to the lore really pays off in Forbidden West as a lot of questions that were posed by the first game are answered. Unlike Zero Dawn, which revealed the past in small snippets, the floodgates open up here, and the full picture of humanity’s downfall becomes clear.The gameplay in Horizon Forbidden West is much the same as in its predecessor. There are no significant changes to any of the systems. Instead, it builds on the exploration and combat and improves many of the issues players had with Zero Dawn.For the most part, you’re going to be doing a lot of exploration. The Forbidden West is covered in old ruins, tribal settlements, mountains, forests, and deserts. This time, there’s more verticality involved, and climbing has been revamped to be semi-freeform. It’s not quite like Breath of the Wild, where you could climb anywhere, but there are many more opportunities for scaling surfaces available.Aloy also gets some new tools to assist in navigation. These are introduced throughout the game and help you bypass obstacles that would otherwise block you from progressing. The Pullcaster serves as a grappling hook that lets you pull yourself up to anchors. Alternatively, you can use it to pull open vents, clear rubble, or pull crates. Aloy also gets a Shieldwing, which can be used to safely glide from heights, and a Diving Mask that allows her to breath underwater.Aloy’s new ability to travel underwater is one of the big highlights of the game and is used to significant effect. However, I don’t think the devs used it enough. One of the main missions takes place almost entirely underwater, but then the mechanic takes a backseat for the rest of the game. Since we have access to the coast of California, I would have liked to have seen some side quests diving in the ruins of San Fransisco and more opportunities for underwater exploration in general. As it is, you can dive underwater, but there’s not a ton of meaningful stuff to do there outside of picking up some aquatic plants and harvesting marine animals.Combat sees a bit of an upgrade in Forbidden West as well. The basics are still the same. Each enemy type has weakpoints and is strong and weak versus different elements. This time around, though, you can cause elemental overloads by hitting specific points with attacks of the right element. Hitting shock coils, for example, with a shock attack will cause it to overload after a short time and explode, which will immediately affect the machine with the stunned status effect. This allows for a quick follow-up with a critical melee attack which can do massive damage.Because of elemental overloads and weaknesses, it’s less imperative to remove armor this time around. Instead, you’ll want to use the improved scanner functionality to discover an enemy’s weaknesses and exploit them with the proper damage type. There are a few new elements this time around as well: Plasma, Acid, and Purgewater. However, one, Corruption, has been removed.Because of the added ability to hit enemies with status effects and their increased weaknesses, combat doesn’t feel as grueling this time around. You can also equip new Valor Surges, which give Aloy a timed buff. These correspond to the six skill trees (up from three in the last game) and can do things like increase ranged damage or stealth ability.Unfortunately, I found myself using machine overrides less and less. Many of the overrides now require you to both visit a cauldron and craft them using very rare machine parts, and the payoff just isn’t worth it. I get that the ability can be overpowered, but combat options have expanded enough to where just outright defeating machines is easy and fun enough that I didn’t want to go on a grand crusade to craft the overrides.Crafting is still a big part of gameplay and has been moderately improved. The inventory UI is better in general, and being able to refill Aloy’s materials from your stash easily makes crafting in the field much less irritating.However, one flaw does carry over from the first game, and it’s one we see in many open-world titles. There’s just too much crap to pick up. After every fight, you have to scour the area to make sure you grab every little doodad you’ve knocked off a machine. After the 35 hours or so it took to beat the main story (not to mention the additional 40-50 to knock out the rest of the content), I got tired of hoovering everything up.I wish Aloy could have crafted a little robot parrot to auto-loot the area, especially since getting some of the rarer machine materials requires you to knock off very specific parts that can be hard to find afterward. At the very least, some sort of auto collection for rare and higher-grade materials would have been appreciated.I would have also appreciated a cosmetic armor slot. Each armor has unique stats and buffs, so I often find myself wearing an outfit I didn’t like because it fit my playstyle. My Aloy shouldn’t have to look like a frump just because I need those concentration boosts.I played Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5 and regularly switched between performance and quality modes. You get a full 4K at 30fps and all the fancy lighting and particle effects in quality mode. However, I didn’t notice a massive difference in visuals between the two modes. Performance mode gets you 60fps with a variable resolution. Despite being lower fidelity, I suspect that most players will enjoy the latter mode more. The higher framerates really make the game come to life and highlight the great animations and combat.Unfortunately, there were some issues with the visuals, which were only somewhat alleviated by the day one patch. The game suffers from pop-in, which can be extremely noticeable in some areas. Sometimes it seemed like Level of Detail models weren’t loading in at all. I’d be heading toward an object, and parts of it would be hanging in the air until I was right on top of it, and then a building or tree would immediately appear out of thin air. This might be a bug instead of a limitation of the engine or console because it didn’t always happen.Horizon Forbidden West is a great sequel that’s full of twists and turns that ended in a satisfying conclusion. I won’t spoil anything, but it takes the series in a very interesting direction that I didn’t see coming when the game began. While not vastly different, the gameplay is a definite improvement over the original.Aside from some very minor bugs, Forbidden West was a treat to play and is an early contender for Game of the Year. Aloy’s journey across the West is a must-play for PlayStation owners and another reminder that Sony’s first-party studios are at the cutting edge of gaming.9Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowGuerrilla Games delivers a massive experience with Horizon Forbidden West that's sure to be a big hit among open world aficionados.Big open world games have a unique opportunity not afforded to titles that are smaller in scope. The number of moving parts allows developers to miss with one or two things and still provide an incredible experience. The key is to create mechanics fun and engaging enough to drown out the weaker ones. Horizon Forbidden West falls directly into this category, shining brightly in ways that make its few misses seem not so bad.Horizon Forbidden West is a post-apocalyptic open world game that continues Aloy’s journey. A huntress of the Nora tribe, Aloy earned the title of Brave by completing the Proving in Horizon Zero Dawn, a tournament held to test the skills of Nora adolescents. The events of the Proving became the catalyst for the story of Horizon Zero Dawn, with the High Matriarchs of the Nora tribe declaring Aloy a Seeker, someone who is allowed to explore beyond the borders of Nora land. That exploration and the events that unfolded made up the entirety of Horizon Zero Dawn, so we’ll stop there to avoid spoilers. Thankfully, Guerrilla Games has provided a handy recap tucked into the Extras menu before Horizon Forbidden West begins, so even those who didn’t partake in Aloy’s initial adventures can get caught up in short order.Horizon Forbidden West begins with Aloy searching for GAIA, a powerful AI that was responsible for the governance of the Zero Dawn Project that predates any events found in the games. This project was a terraforming system that was designed to restore life on Earth after rogue machines began eating biological matter. When things went sideways (massive understatement), GAIA sacrificed herself for humanity. Now, Aloy and her allies must search for GAIA to stop a blight that is threatening civilization. If that sounds like a lot for one person, it is, and Aloy’s personal journey running parallel to the overarching narrative includes grappling with that weight and the lofty expectations she puts on herself simultaneously.Once players set foot in the world, those that played Horizon Zero Dawn will feel a familiar gameplay loop in Horizon Forbidden West. This is not a reset of the systems, but rather an evolution. Aloy can still hide in tall grass to evade enemies or confront them head on with her spear, but both combat and exploration take steps forward thanks to gadgets like the Diving Mask or Gliderwing, and weapons like the Spike Thrower and Shredder Gauntlet. The Spike Thrower became a personal favorite because it's essentially a spear you throw that can do massive damage. It's a great way to get out to an early lead in a boss fight. These additions are all a success, delivering a fantastic experience that persists through the entirety of Horizon Forbidden West.From new gadgets that make exploration and combat more unique, to the skill tree expansion and introduction of Valor Surges, Horizon Forbidden West's gameplay is its greatest strength. I was heavily invested in hunting down machines for parts to upgrade my gear or skill points to unlock new abilities. The more I experimented, the more I realized that Horizon Forbidden West had considerable depth to its combat. At first, it feels like you’re just whacking machines with a stick until they topple, but soon you’re chaining attacks together and overwhelming your foes with speed and damage.It all starts with a skill tree that includes six branches: Warrior, Trapper, Hunter, Survivor, Infiltrator, and Machine Master. You can lean into one or two heavily or split your skill points by picking and choosing bits and pieces of each. If you invest in the right skills in a specific branch, you’ll unlock a Valor Surge that reflects that branch’s theme. Being a stealth player who enjoys the Hunter Bow and Spike Thrower, I dug into Hunter and Infiltrator. My go-to Valor Surge was called Stealth Stalker, allowing me to cloak and navigate tricky areas without being seen. These Valor Surges can be swapped in and out as required, so I’d swap the Stealth Stalker for Ranged Master to do massive damage with ranged weapons ahead of boss fights.This is how Horizon Forbidden West builds a satisfying gameplay loop. As you learn how different weapons and skills can be effective against various machines, you begin chasing those items. Any time I saw a vendor who sells weapons, I was dropping everything to browse their stock. When I found an item I wanted, I’d either buy it or create a Job (a self-created quest to locate needed resources to purchase or upgrade an item) to find the parts to buy it. This pushed me into the world to get those components, and along the path I’d inevitably discover a Cauldron to clear, Relic Ruin to explore, or Tallneck to climb. I’d run into new machines that pose different challenges, encouraging me to unlock new skills and buy more gear to deal with these new threats. It’s a rewarding cycle that never felt like a grind, but the one thing I wanted was a way to reset the skill tree. If it’s in the game, I haven’t found it, and there are certainly some skills I’d pass on in favor of others a second time around. Thankfully, you're swimming in skill points, so resetting the tree isn't crucial.This core gameplay loop is reinforced by some nifty additions, like Food Boosts obtained by purchasing meals from chefs found at various settlements throughout the world, or environmental traps capable of dealing big damage to big foes. Most of these can be ignored on lower difficulties if you just want to hit the big machine with the big stick, but the payoff is fantastic if you properly prepare for a fight and execute your strategy. I particularly enjoyed the moments before fighting a Cauldron boss, studying the machine and going through my inventory to find the right weapons and elements. Cauldron's are dungeon-like locations that Aloy can unseal. You'll typically work your way through a jumping puzzle of sorts, then fight a boss at the end. The reward is not only machine components, but also the ability to override a new machine and possibly mount it.Riding a machine makes traversal of the world much easier, and there is a lot of world to see and many things to do. You'll find yourself grabbing all sorts of collectibles, playing the new Strike mini game, and even partaking in races. There are activities around every corner, but none are forced on you. Feel free to dive into the things you enjoy and pass on the ones you don't. Horizon Forbidden West offers a plethora of content, but lets you pick and choose between it. If you are someone looking to see and do everything, expect to spend north of 70 hours in Horizon Forbidden West, and that's probably on the low end of estimates. Where I’m hot and cold with Horizon Forbidden West is its narrative. I was heavily invested in the main story and Aloy’s internal struggles. It was rewarding to watch her grow with the help of friends, though seeing Aloy struggle to live up to expectations she created for herself was at times difficult. Many will relate to the way she puts personal wellbeing and growth aside because there are more important matters at hand. Many of us ignore our own needs for what we perceive as the greater good, and in Aloy’s case the greater good is the survival of humanity. Point for Aloy.Where I fell off with my narrative interest was with random quest givers in the world. I thought Aloy’s immediate group of friends and allies all had interesting motives and asks, but once you get into the random population and tribes, the motive is mostly pure survival. Look, it’s as basic as it gets. It’s literally the core motive of every species that’s ever existed. It’s also not very interesting from one character to the next. In Horizon Forbidden West, I played main story missions because they were interesting, but I completed side quests for skill points and gear. The redeeming detail is that side quests include combat with machines comprised of components you want. They reward skill points that further your build and reward XP to level up. The tasks themselves are often interesting, I just didn’t really care about most of the characters asking for help.My hope is that everyone gets a chance to play Horizon Forbidden West on a PS5 with a 4K display. Guerrilla Games has created a breathtaking world. Whether it’s a quiet moment looking at the clear night sky, or a trek through snowy mountains, Horizon Forbidden West is a shining example of what the PS5 can accomplish with graphics, not unlike 2021's Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. My experience was smoother when set to Performance (high frame rate) instead of Resolution (consistent resolution), so take note in case that setting matters to you. I didn’t notice dips in resolution when I was set to Performance.The one visual downfall of Horizon Forbidden West is that it does not include color blind settings, which is a major oversight for a game that uses color to differentiate between components on machines that can be individually targeted. It’s perplexing given the effort put into accessibility, as Horizon Forbidden West includes custom difficulty options, co-pilot mode, button mapping, and settings to tweak the experience to very specific needs. I don’t know how many times I didn’t target a component vulnerable to chain reaction because I couldn’t tell which part it was. I would often opt for tear damage on larger components that I could see. Some of this was alleviated with combat experience, but color blind options are needed here.Being color blind meant that I often had to get very close to machines to differentiate their components, but there was a silver lining to this. The closer I was to machines, the more I found myself admiring the subtle beep and boop sounds they make as they go about their business. It almost gives a peaceful personality to machines that can turn violent in an instant. It’s also helpful to hear their telltale sounds over the crest of a hill, giving you the advantage over what lies ahead.Horizon Forbidden West does a masterful job with its sound across the board, including wonderful performances by its actors. Ashly Burch is fantastic, but so is a supporting cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lance Reddick, Carrie-Anne-Moss, Noshir Dalal, and more. Their performances are backed up by music that complements gameplay, building tension as you explore a Cauldron, only to fade after you defeat its boss. It’s not a new mechanic by any means, but I still love how tense music fades when the battle is over, letting you know that you can exhale.Horizon Forbidden West is an ambitious game that builds off the strengths of its predecessor in almost every way. The world is a more interesting place to spend time, the combat has evolved, and the visuals have taken leaps that exceeded my expectations even with the generation jump in hardware. It’s a shame that outside of the core cast there is a depth lacking for most of the characters, and leaving color blind options out of a game that uses color in its mechanics is a miss on otherwise great accessibility options. What I can’t let go of, though, is just how good Horizon Forbidden West is everywhere else. I need to find all the weapons. I must unlock all the skills. I’ve got to know what’s in those Relic Ruins or solve the puzzle and defeat the boss in the Cauldron. Horizon Forbidden West is absurdly good in so many ways that it borders on must-play for open world aficionados.This review is based on a PS5 digital download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

VG247,"Aloy is set to go west – where the skies are blue – but will life be peaceful there, or will mysterious threats ruin her freshly-minted hero status?You’ve just slid under a robotic elephant’s tusk as it tried to gore you with the entirety of its 10-tonne-plus weight. Some of your flowing red hair caught the tip of its kevlar tusk. But that hasn’t phased you; you look up, pull out an explosive spear and jam it under the beast’s jaw. A dodge roll to safety, a quick sprint behind a nearby knoll, and a look over your shoulder tells you it was a clean hit – the resulting explosion took the beast’s plated armour clean off. You notch an arrow to your bow, concentrate as you take aim, and fire. Bullseye! The tusk comes off, clean. Just what you needed for that weapon upgrade. 
Does this sound familiar? Because it is. Moment-to-moment, Horizon Forbidden West isn’t all that different from Zero Dawn. Sure, there are more bells and whistles, the world is bigger (and, somehow, also more dense), you’ve got some fancy new ways of getting about, and there are some new robotic animals to dispatch. But this is Zero Dawn, Mark II. For better and for worse. 
Guerrilla Games bolted out the gate with aplomb on its first venture into the reset future of the Horizon universe, kitbashing together some fluid My First Monster Hunter combat, a rich and tempting world full of collectible goodies, and a story that had the true identity of red-headed huntress Aloy nestled snugly at its center. Without that central conceit, though, Forbidden West seemed like a dubious proposition – could this 60-plus hour game keep me entertained, even when this main plot point has been removed?
Short answer; ""yes"" with an ""if."" Long answer, ""no"" with a ""but"". What Forbidden West lacks in narrative punch, it makes up for with its combat and some spectacularly-conceived set pieces. Just when you get bored with an errand making you go kill a Snapmaw again, or when you get frustrated with being sent back to an already-plundered location for a side quest when there’s a whole world to explore, the game always has another hook baited for you in a story mission to get you back onside.
But that’s not to say all the superfluous stuff is turgid; take the Tallnecks – those giraffe-cum-Brontasaurus machines from the first game that you need to climb to unveil local map markers. Forbidden West only wants you to do the standard find, climb, and scan stuff once. From then on, there’s always another way of tackling them – whether that’s using ballistas to bring them down in the midst of a Ravager siege, figuring out how to navigate a rudimentary Go Ape course to get high enough to override them, or whatever else, there’s typically a fresh take on the assumed task. A fair share of the map icons in Forbidden West map do this, too. Eat your heart out, Assassin’s Creed.
Open world fatigue is real, of course. A wealth of errands are drab, and the writing outside of the main quest (and main cast) is questionable at best, off-putting at worst. But that’s fine, because you’re only doing some of those missions to get more experience, right? The meat of this game is in working through the story, and wrapping up loose ends that fray off from the main narrative thread in the process. It’s just a shame about the go-here, do-this trudge that forms a large percent of the non-story experience.
About 10 hours in, you’ll unlock a sort-of hub – a home for Aloy where allies and friends gather. It reminds me of Mass Effect and the Normandy; you can grab what are effectively loyalty missions from the ragtag team that assembles over the course of the game. Here lies the game’s heart, really; the end of the world is fast approaching, but going off on one to find a replacement arm for your ex-warrior mate resounds a lot more than stopping some sort of synthetic plague. 
Guerrilla uses this base to really throw you out into the world, too, and highlight the bits it really wants you to see (and rightly so, because the map is bloody massive). ‘Remember that place you ran through in this story mission?’ the developer asks when you ask your newly-found friend why they’re so glum. ‘Go back there, and really get to know it. We think you’ll enjoy it.’ Suddenly, my quest to halt the terraforming threat that’s about to bring the world to its knees evaporates, and I’m in a village ogling the local flora and trying to find a way to make someone I’ve known for about 25 minutes a bit less sad. Credit to you, Guerrilla, you’ve side-tracked me again, and I’m enjoying it. This time.
It helps that this is one of the best-looking games I’ve ever played, too. Being tossed from the top of the map to its left-most extreme is bearable if I’m going from frozen mountains to lush, West Coast beaches. ‘Hey, maybe I’ll stop off at that jungle village en route to mop up that combat pit quest,’ I think as I set out on what will no doubt be a three-hour detour. An hour of that is in Photo Mode, as I try to capture Aloy’s face as she gets clotheslined off her mount into the snow, and some electric-fanged panther thing comes diving at her.
The combat itself is pumping. The new additions – Valor Surges you can deploy like special moves that give you stat buffs, new melee options that make hand-to-hand less of a drag, new weapons to break up the rhythm – are all OK, but they’re nothing worth writing home about. This series is always going to be about the rhythm of trapping, sneaking and shooting from range – every single encounter (except a few specific story battles) give you the option of starting from stealth. And rightly so, because that’s what this game is all about. 
The Decima Engine’s obsession with growing long grass everywhere gives you plenty of opportunity to get close to machines, target their weak parts, and go about dissembling them with precision bow shots, explosive javelins, boomerang discs, plasma-loaded crossbow bolts, acid bombs and whatever other deadly ephemera Aloy has managed to cram into her suspiciously concealed pouches. 
When the game is firing on all cylinders (you’ve set a trap to knock an avian machine out the air, you’ve peppered with arrows on the way down, and now you’re flinging glue bombs at it with impish glee), it’s hard not to love Forbidden West. It makes you feel like a superhero. After a fight with some behemoth bat-like thing in a late-game story mission, a companion remarks “I’ve never seen anyone fight machines like you Aloy!” Damn straight. I just took its ears off from about 100 meters away! Then I set it on fire! As I shredded its wings with razors! I’m a hunter god.
It’s a shame that the connective tissue between the set-pieces fails to burn as clean as the rest of the game. It’s thrilling to hit a new big narrative beat, see the wondrous zones that open up before you, and marvel at the technological feats Guerrilla has crammed into the game (the Las Vegas bit is going to be an all-timer, for example). But once you’ve saved the day for the locals and they start whining about a local machine that’s stolen their fuel supply, or want you to retrieve something from an outcrop in those hills, you start to roll your eyes. ‘I’m only doing this because I need the money,’ you mutter under your breath as you accept. You don’t do that in The Witcher, do you?
A novel mini-game helps plaster over some of the cracks in your downtime, and a breadth of collectibles litter the map, too, but there’s no hiding from the fact that – on the exhale – Forbidden West suffers from open world bloat. It’s satisfying to leap off a mountaintop, glide down into a new biome, absolutely obilterate some peacefully grazing machines and then grappling hook your way outta there, but rinse and repeat that across the whole map and it starts to get a bit monotonous. 
Perhaps I’m focusing a bit too much on the negatives here, but it’s what forms a lot of the process. I’ve put over 60 hours into Horizon: Forbidden West for this review, and the majority of that time has been spent in the world, helping my companions with their woes, and tending to the moronic NPCs that can’t do anything for themselves. It casts a shadow on the bombast and intrigue of the central plot – in a world where we’re seeing games weave these two elements together so satisfyingly, you can’t help but notice a title that doesn’t.
Horizon: Forbidden West does a great job of building on the foundation that Zero Dawn laid out; everything is more beautiful, the stakes are – somehow – higher, and the flirtations with BioWare-style story ideas shows just how much of a future this series has. The exploration and combat pillars of the game sing in harmony, too… it’s just a shame that there’s so much sludgy filler amongst all that well-oiled machine killer.

God is a Geek,"February 18, 2022Four whole years have passed since Aloy’s last adventure. Ever since, the red-haired warrior has been a part of the gaming zeitgeist. She became a PlayStation icon, much like Nathan Drake, Ratchet & Clank, and Sackboy. She was a woman who was physically and mentally strong, showed great courage in the face of adversity, and saved the world which Guerrilla created. Horizon Zero Dawn was a masterpiece. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Aloy was the stage, and the men and women around her were merely players. With such a force of nature, it was inevitable there would be a sequel. Not only that, but the huge cliffhanger at the end of Zero Dawn screamed out for more. Horizon Forbidden West is not just a worthy sequel, it’s another triumph, and quite possibly Guerrilla’s magnum opus.In every way, Horizon Forbidden West is superior to its predecessor. There’re new mechanics, tons of collectables and side quests, a dense and dynamic map, and more machines to fight and befriend. The story is also grander in every way, feeling much like The Empire Strikes Back did to A New Hope. Blight is ravaging the land, and a new threat is sending the world to the edge of extinction. Throughout the story, Aloy befriends new faces while working with old friends to stop the mysterious new enemy called the Zeniths. Sylens is back, and his mysterious post-credits scene from the prior game is explained. I thoroughly enjoyed Aloy’s journey in Forbidden West.The new land is dangerous, filled with fierce weather systems and machines ready to rip you from limb to limb. Not only that, but people can be just as deadly. Thankfully, Aloy is more than equipped to try and save humanity. There’re tons of weapons that can be used to take out various enemies, all with specific elemental ammo for those particularly vulnerable, whether it be fire, frost, or acid. There’re a range of bows that do damage at short and long range, with some best used to tear off machine parts. The Boltcaster is a powerful weapon that fires bursts of ammo in quick succession, and the BlastSling fires bombs to great effect. Aloy still has the Tripcaster shocking enemies and knocking them down, as well as Ropecaster for tying machines up to allow for flurries of damage.The spear is a masterful short range weapon for attacking enemies, and can deliver critical strikes and severe damage when used properly. New gadgets include the Shieldwing which is used for gliding from high places; the Diving Mask for swimming underwater without losing oxygen; the Igniter which destroys Firegleam and gets you into previously obstructed places; the Vinecutter that breaks down vines blocking entrances; and the Pullcaster allows you to grapple to higher points, pull machinery and platforms, and remove large amounts of rubble from blocked pathways. Horizon Forbidden West is filled with plenty of opportunities to make use of every piece of equipment.By defeating machines and killing other humans, the amount of craftable items can feel overwhelming. However, once you start to learn what parts are needed for what you want to buy or craft, there’s a satisfying flow to Horizon Forbidden West’s economy. By collecting machine parts, a visit to merchants across the map or workbenches let you craft new stuff, making your equipment better suited to deal with bigger threats. Metal Shards are the game’s currency, and can be used to spend how you wish, as well as repairing overridden machines. Coils and weaves can be equipped to weapons and outfits for added buffs to specific attacks or elemental specific gear. You can also use traps to great effect.Each machine will be weak or strong to particular elements. You can also focus on particular parts so that they lose particular opportunities to attack. Shoot an acid arrow at one of the cannisters on a Brickleback’s lower back and it’s game over. Shoot a Burrower in the eye and it’ll go down instantly. When it comes to larger machines like the Tideripper, Slaughterspine, Thunderjaw, or Tremortusk, there’re still plenty of ways to weaken its defences. You need to make sure you study them, whether in battle or from a far. This is part of why I adore the machines of Horizon Forbidden West. They are expertly designed, and each one is completely different from the next. Not only that, machines can be overridden. Find all the Cauldrons and its core to ride them in the wild.The map of Horizon Forbidden West is gigantic. Not only is it large, it is packed full of things to do. Relic Ruins hide orbs, and offer clever puzzles to solve. Rebel Camps and Outposts are filled with enemy clans to wipe out; Salvage Contracts let you find specific machine parts for a reward; Hunting Grounds and Melee Pits test your skills as a warrior; and finding all Tallnecks reveal more of the map’s secrets. There are Black Boxes and Vista Points to find that offer glimpses of the past; surveyor drones to take down; and so much more. Even the side quests are huge, with each one feeling more than just some generic fetch quest. Guerrilla has made sure everyone will have the option to spend hundreds of hours exploring the Forbidden West.On PS5, Horizon Forbidden West is stunning. The frozen and dangerous mountains; the sandstorms in the desert; the sunny coastline; the swamps and jungles. Everywhere you go, the landscapes are remarkable. Every inch of the map has been given plenty of attention. It feels like a living, breathing world. I was in awe of the fantastic job done in making the world so alive. The way the machines exist in their own habitat is incredible. It’s hard to use words to do justice to how spectacular the various environments are. Character animations are equally impressive. Combined with the impressive acting on display, the entire experience will be one not easily forgettable.Horizon Forbidden West is an enormous title that is filled to the brim with exciting missions and content. Combat consistently evolves, and the range of weapons and gear is staggering. The story is consistently engaging, and the characters are well-realised and thoroughly interesting. Aloy’s adventure is by far one of the most thrilling of this generation so far. She continues to be one of PlayStation’s most-beloved characters. Machines are perhaps the greatest part of the entire adventure. It’s fun to fight them, but also to watch them exist. They feel real. They feel alive. As much as I enjoyed taking them down, I found it highly satisfying to live among them.I’ve not seen a game look this spectacular before. From the various biomes and how their ecosystems work, to the vibrancy of the world and how NPCs all go about their daily lives, Horizon Forbidden West is another blockbuster. Bigger than the original in every way, I honestly can’t fault the stunning work Guerrilla Games has done in bringing the next chapter in Aloy’s story to the PlayStation 5. There isn’t a doubt in my mind it’ll be discussed in great detail come end of year discussions for GOTY. All that’s left for me to say is make sure you put time aside to play one of the greatest single player games of all time.An engaging story
