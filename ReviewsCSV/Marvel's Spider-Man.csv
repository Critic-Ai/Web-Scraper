Eurogamer,"Freedom of movement.Can you truly say you have lived until you have lamped someone with a manhole cover in Insomniac's new Spider-Man game? Sure, you may have known happiness to a certain degree. You may have known love, even. You may have rolled the dice, as the saying goes, and landed a few sevens. But lamping someone with a manhole cover? It's top-tier. Top of the shop, as an older generation might put it. Bam!
The tension of the thing! It is beautifully done. And it is a risk. To grab the manhole cover with your webs you must first find a highlightable manhole cover and then squeeze R1 and L1. Brilliantly, this takes a bit of time to pull off - you have to wait for a brisk little meter to fill up. While this is happening, whoever was already attacking you is presumably still attacking you. Your spidey-sense will be tingling and warning of an incoming punch or kick or burst of suit-shredding gunfire. But if you intend to lamp someone with a manhole cover, you cannot interrupt the flow of the meter to counter or dodge. You must be bold or reckless. You have to hope that you can get the manhole cover into the air before your enemies can pull a pre-emptive strike together.Yes, it must all take less than a second, but man, that less-than-a-second really counts. It plucks at you. And then you've been successful and the manhole cover is attached to springy, flexing webs. You fling it around in an arc to clear the immediate area, and then you launch it at someone. After hours of playing this game, I still don't know what black magic is involved in the selection here. I suspect the manhole cover receiver has to be somewhere near the middle of the screen, but really, it mostly feels like intuition. The game simply knows who you are aiming for. And then? Oof. A truly Platonic clobbering. Metal against flesh, and hopefully that deep hollow boom, lifted, along with the basics of combat, from the Arkham games, which tells you that this particular baddy is down for good. He will be headed to A&E. The manhole cover will probably be headed to A&E with him, in order to be surgically removed. Hopefully one of them has health insurance.As much of a highlight as this manhole cover business is, my favourite mission in the new Spider-Man game doesn't feature one. It doesn't feature civilians in peril or a big name villain on the rampage, although both these things are well taken care of elsewhere. Nobody is puckishly dangling a school bus off a bridge and no bombs need to be located to have their flickering red countdowns stopped by the cutting of wires. Instead, Peter Parker has been thrown out of his apartment due to late payment of his rent, and he must head off into the glittering, isolating lights of Manhattan to track down the garbage truck that contains his bin-bagged belongings.Listen: how would you even do that? Parker starts by calling the city sanitation department, and the gloriously weary dispatcher leads him to an area where the garbage men like to grab a pizza after work. You know the deal by now: it could be one of a handful of locations in Hell's Kitchen, and maybe - who knows? - there'll be a bit of very gentle fighting involved at some point. What matters, though, is that this task feels desperate and urgent but in an entirely domestic way. It feels daunting, but in the way that navigating traffic when you're late for a train feels daunting. It's more affecting than the big stuff, because it operates on a more human scale. Crucially, by the time I got Parker's trash back, I still felt like I had done something truly superheroic. The occasional oddball mission like this represents the Spider-Man difference, you could say. They take a game that is filled with borrowings and genre conventions and the usual suspect, and they give it a vital sense of real character. This open-world superhero game often feels different to all of the others, then. Not because of the things you do, because these are the things you always do, but because of the reasons you often have for doing them - for the life and character and charm that emerges from the context.The Spider-Man difference is glimpsed in everything. Combat, for example, still takes its lifeblood from the freeflow punch-ups of Arkham, but here it's coursing through the veins of a lither, less substantial hero who needs to dance in and out of confrontations taking as few blows as possible and darting up and away to safety when needed. Traversal, which, alongside fighting makes up the core of the game, is a hodgepodge of everything from the elasticated web-slinging of Spider-Man 2 to the up-the-side-of-a-building dash of Prototype, but it's enlivened with a youthful energy, a twist of the hips at the top of each arc, a distinctive and  adolescent jumble of shoulders and elbows and legs when perched on top of a finial, that way kids have of being naturally graceful and a complete disaster at the exact same time.  Elsewhere, towers unlock the map as in Far Cry, yet it's not a sprawling chunk of wilderness you're exploring but one of the most compact and characterful takes on Manhattan yet seen in a game. There are stealth sequences, QTEs, and boss fights that all take their cues from elsewhere, but the game retains its own personality throughout.Why might this be? Better to ask: just who's Spider-Man is this? The law firm of Maguire and Garfield is behind us and the new guy's not quite Tom Holland. This is an established Spider-Man we have here - living on his own, single, working an entry job in science in the city. Also, he's been Spider-Man long enough by now to chat to most of his super-villain enemies using their first names. The box and the start screen may say Marvel's Spider-Man, and there's all the fan-service you could ask for. But in truth it's Insomniac's Spider-Man. That's the key to this one, I think: it's a near-perfect marriage of developer and intellectual property (ugh). The people who do high-colour, cheery, knockabout fun have landed one of the few superheroes who seems to genuinely love the job - and they totally get that the reason he loves the job is because in his normal life, he's just like we've all been at some point: lonely, broke, awkwardly poised between childhood and the adult world. As a result, the traversal and the combat feel like more than just a bunch of nice systems delivered with lovely gamefeel or whatever you want to call it these days - they both have the genuine thrill of release to them.Both of them make the game's basic structure and challenges sing. The set-up here is pretty simple. In the opening sequence, Spider-Man puts a big New York villain away for a ten-stretch - actually, since this is comic books, it's probably a billion-stretch in a uranium cell that, magically, will still be busted out of in an issue or two - and then has to deal with the power vacuum left behind. The plot that emerges from this is an unusual beast, playing it straight and rather sedately for a while, before erupting into all-out chaos far later than seems feasible. I won't ruin it by revealing too much, but it's pleasantly riddled with cameos and team-ups, and, while the beats are rather heavily foreshadowed in places, there's a lovely sense of zip to the writing and performances. It's classy!In terms of the game itself, you pick through both story missions and side-business across a beautifully realised Manhattan. Head to the river on either side and you're politely turned around, but it hardly matters that you can't get to Brooklyn or New Jersey. The island itself is a compacted version of the real thing, but it has a great sense of character as you barrel down skyscraper canyons, dipping low over theatre-goers and tangles of yellow taxis or scurrying up brownstones in the village. The choices made are pretty interesting: midtown dominates this version of Manhattan, while Harlem and everything above the park is sadly a bit of an afterthought as is far too often the case, but money has been spent on paying for the rights to actual skyscrapers, by the looks of it, so you get to race up the side of the Flatiron and the Chrysler without finding a knock-off waiting for you. God it is energising to spring around a place like this. Spider-Man 2 has long been held up as the perfect game for nailing the web-slinging, but this might be the one that tops it. The core is very familiar - you swing through the streets by squeezing and releasing a trigger to fire webs, letting go at the top of each arc - but around that core a bunch of lovely additional ideas have been grafted on. There's an air-dash that sees you jetting forward without losing altitude - prodding around in the skill trees will allow you to combo this one - and you can wall-run or wall-crawl, and get a boost from springing off the upper edge of a tower. Insomniac's taken the webs themselves wonderfully seriously, by the bye. Each one you fire out could convincingly be attached to a nearby building, even though there's a lot of leeway involved in how you can move when you're hanging onto it. In practice, what this means is that the varying heights of different districts have their own styles of traversal. In midtown, you can get incredible air amongst the mega-structures. In the park, you are pretty much dragging your knees over the ground until you learn to properly leap each time you let go of a web. As with that magical manhole cover, the game seems to intuit what you want to do quite a lot of the time. Insomniac's found a wonderful sweetspot, I think: traversal is far from de-skilled, but it all feels so natural that when I handed over the controller briefly to someone else in the office who wanted to play, I found I couldn't really tell them what any of the buttons did. Only in my hands did the controller make sense.Traversal flows beautifully into combat, which is helpful since most missions, regardless of the story, involve going somewhere and then giving a bunch of people a shoeing. Spider-Man doesn't just take the basics of freeflow fighting from Arkham, it also borrows the way those games like to frame it. All-out punching is fine, but it's nice to start by stealthing around and picking people off with webs, moving from one highlighted zip-point to the next with a squeeze of both triggers, crawling across ceilings to get the perfect drop, and pondering target prioritisation - snipers first, right? Or the heavies?Once you're brawling, though, it doesn't feel as much like the Arkham games as you might expect. Partly this is because, by now, everything from Assassin's to Mordor and Mad Max has gotten into the act, but partly because Spider-Man moves around the environment more than those other heroes anyway. The surroundings play a much bigger part in the action, as you take damage and then swing your way out of trouble for a bit, dancing between grapple points and planning your next move.Fighting is wonderfully crunchy, and as the game progresses the options pile up. I love the web-zip that allows you to highlight a distant enemy and bolt right to them, following up with a launcher and a bit of air-pummelling perhaps. I love the gadgets that slowly unlock, starting with web shots that can bind up enemies (either immobilising them for a brisk kicking or actually sticking them to a wall and putting them out of action for good), before expanding to include a series of web bombs and trip-mines and electrical treats. There's a combo system and a focus meter that builds up over time allowing for instant takedowns. And, as the enemy types multiply, you'll start to explore the muddle of ancillary systems in the game's busy menus and discover different suits, many of which come with their own suit powers - one granting periods of bullet-proof skin, say, while another builds focus more quickly - along with suit mods that allow you to flare your character build in different directions: do you want to be able to take damage without resetting the combo meter, or do you want to snap out of an electrocuted state a bit quicker? Doesn't matter! You can equip both at once - or something else entirely. (In an act of pure kindness, you can wear the suit you want and also equip the suit power you want - you aren't locked into awful clothes with a killer gimmick.) All of this before you get to the skill trees, which are suitably busy with incremental abilities of their own.Moving between combat and traversal - and some other stealthy stuff that is best discovered yourself - allows Insomniac to keep the pleasantly soapy, heartfelt plot speeding along. A background in old school single-player campaigns means that the story missions feel a bit more polished than those in a lot of other open-world games, too. There are standouts, such as the garbage truck business and a wonderful dance up a skyscraper filled with groups of enemies and buzzed by a very twitchy helicopter, but even the most rote moments will be enlivened by a nice bit of dialogue or the sheer thrill of getting from A to B. Boss fights are a slight disappointment - the careful staging means they lack the energising rigour of the standard battles - but the game only starts to grate during a difficulty spike that erupts about three quarters of the way through when the whole thing suddenly gets a touch too hectic. Spider-Man's combat can be button-mashed, but it's actually at its best when there's a sense of fairness to it, and when it encourages precision. A precision manhole cover, say.Good as it is, it's away from the main campaign that I had some of my most memorable moments. The map's filled with distractions: various characters have chains of side-missions, then there are procedurally-generated crimes to tackle and bases to take back in a series of Horde-like gauntlets. But there are also monuments to photograph - surprisingly appealing, this, probably because it's New York - and other collectible delights. My very favourite thing in the game might be dashing around collecting the old bookbags that Parker's webbed up about the city at various stages in his career. Each contains a trinket from his past that Spider-Man fans will love - I loved them, and I'm not even remotely hardcore Marvel - and each glows with that special Crackdown Agility Orb green. Another inspired lift.Meanwhile, all of the side missions and collectables and photo-ops that litter the map give you a range of different tokens that feed into the economy, allowing you to buy new suits and mods. In truth, though, they're so beautifully done that I'd probably do them anyway. It was a real relief to finish the campaign here and discover I was only at 70 per cent completion. Again, this is Insomniac. The spirit of Sunset Overdrive in particular, I think: everything should feel fun to do and everything should be shot through with a distinctly life-in-your-early-twenties energy and sense of colour. What I love more than anything, is that behind the traversal and combat, Insomniac is a wonderfully controlling developer. For the entire length of the campaign they won't hand the city over to a day/night cycle or randomise the weather because they want total command of the atmosphere for the beats big and little to play out in. Just like they want those webs to attach to buildings in a convincing manner, they don't want to leave too many other details to be ground up in the cogs of an open-world. Somebody, in other words, is looking out for Spider-Man, a superhero whose pleasing vulnerability means that he needs looking after now and then - just as he could do with a little help getting his belongings out of the trash.And it's a reminder, then, that while it seems that games of a certain type - and a certain budget - are all converging these days, that all games are in a hurry to become the same game with the same tricks and the same hooks, there are still places, even within the most risk-averse of designs, for genuine character to bloom. Go get 'em, tiger.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.When Spider-Man hits its web-swinging peak it’s about as good as superhero gaming gets. Nailing a perfect, long arcing swoop between two buildings, or a hitting a split-second counter to one shot an enemy in slow-mo, constantly conjures up those ‘lost in the moment’ beats where you forget all about buttons and you just are what’s on screen. And the open-world New York this all takes place creates a perfect playground; a lively and beautiful looking backdrop to play out all those superhero fantasies against.It is a cookie cutter design - a well worn open-world template with a main story that crisscrosses districts full of challenges, side missions and collectibles - but when the core loop works so well, it’s easy to forgive. The systems are familiar, but the gameplay’s so smooth it’s impossible to resist. Combat is all about that hypnotically timed countering satisfaction, while its web swinging is always, always fun. Getting that building clearing arc just so, or skimming the tops of New York cabs never loses its thrill. Even now, some 35+ hours later (20-25 for completion, 10 odd for challenges, collectibles and the sheer hell of it) it’s not lost its shine. The word that kept coming out as I made notes during my review was ‘joy’. The fighting, the swinging, even the characters and story at certain points, is all just a joy to play. This take on Spider-Man is an older character, eight odd years into his web-swinging career. So no origin story and, thank God, no need to watch Uncle Ben die again (sorry Uncle Ben). It means you’re thrown straight in, with an opening set piece that plays almost like a climax, while threading in tutorial hints effortlessly through the action. Within seconds of starting you feel like you’ve always been Spidey, and it just builds from there. The core story - which I’ll stay away from in detail because it’s full of surprises and discoveries I don’t want to spoil - sees Peter Parker not just chasing bad guys but actually living up to that title of 'friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man'. Crimes pop up and things happen to keep you busy in a bustling, people-filled New York, with the city just as much a star here as any character. For all the villains, references and serious mission stuff, nothing more perfectly hits the spider-fantasy bullseye harder than jumping off a roof, diving to ground level and swinging at the last minute as surprised faces, car horns and street level bustle whooshes past in a blur. Those small random events like car crashes, assaults, store robberies and other ordinary crimes, only help to tie your efforts to the city and the people in it. It’s a lovely looking game too, especially on PS4 Pro. New York stretches off in impressively crisp detail as far as the eye can see (with the fat, orange afternoon sun shining off rain dappled streets particularly beautiful to swing through). It’s rare to see something this big and detailed consistently look so good, with the very final story moments in particular, some of the most spectacular looking stuff I’ve seen in awhile. Backing up the looks is a genuinely likeable set of characters across the whole game. Almost all the main parts are voiced and performed with a depth and charisma I wasn’t expecting. Yuri Lowenthal’s Peter Parker is instantly likeable and a worthy addition to the Spider-Man canon (which this game officially now is). He’s charming but human, and there are some actual laughs to be had at times when this really plays into the fact that, under the powers, he’s just a guy. It’s the same for the rest of the cast, from Aunt May to Norman Osborne (now Mayor of New York), all brought to life on screen in an impressively tangible way. The writing, performance and facial capture is all top notch stuff, to the point where a tightened jaw or a frown is just as effective as saying something out loud. There’s funny looks, genuinely touching moments, and a couple of bits where Osborne chews the scenery with simmering Mayoral indignation. Just watching people react is a treat.  That’s not to say it doesn’t have its dark moments. A few parts, and one section in particular, are potentially traumatic in a very real world way that might surprise those used to Spidey’s often lighter touch. I can’t decide whether it’s blunt shock tactics chasing a reaction, or an attempt to counter Spider-Man’s usually breezier adventures with a more grown-up feel, but it’ll likely split the audience. However, it says a lot that I cared in places I didn’t expect to. Like in the MCU’s Spider-Man Homecoming, when Tom Holland is trapped and crying under rubble, a sudden well placed reality check grounds things and stops it getting too cartoony. There are moments of carefully deployed gravitas here that elevate plot beats and story moments from video game cutscene to ‘forget where you put the controller down’ entertainment. As the story progresses, the game grows in scale but in a manageable way. The collectibles, challenges and side missions that appear, do so in their tens, not hundreds. They also earn you various currencies you can use to buy new gadgets, suits and abilities, giving them more of a practical application than just pure gameplay filler. Mastering the new gear and skills you unlock lets the game continue to grow - early basic punching gives way to carefully deployed web mines, perfect counters and wall leaping attacks. As you get further in, Parker’s grab bag of toys grows to produce endlessly, satisfying combinations of ways to take down entire gangs at a time. Plus your traversal skill grows in a very natural way. I had great fun at the start crudely  swinging, but my post-game fully kitted out Spidey is threading the needle under bridges at swinging speeds that would turn bones to dust if I missed.It's well balanced in terms of scale, growth and achievability, although there are some bits that may potentially tire you. Parker’s day job as a scientist is filled with electric circuit and spectrograph puzzles that, while enjoyable enough, smack of an attempt to give him some gameplay purpose beyond playable cutscenes. Mary Jane fairs a little better as a playable character, with stealth sections that expand the story as she investigates stuff as a reporter. They don’t overstay their welcome too much and generally have a payoff that make them worth the effort (plus one of her later sections is a real highlight). Spidey’s other non-plot activities do vary wildly. There are stealth, combat and drone chasing challenges lifted straight out of the Open World Side Mission Handbook and bases to take down, that are still fun all the same because of the well oiled mechanics behind them. While more narrative side missions and Research Stations (sciencey type things like collecting smog samples) are a mixed bag; some are enjoyable and interesting uses of mechanics, others are... okay. One thing that’s hard to overlook, however, is just how closely this follows the Batman Arkham playbook. It’s not just that mechanics like the twin stick hacking are lifted wholesale, but entire beats and concepts from the Arkham games as well. I can’t specifically say what without spoilers but there were moments I was astounded how closely this follows the Arkham template - to the point where I almost expected to see Rocksteady flash up in the credits. There were parts where a thing would happen and I’d just think, “really?! You’re doing that as well?” As far as games to crib from go, it's a good choice and this is up there with that series in quality, but it still feels a little odd. While we’re on negatives it’s worth noting that quick time events, when they appear, are oddly weighted. They’re so slow that it almost makes them harder; they lack the rhythmically obvious hit of something faster. XP is also handed out in such large amounts that character progress feels more story lead than by any effort on your part, with most main campaign missions guaranteeing a level increase. That abundant XP and glacial QTEs has a very casual games feel to it, somewhat at odds with the tougher challenges and fights you face later on. Nonetheless Spider-Man is still a hugely enjoyable adventure full of great characters and moments, and just about one of the best videogame realisations of superheroing to date. Insomniac are a studio with nearly 25 year's experience of producing slick, tactile action adventures that feel great to play, and seeing that expertise turned to a licensed game has created an impressively, polished and crafted experience. If you're looking for even more Spidey then check out all the Spider-Man PS4 Easter eggs we've found so far. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"Sony’s big budget superhero game is one of the most anticipated PlayStation 4 exclusives of the year but is it as amazing as it should be?An hour into Sony’s new Spider-Man game and the overriding thought is why don’t they do this sort of thing more often? ‘They’ being publishers in general and ‘this sort of thing’ being superhero games. Nowadays there’s much less pretence of any synergy between Hollywood and video games, not only because movie adaptations continue to flop but because gaming as a whole has managed to consistently ignore a trend that has dominated cinema for over 10 years now.Recently the only example of a good superhero action game (not counting fighters) has been the Batman: Arkham series, but you can now add Spider-Man to that list. Or rather re-add him, since he and the Caped Crusader are the only two superheroes that have anything like a consistent run of quality video games. In that sense it’s a shame that somebody else wasn’t given the spotlight, because there’s a lot in this Spider-Man game that will already be familiar to gamers whether they’re comic book fans or not. Although it’s rarely ever been done this well.Back when Activision had the licence there was a new Spider-Man game almost every year but it’s still 2004’s Spider-Man 2 movie adaptation that it is the benchmark for Spidey games and, until Batman: Arkham Asylum, superhero games in general. Sony’s Spider-Man is very similar to the old games, since it’s also an open world action adventure set in New York City, but half the time it seems as if Batman is the primary influence…Despite being referred to as Marvel’s Spider-Man this is not set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although there are small references to other Marvel characters it’s not, as far as we understand, set in any existing universe at all. It’s primarily based on the Ultimate comic book versions of characters though with some notable influences from the various movies, most obviously the Sam Raimi trilogy. That’s in terms of story beats and action sequences anyway, as the tone is decidedly more serious – despite Spidey’s non-stop quipping.There’s a clear attempt by developer Insomniac, makers of Ratchet & Clank, to create a more grounded story, with numerous sequences where you’re going about your relatively ordinary day as Peter Parker. It’s an understandable attempt to break up the action and create some moments of reflection but it doesn’t engage fully with the comic book melodrama and most of the cut scenes that result end up feeling rather ponderous and predictable.The story itself revolves around the arrest of the Kingpin, which starts a gang war led by newer character Mister Negative. For the first two-thirds of the game there’s actually very little in the way of supervillain action and you end up just beating up ordinary thugs and paramilitary types. It’s at this point you realise just how much the game is influenced by the Arkham titles, particularly when it comes to the combat.Spidey obviously has his web shooters, and is much more athletic than Batman, but the general style and rhythm of fighting is very similar, complete with semi-automatic dodges and a combo system that requires very little conscious thought to keep going. It’s enjoyable, but no matter how many extra moves and abilities you unlock it never gains any real depth. You also never feel Spider-Man is in much real danger, especially given how easy everything is on normal difficulty.The game borrows so often from Batman that you can recognise specific scenarios, puzzles, and elements of the plot. Spider-Man even has what is essentially detective vision, which comes in particularly useful in the occasional stealth sections which work almost exactly like the Predator sequences from the Arkham games. Spidey also has an Oracle stand-in chatting to him over the radio, although he doesn’t really need her given that the game highlights every single thing you need to do with a big obvious objective marker.When the game’s not riffing off of Batman it’s following the Ubisoft formula to the letter, complete with radio towers you need to activate in order to fill in your map, multiple sets of minor collectables, and mostly boring side missions. The collectables, which can also be obtained from stopping random crimes, then give you one of a range of resource tokens that are used to upgrade your suits and gadgets.(And if you’re worrying about having to wear that hideous white spider suit the whole game you can change it instantly with no penalty, as suit powers are all interchangeable.)This is all probably starting to sound quite negative but apart from a constant, mild sense of déjà vu the game is highly entertaining for the majority of its 20 hour story campaign. A lot of that is down to Spidey himself, who is an intrinsically fun character in terms of both his one-liners and his abilities. The all-important web-swinging works very similarly to Spider-Man 2 and rather than magically letting you move through the air it depends upon your webs being attached to a specific nearby building – so travelling around Central Park is a lot more difficult than downtown.The web-swinging perfectly captures the physicality of the character, as does the ability to parkour across rooftops and climb up and walls. But much like the combat it’s all rather easy and the learning curve is so short you’ll have perfectly mastered all the traversal mechanics within the first hour or so.Thankfully, just as you’re beginning to worry that the game isn’t going to justify its lengthy running time the third act twist kicks in and everything changes enough to keep you interested till the end (make sure not to miss the post-credit teasers). But overall the game has a surprisingly old-fashioned feel to it. Even to the point where there’s the occasional QTE sequence, although they’re much less distracting and numerous than you might have been fearing.But as entertaining as Spider-Man is there’s not a single element of gameplay with any real depth and the game is clearly terrified of its audience not knowing what to do for more than a few seconds. In other words, it’s just like most older tie-in games that on the surface use their licence well but purposefully constrain its potential in order not to put off a wider audience.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023We’re really not sure that approach is necessary though, not when something as relatively complex as Fortnite is the most popular video game in the world. But it’s typical publisher logic and unfortunately it stops Spider-Man from evolving into anything more notable than just a big budget crowd-pleaser.Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that and not only is this likely to be a huge hit for Sony but in large part it deserves to be. At the very least it will hopefully open the door for more superhero games in the future. Because even if you don’t know or care who any of the characters are modern gaming lacks heroic, selfless heroes like Spidey and it’s great to have the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man crawling back to consoles.In Short: The best Spider-Man game ever made… but only just, since it fails to move the superhero video game genre forward in any important way.Pros: Sky high production values and an impressive open world map. Web-swinging and combat are fun, if shallow, and there’s plenty of upgrades and side content.Cons: Almost every element has been seen before in previous Spider-Man or Batman games. Gameplay lacks depth and variety and the semi-grounded storytelling can be rather dull.Score: 7/10

Game Informer,"Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man is a triumph of superheroes and storytelling. Within a beautifully realized version of New York City, Spider-Man soars across the skyline with awe-inspiring grace, ducking into darkened alleys to pummel criminals in spectacular ways. The wall-crawler is front and center for most of this journey – spitting out quips and making a flashy show of heroism – but his mask frequently comes off to focus on Peter Parker’s struggles with relationships and the unpredictability of life.This complicated web is what separates this Spider-Man experience from the rest of the superhero games on the market. The story has a soul, and isn’t afraid to slow down after a hard-hitting fight to show players Peter is every bit as interesting as his alter ego. Almost every move Spider-Man makes is worthy of a highlight reel, but some of the most notable moments are seen through the eyes of Mary Jane Watson, Peter, and other characters. The story is filled with intrigue, and is legitimately funny and touching.Insomniac’s decision to forego an origin story pays off handsomely for both the narrative and gameplay. Spider-Man doesn’t freak out after punching someone for the first time; we see him in his prime as a force to be reckoned with. The second I gained control of him, I instantly felt like a hero who could handle any threat. He oozes power. His web swinging and acrobatic traversal are the most impressive elements, allowing players to rocket across the city by chaining together high-flying maneuvers. Running along walls, bouncing off of poles, and twirling through tight gaps are easily handled.The web swinging is so much fun that I never once used the subway to fast travel. The city is another reason to use the long route to destinations, as it's a work of art that I continually marveled at for its architectural design and people-watching potential. I also didn't want to miss a second of J. Johan Jameson's hilarious alarmist superhero podcast.Most of the city exploration leads to discoveries and Spider-Man becoming more powerful. Yes, he’s a seasoned veteran, but he’s also a skilled inventor who is continually making technological breakthroughs. By the time the credits roll, his power grows exponentially through his gadgets. With one press of the button, a group of enemies can be electrified or launched into the air (where they hovered in a stasis field). Gaining new toys is an incredibly satisfying element of this experience that Insomniac masterfully dangles like a carrot in front of the player.Meaningful enhancements are also incorporated into the dozens of suits Peter assembles. From the Iron Spider Suit’s awesome multi-legged attacks to the handy “Spider-Bro” companion equipped in the Stark Suit, there’s no shortage of ways to mess with your adversaries.Most of the story-based missions feature excellently designed combat sequences that use the environment well, both for enemy placement and stretching out Spidey’s powers. The missions almost always offer an unpredictable element. One may feature environmental chaos, another could dive into Peter’s mind for a dream-like moment.You also can’t rule out Mary Jane or another character getting involved. Control switches to these characters frequently, and at the right times. M.J.’s gameplay shows us why she’s a great investigative reporter. The other character’s sequences are some of the most shocking in the game. I enjoyed playing as both of these heroes (though not as much as Spidey). They bring variety in fun ways, including solid stealth mechanics and clever puzzles.The open world is filled with activities, though some fall victim to extensive repetition. Performing the same button taps to stop a speeding car grows old quickly, as does catching pigeons. The Taskmaster challenges are a good test of skill, and I love the breeziness of Black Cat’s Where’s Waldo-style photo missions. The city activities and Osborn missions are the weakest of the lot. Combat arenas, of which there are many types, are leaned on too much, especially in the final act.Given how personal this story is for Peter, many of the villains are bred from his relationships. In a way, the game is an origin story for them. They receive plenty of screen time, and are brilliantly tied to Peter’s life. Mr. Negative wasn’t a household name before the release of this game, but he will be now. He exudes a different type of evil than we usually see. His defining moment occurs in a surprisingly disturbing sequence.Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes. You feel like you’re doing everything he’s capable of. Insomniac succeeds in making Peter and the supporting cast just as memorable and engaging as the wall crawler. Excitement is delivered consistently from the outside of play right up to the last story frame, which is a real shocker that contains a reveal that will make the wait for the sequel almost unbearable.

Polygon,"Filed under:Filled with heart-pounding, high-flying action, Spider-Man is a polished, fun and sometimes frustrating PS4 exclusiveMarvel’s Spider-Man is the most polished entry to date in a dense catalog of games starring the web-slinger, and the first to be propped up as a first-party console exclusive since the Sega Genesis. The benefits of Sony’s publishing division and developer Insomniac Games decades of talent juicing PlayStation hardware have produced a game that truly looks like a superhero movie that would be released in 2018. But Spider-Man doesn’t feel like a superhero movie in 2018. This Spider-Man is a throwback to a simpler time, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe expected fans to follow a dozen storylines through a decadelong multi-film gauntlet. There was a time when superhero movies were light and exhilarating, targeting the broadest possible audience with blunt but energetic romps in which good triumphs over evil and heroes defeat harrowing odds.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

It offers the thrill of swinging between astonishingly realistic skyscrapers across an uninterrupted Manhattan skyline, but also relies on relics of open-world gameplay that feel jarring and dated. Its world brims with elaborate set-pieces, and yet, like so many flashy blockbusters, it never quite finds the beat in its heart-pounding action.For better and worse, Spider-Man is a meticulously rendered throwback to old Spidey films and games, to the last decade of open-world game design and to an easy style of superhero storytelling we rarely get to see anymore.This version of Spider-Man is set in a present-day New York City, which is run by Mayor Norman Osborn. Peter Parker is 23, working as a research assistant, on the outs with Mary Jane, and in a slump in life. But as Spidey, he’s already put away villains like Rhino, Electro and Vulture, and has established a friendly partnership with the police. After taking down one crime lord at the game’s start, Peter is let loose on the entirety of the city to stop crime as only a Spider-Man can.Spider-Man’s Manhattan captures the paradoxical architectural vastness and relative geographical smallness of the actual island. You’re immediately able to swing freely from building to building, making great arcs in the air up the city’s wide avenues. There’s very little learning curve to perfecting your traversal, and the breezy movement — particularly when you fling yourself through the sky at the zenith of a web-swing — never gets old. Even when the game’s fast travel finally unlocked, I felt like I would much rather get to my destination the old-fashioned way: swinging down Fifth Avenue, barely missing cabs and pedestrians. You aren’t gated off from any part of Manhattan (sorry, other boroughs!), though you’re unable to see the full map of the city until you unscramble some conveniently broken radio towers in each section of town. This feels like a dated impediment to your progress; traveling to those zones isn’t more hazardous, and nearby objectives and crimes are still visible with a quick scan by pressing in the right stick. It makes the task feel less like an achievement and more like in-game busy work. These hurdles contrast with a vigorously paced throughline. Spider-Man is excellent at maintaining an urgent tone, and you’re never lacking for anything to do. Spidey’s cellphone is always ringing with a mix of crimes in progress and Peter’s real-life obligations. You’re patched into scanner traffic with random crimes that happen around town, and J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with a penchant for screaming fits, has moved to the airwaves. His anti-Spider-Man tirades will often fill your ears as you move to your next goal.Spider-Man’s main objectives strike the balance between Peter’s life (Aunt May needs help at the shelter, you’re needed back at work) and Spidey’s crime-fighting, and the game succeeds in highlighting the struggle of that dual identity, especially in its early acts. Of course, as the game’s plot starts to take shape and rising villain Mister Negative gains power, the line blurs. Each main game encounter feels cinematic, to the point that they could almost be stitched together and feel like another entry in the MCU. (And just like in the MCU, you’re rewarded if you know Spider-Man lore, as the game is packed with series favorites that casual fans will know, along with villains who have yet to receive the big-screen treatment.)The biggest moments in Spider-Man are as varied as they are dramatic. You scale a building through its elevator shafts, covertly webbing snipers that appear through sliding elevator doors while dodging flaming bombs hurled from above. You chase a helicopter dragging a crane through NYC’s skyscrapers, dodging missiles as it smashes into — and sometimes through! — buildings. In some of the most entertaining sequences, Peter shares the spotlight, allowing the action to take a break from the impressively animated but largely familiar combat.However, the game’s cinematic leanings can cut in the wrong direction. Often I felt like I had very little agency in the most breathtaking sequences, having to only conquer a few lenient quick-time events to achieve the most dramatic feats. While I can appreciate the spectacle, it’s hard to feel like you’ve actually stopped that helicopter from crashing into the ground. You become a witness to the heroics, rather than the one who carried them out, which is the exact opposite of the power fantasy.This feels especially true when you take on any of Spider-Man’s main villains. The boss fights for core bad guys, like Scorpion or Kingpin, often rely on one sequence of moves: Web up your enemy, zip in close by pressing triangle and repeatedly pummel them by hammering square, then back away, dodge attacks and repeat until they’re captured. I didn’t feel any of the challenge that fighting someone so legendary should entail. Combat in other sections of the game can be rewarding, though, particularly when Spider-Man is allowed to vary up techniques with a collection of moves and gadgets. While there are a couple of simple ways to play — and look cool doing it — Spider-Man rewards mastering new moves as you unlock them. Swing-kicking into a group of enemies, disarming one carrying a machine gun or stun baton, throwing him up into the air and finishing him with an air combo feels fantastic. There are a lot of extra gadgets and suit powers, too, and while none of them are required to win fights, finding your favorite arsenal and implementing it is where the game’s real challenge lies. Most of these longer fights are found in Spider-Man’s side missions, which are scattered around Manhattan but always easily located on your map. The base missions, which contain waves of enemies rushing Spidey, are critical if you want to unlock the game’s multitude of extra costumes, almost all of which contain a unique power that can be mixed and matched into your play style. Every side objective — stopping random crimes, collecting backpacks full of Spidey mementos stashed around town, snapping pictures of famous NYC landmarks (real and fictional), or completing timed objectives like disarming bombs — converts to tokens that can be cashed in for suit and gadget upgrades. None of these are required to progress your main story, though many contain interesting flavors that will satiate folks more aware of Spider-Man’s long history and rogues’ gallery.Insomniac has put time and care into making Spider-Man the quippy hero we’ve come to expect, and the world-building in the game’s writing paints a clear picture of Peter Parker. (The social media feed, found on the map screen, has some particularly relevant gems that capture what Spidey’s life would be like if he lived in 2018.) But unfortunately, that personality and charm doesn’t always extend to New York City itself. I’d often run into the same few character models over and over, and the city lacks the diversity and ambiance I’d expect from New York. That small example may highlight my biggest criticism of Marvel’s Spider-Man. There aren’t many surprises to the game; despite being an open-world experience, it plays upon a linear story, and the twists that happen feel familiar. The action sequences are breathless and memorable, but after the game’s final act I was left wanting more. Just like a summer blockbuster, Spider-Man leaves too much waiting in the wings for its obviously upcoming sequel.

   on August 10, 2022 at 5:22PM PDTThis review has been updated to include impressions of Spider-Man Remastered's PC version, released in 2022. The initial review, written by Edmond Tran in 2018, follows. The new text, written by Alessandro Barbosa in 2022, has been added at the bottom of the original review.You can't go past Spider-Man's best stories without a good duality--the awkwardness of Peter Parker versus the confidence of his alter ego, the relatable humanity of his adversaries versus their heinous deeds, and the age-old ditty about juggling power and responsibility. Insomniac's take on Spider-Man juggles dualism too, not just in its narrative themes but its mechanical execution. Intense boss fights are balanced with leisurely exploration. You'll make the most of Spidey's acrobatic abilities in the open world, but also the mundane abilities of his less super-powered allies in linear stages. Dualities usually suggest there's a poorer trait, but they're often integral in characterizing the whole. That's Insomniac's Spider-Man--it's a fantastic experience that completely absorbs you into its unique slice of the Marvel universe, and while that's partly defined by a slew of menial tasks, it becomes easy to forgive, because they're part of what helps complete the fantasy of becoming a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Marvel's Spider-Man ReviewIt's obvious to point out that a lot of the ideas in Marvel's Spider-Man have already appeared in a number of existing video game interpretations of the character--surely one of the pitfalls of revisiting something so perennially popular. But where Insomniac's version elevates itself, and where it makes an immediate impact, is in the slick presentation that neatly wraps major parts of the experience. It's obvious that the last decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe releases has had an effect here--its photorealistic slant shies away from any overt association to comic books. Bright, saturated colors and stirring orchestral hooks are ever-present, and sweeping angles with camera effects majestically frame Spidey's signature combat style and acrobatics around the city, emphasizing them as the hyperreal feats they are.But it's the story that has benefited from Marvel's popular cinematic formula the most. Insomniac's interpretation spends a lot of time focusing on the human side of the tale, and Marvel's Spider-Man features some solid understated performances. Peter Parker is an experienced Spidey, but still suitably dorky, and his relationships with the important people in his life have a major role to play. The game spends ample time dwelling on supporting characters, a move which aids later narrative developments in producing more effective impacts.There's always an interesting dynamic with superhero stories--you'll likely be able to accurately predict the fates of characters you're familiar with, but going along for that ride regardless and watching with bated interest to see how things unfold this time around is where the value lies. Marvel's Spider-Man takes inspiration from an Amazing Spider-Man storyline penned by Dan Slott, who is credited as a writer here. Peter's elderly Aunt May works at a homeless shelter run by Martin Li, an entrepreneur with a selfless heart of gold, but also a more negative side. Needless to say, things get complicated and worlds collide, but Insomniac takes multiple hard detours from the source material.Li and other antagonists also benefit from a generous amount of time devoted to exploring their humanity, through both cutscenes as well as environmental storytelling. Marvel's Spider-Man features segments where you explore key locations as Peter Parker, observing spaces, finding audio logs, listening to Pete's self-narration, chatting with characters, and playing minigames passed off as ""scientific research."" You'll also occasionally step into the shoes of other characters like Mary Jane, a Daily Bugle journalist in this timeline, as she dives into a more involved investigation using her own unique sets of skills.Mary Jane's stages feature rudimentary stealth mechanics on top of regular exploration, and her clandestine skillset becomes more diverse as you continue to revisit her side of the story. These mechanics aren't particularly demanding and you don't use them enough to wear out their welcome, but these supporting segments do feature some memorably tense scenarios and as a whole do help create a stronger attachment to the characters. It's easy to find yourself feeling more involved.All this narrative build-up pays off in a big way, too, and when the game does reach its tipping point, it's shocking how devastating the events can feel--even if you can predict what's coming. Marvel's Spider-Man is very good at making its stakes feel sky-high, evil actions genuinely villainous, consequences actually upsetting. The story is emotionally charged and effective at spurring you into action--late in the game, there's an urgency that builds up and succeeds in creating the superhero's dilemma of being pulled in multiple places at once, each option a dire situation, and the circumstances make you feel helpless despite your supernatural abilities. It's an incredible feeling, and the major beats of Spider-Man's story missions are certainly one of the game's highlights.The high bar set in the main plot shines a harsher light on the rest of the game's activities, though. The game features a number of side quests, most of which branch off the main story, but these don't have the same narrative energy as the main throughline, which makes them much less compelling. There are also a number of other optional activities, all ostensibly moderate tests of skill asking you to exercise your abilities in combat, traversal, or stealth. These challenges can be unique, but the dressing on them can also be uninspired, making them strange at best (curing avian flu in pigeons) and menial at worst (three different kinds of horde mode-style challenges).Dealing with trivial matters are all part of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, of course. Randomly occurring crimes, as well as two different collectible-hunting activities that encourage you to explore the city, are the activities that best embody this idea, despite becoming repetitive. But when tasks like backing up computer data, relieving the city's steam pipe pressure, or catching pigeons suddenly become Spidey's number one, life-or-death priority when there's some pretty serious stuff going on in the main story, it's hard not to be a little bewildered.The best incentive to complete activities is tied to progression--each type offers its own unique tokens as the reward, used to purchase new suits, gadgets, and upgrades. Oddly, the most exciting activities are the ones plainly labeled as ""Challenge Missions."" These ask you to push yourself in time trials to break a series of benchmarks records for bonus tokens. Completing challenge missions are surprisingly the most motivating and rewarding of all the activities, even containing some special surprises.The strangest part about the game's activities lies in the use of a trite open-world mechanic: tower reveals. You begin the game with a blank world map, and it's necessary to make time to traverse through each of Manhattan's neighborhoods to find and reactivate a number of towers in order to uncover the map and pinpoint optional activities. There is some light narrative justification for this (Spidey needs to get access to local police radio for info on crimes) but it doesn't address the puzzling nature of a veteran Spider-Man not innately knowing how to get around New York City.However, for all the bewildering mundanity, the optional activities do provide some welcome relief in pacing from the more intense episodes of the main story. In fact, the game at times will give Spidey (and by extension, you) dedicated time for breaks in between missions to clear your head with some silly, low-stakes activities. And in the end, despite their obvious flaws, they are undeniably irresistible to seek out and complete, purely because they act as a satisfactory enough reason to get out there and play with Spider-Man's sensational web-slinging mechanics.Swinging around New York as Spider-Man is endlessly fulfilling. It's a relatively straightforward system that isn't overly demanding on inputs, but the minor adjustments and variables in terrain you need to consider while in motion (webs require tangible attach points), as well as the weighty feeling of Spidey makes the process feel satisfyingly manual--there's just enough effort required to make you feel as if it's all on you. During a big swing, you may decide to hold on for just a little longer so you can leap higher and gain elevation. Then, while mid-somersault, you scan the environment and assess that a water tower atop a building you cleared is the best next option, so you accurately shoot a web to zip to its vertex, but when Spidey makes contact, you perfectly time a jump and push off with a bonus burst of forward momentum.The fluid animations, visual effects, and controller rumble play a big part in selling the intensity, the speed and the giddiness of flinging yourself through the air. Spidey transitions between different movement techniques seamlessly in most cases, and there's also a slowdown mechanic that assists in helping you make more accurate and graceful traversal decisions. Holding L2 will slow down time to a crawl and let you manually aim a zip-to-point maneuver, but also let you initiate surprise attacks on enemies or perform other tasks--taking a photo of an iconic NYC monument to complete a challenge mid-swing, for example, can give you a wonderful feeling of competency. Because it's such an involved task, swinging around is Spider-Man's greatest joy. Despite its simplicity, every move you connect feels like a small victory, and the pace is rhythmic enough that putting in the effort to move elegantly becomes an absorbing experience.There's a similar gratification to be had from Spider-Man's combat. The Arkham Asylum-inspired crowd fighting system suitably characterizes Spidey's acrobatic nature, and like web-slinging, observing the enemies and environment to find your next best move makes it a satisfying puzzle. It only takes a few hits for Spidey to go down, so picking the right gadgets and powers for the job, using the right techniques for different kinds of enemies, being proactive in using your skills to manage overwhelming groups, and working to earn buffs and long combos by focusing on hitting your attacks and dodges with perfect timing keeps even relatively unchallenging encounters interesting.Combat-specific challenges also encourage you to mix up your technique, but it's the fluid transitions between attacks and the appearance of a natural flow that again sell the excitement. Spidey's flashy finishers and their over-the-top camera movements work to add some pizazz in addition to being an excellent tool in their own right, though you'll see these animations countless time throughout the course of the game, and they do start to lose their impact. This also true of the optional stealth mechanics which, while effective, will often see you watching the same stealth takedown animations again and again if you choose to go down that path.What helps curb the monotony of combat later in the game are the story's boss battles. These fights are intensely chaotic affairs, featuring unique takedowns and bombastic set pieces. Though the solution to beating them doesn't take much to figure out, your opponents attack relentlessly, meaning you'll have to constantly stay on your toes, moving and dodging around while waiting for an opening--a dynamic that feels very true to the character, which goes a long way in making these moments memorable.Minor shortcomings don't detract from Insomniac's achievement in creating a game that feels like an authentic interpretation of a beloved creation. The feeling of embodying Spidey and using his abilities is astonishing, and the time spent on exploring its major characters help make its story feel heartfelt, despite superhero bombast. There have been open-world Spider-Man games before, but none so riveting and full of personality, none that explore and do justice to this many facets of the universe. Insomniac has created a superior Spider-Man experience that leaves a lasting impression, one that has you longing for just one more swing around New York City, even after the credits roll.In its transition to PC, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered retains the visual splendor it featured on PS5. The PC version is co-developed by Nixxes and hosts a suite of options for you to tinker with in order to tune performance and fidelity according to your system, with modern features sets such as ray tracing, Nvidia's DLSS, ultrawide monitor support, and more included. This remastered version also includes all three additional story DLC chapters which can be accessed from the start of the game (though this is ill-advised, given these post-game scenarios don't gracefully scale for an entry-level Spider-Man). Whether swinging through the streets of New York or admiring the details in Central Park, Spider-Man Remastered can look noticeably better on a powerful PC than on console. In our testing (using an RTX 3080 Ti, AMD Ryzen 5600X, and 32GB of DDR4-3200 RAM), running the game at its highest preset (with ray-traced reflections at High) at 1440p was a relative breeze without the need to depend on dynamic resolution settings or AI-based upscaling such as DLSS. The most taxing scenarios were those out in the open world, where your ability to zip through the city at speed puts strain on your hardware's ability to load everything quickly and at the desired detail levels you've chosen. It was here where the game usually hovered around the 60-80fps mark, with less-intense indoor scenes seeing double that on most occasions. Curiously, with this settings configuration, both GPU and CPU usage rarely went over 75%, despite the game having lots of room to push higher on a 165Hz display.Increasing the resolution to 4K did push up GPU utilization significantly, as expected, with the overall average now around 95%. With the game more bound by GPU horsepower, it's clearer now that at lower resolutions the CPU utilization is preventing much higher frame rates, at least when exploring the open world. Once indoors, the game routinely managed to hit the maximum refresh rate of my display, but without needing to increase overall utilization given the simplification of the scenes. This made dialing in the right settings for both tricky, especially when making use of the game's most taxing ray tracing settings, which could routinely drag down the frame rate below 60fps at 1440p without any upscaling help. Insomniac did improve performance on AMD CPUs with a patch a day before publishing, and it plans to continue optimizing this further.If you need to make use of the various upscaling options on offer, however, Spider-Man Remastered does come with some small caveats. You have three options to choose from, including Nvidia's DLSS, AMD's FSR 2.0 (which is still in early implementation, according to Insomniac), and IGTI (Insomniac Games Temporal Injection), each of which can be combined with a dynamic resolution option that targets a variety of base frame rates. Testing both DLSS and ITGI at their balanced presets, there's a noticeable improvement to GPU utilization but a smaller one on perceivable frame rates, given the open world's heavy reliance on CPU power. That's combined with an equally noticeable degradation to image quality, with ray-traced reflections suffering the most. Most notably when using DLSS, reflections feature a lot more noise when upscaled, to the point where they can seem in motion on static objects in some cases (scenes where rain is present are particularly bothersome)--a far cry from the pristine representation at native resolution rendering. It's, thankfully, far less noticeable in motion, but it might be too big of a concession given that your performance uplift could be negligible depending on your choice of processor, and whether or not the game is actually GPU-limited in most scenarios.Spider-Man Remastered is playable with a keyboard and mouse, too, now, but it's still best enjoyed with a controller. Full support is offered for all controllers that make use of Steam's API, with the correct button-mapping showing up in-game for Xbox and Sony DualSense controllers alike. The DualSense benefits from the work done on the PS5 version to include more accurate haptic and adaptive trigger support, but like all other games that utilize these features, you'll have to use the DualSense wired directly to your PC for them to work. Still, it's nice to feel the gentle pressure of the trigger that is applied at the apex of a swing, or the satisfying pitter-patter of rain on a gloomy day, so it's worth the hassle if you have a DualSense available.

The game pits Spider-Man against a rogue’s gallery of enemies all trying to assume power in the vacuum left by the capture of The Kingpin, the godfather of New York crime. The story is conventional in some ways, and surprising in others, but for the most part it handles the Spider-Man canon with a high level of care and attention to detail.The first thing you'll notice about Spider-Man is how fun the traversal is. The game really nails the basic swinging mechanics, and offers a slew of upgrades to make it even more enjoyable. The same can be said for the combat, which plays like a modern take on the classic “Arkham-style” brawler. Through upgrades to Spidey’s suit, gadgets, and skill tree the combat blossoms from adequate to enthralling over the course of the game.Some ill-conceived stealth sequences hold the game back a bit, but overall, Marvel’s Spider-Man raises the bar for what a licensed open-world game can be in the same way that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has reshaped superhero movies.© 2023 FANDOM, INC.

USgamer,"Given that it's the biggest, hottest property in the movie world, I'm surprised it's taken this long for a high-end Marvel game that isn't a fighting game to reach us. We've had movie tie-ins ranging from stinker to solid over the years, but Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4 feels like the first big-budget, top-tier Marvel game to release in a long time - finally there's a superhero game to rival DC's huge success with Batman's Arkham-based gaming outings. That's the big take-away from hours with Marvel's Spider-Man, by the way: this is a game that's on par with the Batman Arkham trilogy in terms of super-hero gaming action - and it could be argued as the most compelling display of super-heroics since the original Arkham Asylum.Spider-Man doesn't have the sense of groundbreaking originality, but what it does have is astounding competency in almost every area it tackles. It's clear that developer Insomniac Games worked hard to consider the game's peers: so yes, the counter-heavy, rhythmic combat feels like Batman, but swinging through the city is clearly a mechanic dually descended from the excellent web swinging from 2004's Spider-Man 2 game and the flowing, rapid movement found in Insomniac's own Sunset Overdrive. 

The result is a package that feels great to play, and at its best gives you enough gadgets and options at any given moment that you truly feel like Spider-Man and Peter Parker - a heroic genius, stringing together skills in a way that looks and feels good. At its best Spider-Man gives you enough gadgets and options at any given moment that you can truly feel like Spider-Man and Peter Parker - a heroic genius, stringing together skills in a way that looks and feels good.Worth a moment of praise is the game's structure, which smartly tries to tackle one of the most difficult questions with a game like this: in an open world a hero needs criminals to fight, but too many and the world begins to feel broken and unauthentic. Spider-Man is thus narratively split into three distinct acts, and with each act the world state shifts and changes.Without getting into spoiler territory, it's reasonable to reveal that the first act depicts a New York relatively at peace. All the major criminals are in prison, and though there's a bit of intrigue Spider-Man is mostly dealing with day-to-day crime and quipping large. He's having fun. In the second act things get a little more real, while the third turns the city into a hostile, dangerous environment. One ally suggests it feels like the end of the world, and though the action is restricted to Manhattan it's to the credit of this design that as things begin to turn sour it really does feel that way.This structure also hooks up with your progression perfectly. Rather than Spider-Man's abilities growing as he takes on a static world, skills and gadgets unlocked and upgraded are obtained almost out of a sense of necessity to survive in an increasingly challenging environment. By the time you're maxed out towards the end of the game enemies have gone from fists and lead piping to jetpacks and experimental energy weapons that cleave your health bar like a knife through hot butter. It makes sense. These increasingly difficult encounters with normal enemies are actually generally more impressive than the mixed boss encounters - though those do improve dramatically towards the end of the game. 
 
The narrative missions are well executed, though my experience with Spider-Man's side activities was more mixed. It's fairly standard open-world fare, where mechanics built for story missions are redeployed throughout the world as additional distractions. Crimes crop up randomly across the map, for instance, and task you with saving people or defeating enemies. There are four flavors of enemy base, each of which requires you clear a particular area of waves of enemies to liberate it.These side missions are tied to your progression through the world states as mentioned above. As different factions of enemies emerge more bases appear to be taken down. More crimes crop up. An early, carefree mission has you chasing down lost pet pigeons - later, that same style of mission reappears - except you're now chasing down dangerous drones. There's a decent spread of original content here, though there's the standard-issue level of repetition you'd expect from an open-world adventure. Alongside these more basic side activities there are a few enjoyable side quests, including one that concludes with a fight against a fan-favourite antagonist. Another mission thread teases out an appearance from another much-loved character but ultimately cops out - rather shamefully, that character's full appearance is saved for DLC. That's a little rough.Still, you're well incentivized to tackle the side-missions since they unlock new suits and offer up the materials necessary to build those suits or upgrade your gadgets. The repetitive nature of some of the missions is a criticism, but a relatively minor one - especially since the basic actions of the game - the swinging and fighting - feel so good that you can happily do them for hours. 
 
The repetitive nature of some of the missions is a criticism, but a relatively minor one - especially since the basic actions of the game - the swinging and fighting - feel so good that you can happily do them for hours.My more pressing criticism of Spider-Man is actually related to the story missions, which semi-regularly pull you out of Peter Parker's spidey-shoes in order to drop you into the role of a couple of other non-superpowered characters. I'm actually broadly okay with this as an idea, but the problem comes in the execution: each of these sequences is an instant-fail stealth sequence. These missions aren't broken or anything, and aggressive checkpointing means you're never catapulted too far back - I just think they're frustrating and, well, a bit rubbish. The last couple are more fun as minor skills for these characters are introduced, but I'm still generally not a fan.These are small detractions from the main experience, but generally speaking Spider-Man is a fun, colourful and tightly-constructed game. The combat is thrilling, the story well-told and the open world a fun place to inhabit largely thanks to how fun it is to traverse with Spidey's abilities. The game gives the world plenty of breathing room to be one of the star members of the cast before in the late-game refocusing on Peter and his super-villain rivals, that shift in focus allowing for some great two-on-one boss encounters.Spider-Man is at its best when you're mid-flow. It's a game that can capture that awesome trance-like feeling where you're so in tune with the rhythm of swinging and hopping between buildings or dodging, countering and attacking enemies that everything else melts away. That's when it feels most special, and it's then that what Insomniac has achieved here is most plain. Much of its design is familiar, but it appears here in a refined, polished form that makes it an easy recommendation.

Spider-Man PS4 is yet another Sony exclusive that has been hyped to the max. I have to say that usually when a big exclusive AAA licensed game gets this much attention, it turns out to be a disappointment. However, after God of War somehow blew past even my highest expectations earlier this year, I was optimistic that Spider-Man would be just as awestriking.During this review, I had to continually remind myself to be objective. You see, I’m not a huge fan of Spider-Man as a superhero. Especially lately, the silver screen adaptations have been far from compelling, and if I’m gonna read a Marvel comic there are about a thousand more exciting heroes to choose from, though, I have to say that this game has somewhat swayed me to take a closer look at Spidey. There are also some gameplay elements that weren’t my cup of tea, which I’ll highlight below. However, I also realize that these hang-ups are entirely subjective, so I’ve done my best not to judge the game on how I feel personally, but more with my experience as a professional and long-time gamer.Spider-Man takes place in a reality wholly separate from any other Marvel universe. So, you’ll get to see a ton of familiar faces, places, and hear events referenced that also occurred in different Spidey timelines, but almost everything has a bit of a spin on it.Spider-Man PS4 features an older Spider-Man, through with college and working as a researcher with Dr. Octavius. Unfortunately, this work doesn’t pay much, and despite his long-time philanthropic work as Spider-Man, Peter Parker just can’t make ends meet. Outside of being Spider-Man, Parker is kind of a loser. He tends to let his personal life stagnate, and because of this most of his relationships are strained.Without revealing too many twists and turns, the overarching plot of Spider-Man centers around the power vacuum left by Kingpin’s arrest (thanks to Spidey in the opening mission of the game) and the sinister villain that rises to fill the void. Along the way you’ll run into some familiar baddies and allies, but, again, each of them has a slightly different portrayal and history here.Really, this was the best way that Insomniac could craft the plot. You’re presented with plenty of things that will give you a sense of the familiar, but there’s just enough changed to keep things interesting. Characters still typically have the attitudes that you remember from the comics and haven’t completely changed, but their histories may be different.The main narrative was an entertaining romp, which if you powered through could probably be completed in 15 hours or so. However, there are plenty of side missions and activities which add another 10 or so hours to the game. Unfortunately, this is where frustration started creeping in for me.If you want to unlock everything and 100% the game, there’s a ton of side missions available in Spider-Man. The game takes place in Manhattan, which you’ll have full reign to swing through pretty soon after the game starts. Of course, if you have an open world, then you’ve gotta stuff it with stuff to do.Unfortunately, a lot of the side stuff gets repetitive after a short time. I liked the landmark collectibles, where you have to take pictures of some of the famous sites of New York, but some of the other activities just got tedious.There are challenges where you have to defuse bombs, fight enemies, or use stealth to complete an objective. There are research stations that task you with things like swinging through town to take air samples or spread vaccines for pigeons. There are also side quests where you have to solve random crimes or take out bases full of enemy grunts.Where this all breaks down is in the repetitiveness. There’s just not enough variety in the collectible quests to keep you invested. The fact you have to activate towers to reveal the map also didn’t endear me to Spider-Man.This is one of those things though that really depends on the person. There’s nothing that’s really bad about any of this content, and it’s made really well. I’ve just got to the point in my life that if things get too repetitive, I lose interest quickly. There’s plenty of gamers though who will play through it and enjoy it thoroughly.Where Spider-Man really just blew me away was with the movement and combat. Zipping around Manhattan feels absolutely fantastic, and I’m not sure if any game has quite captured the feeling of speed and movement quite like this one before. It’s just so consistently good.I thought I’d be tired at the 20-25 hour mark of swinging between buildings and fighting goons, but it just stayed entertaining. The movement is radically simple to perform and feels somewhat like a refinement of Assassin’s Creed parkour. By holding R2, you can simply run in any direction, and Spidey will jump over or run up anything in your way.You can use L2 to shoot web with precision, and this is useful for launching Spider-Man at a particular location to either grab onto or leap off of. Once you’re in the air, you have several options for mobility. You can press X at the right time during a swing and gain speed and distance. You can also press L3 to dive while in the air. This can either get you to the ground faster or let you gain momentum to transfer into a swing.The movement feeds into the combat system which allows you to use a host of skills and combos to eliminate enemies. You’ve got stuff like run-of-the-mill punches, kicks, and, dodges, which become more and more impressive as you gain XP to level Spidey up and learn more skills. As you go on in the game you get more abilities, gadgets, and specials that will power you up into a random goon tranquilizing machine (because Spider-Man doesn’t kill anyone no matter what).Eventually, you’ll be able to take on tens of foes at a time with ease. In the endgame you’ll basically be able to execute the Death Blossom from The Last Starfighter, covering anyone in range with webbing, tasers, spider drones, and all sorts of other goodies.By unlocking new suits (of which there are quite a few of) using tokens you get from completing things like research posts and landmarks, you can get new suit powers. Not all suits come with powers, but the cool thing is once you unlock a costume you can use its power with any other suit. These powers can do things like increasing your stealth considerably or launch a spider-bro drone that will auto-target and devastate your foes.Although it has a few flaws, Spider-Man PS4 is another great PS4 exclusive. It doesn’t have quite the staying power that God of War did, but it has some of the best combat and movement I’ve ever seen in a game. It’s also the definitive Spider-Man game, so if you’re a massive fan of the comics or movies, you’ll love this.Spider-Man PS4 continues the awesome tradition we’ve seen emerge in the last decade or so of amazing licensed games. I wasn’t a huge fan of some of the more repetitive side activities, but I had a lot of fun in general and gained a new appreciation of Spider-Man, enough so that I’ll be checking out the comics when I get the time.Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkSpider-Man means a lot to me. I’m not going to go off on a tangent you’ve heard a million times about how Peter Parker is such an every man and easy to identify with: no, I’d rather share a personal story.Games and other forms of media aren’t just mere entertainment. They can transcend boundaries and push art, and offer an element of escapism. For some that means control in a period of their life when they have none, and as a kid in the middle of a messy divorce, all the wise-cracking Peter Parker had to do was cheer me up: but his creators did more than that.Spider-Man goes beyond your typical power fantasy. A lot of his strength comes from his resourcefulness, and his willing to push himself beyond the scope of his super powers to become something more. To some, he’s an inspiration. I’m glad that Insomniac Games got it right.Spider-Man (PS4 [reviewed with a PS4 Pro])Developer: Insomniac GamesPublisher: SonyReleased: September 7, 2018MSRP: $59.99What I like right off the bat is that Insomniac, Sony, and the Marvel powers that be allowed this to be its own thing. It’s not the billionth origin story, it’s not based on the MCU, and takes bits and pieces of the mythos at will.Within 30 minutes of the story Peter gets a call from his superhero contact, his day job, and his Aunt May. Insomniac has made it clear from the get-go that this narrative is about the many faces of Peter Parker, and that frantic focus helps ramp up the intensity, shaping the focus between major action sequences. He still has jokes (“don’t forget the hyphen between Spider and Man”), and that light-heartedness keeps the edge off, a welcome tonal shift compared to many other superhero romps.Spider-Man is packed with villains (Kingpin, Vulture, Electro, to name a few), and given that Peter Park rivals Batman in terms of a quality rogue’s gallery, peppered in members of the Sinister Six is always a great move. It’s just on the cusp of packing in too much. By the time everything really goes down the narrative kind of rushes a few beats, but given that you can take your time and do some fun missions in the open world along the way, it breaks up the pacing.It helps that you actually feel formidable while all of this is happening. Insomniac nailed the web-swinging, arguably the most important element of a Spider-Man game. “Web zips” with X are essentially air dashes, holding down R2 allows for control over swinging, and Spider-Man sort of bounds along any surface you slam him into, running up walls or sticking to ceilings when able. I’m sure plenty of time was spent fine-tuning all of this because it feels like a perfect compromise, something I’d call arcade realism. Even better, swinging into a scene is enhanced by the scope of the game, which plops citizen NPCs where they need to be to give each set piece weight to it.Spider-Man is pretty much the ideal existing character to put into a game, and this project takes advantage. Combat runs on speed and as a result playing it for just a few minutes will make it immediately apparent how different it is from the pack. Instead of following the typical “combo, then counter” flow you can quickly web up an enemy with a gun, then punch someone in the face before they get their attack off, then grab that first guy’s weapon from afar and sling it back into his head.My favorite part? Incapacitating dudes with webbing straight-up instead of having to pummel them. Aerial combos are key, which can be linked to a swift web grab to help you traverse the room. I’ve finished some skirmishes, even at least one boss fight, without ever touching the floor. Being able to use focus (super meter basically) to heal periodically makes you feel like even if you screw up the beginning of the fight you can still recover.Upgrades are also elaborately done. You can level-up Spidey across three (tempered as to not create too much bloat) skill trees and create/mod 25 different suits. I’m a sucker for outfits and Spider-Man does them one better, as each one has a power, and after unlocking it, you can equip any ability on any previous suit — no worrying that the cool looking one you really like actually sucks. Gaining access to heavy-hitters like Scarlet Spider and Noir in the first few hours also avoids the problem of all of the good stuff unlocking at the very end. These costumes go to some pretty wild places too.There’s a lot of heart at the center of just about every activity, even the open world ones that you might need a break from every so often. Collectibles are cute, consisting of things like a portable game system Peter once used during stakeouts, or the menu of the restaurant for his first date. You can high-five citizens for small amounts of XP and unlock an ability that lets you do aerial tricks while swinging. If you’re the 100%-er type, a quick R3 press queues up a convenient pulse with giant shiny on-screen beacons, preventing constant map checking. It’s the little things.Do you still hate QTEs? Well, their minimal use in Spider-Man (mostly at the culmination of boss fights or big story missions) is fine. Pipe Mania puzzles and other assorted brain teasers are part of a micro minigame collection (following a quick required story sequence) that pops up occasionally in the campaign. Hard stealth bits (typically with Mary Jane) are short and sweet. There’s radio towers, too, and several enemy types are re-skins. So I got most of the minor annoyances out of the way: “minor” to me at least. I know some folks are going to get bogged down with the above, and there’s room for improvement. But a lot of it melts away after you’re zipping from building to building minutes or even seconds later.Spider-Man isn’t just a great superhero game, it’s a proof of concept for Insomniac as a company. This project shows that they can basically handle pretty much any universe, because if you can accurately recreate Peter Parker’s nimbleness and gentle heart you can do anything: and with multiple teasers at the end, I think they’ll get that chance.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Forbes,"Marvel's Spider-Man is a fantastic PS4 exclusive and one of the best superhero games ever made.Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 is more proof that Sony's console is the system to beat, if for no other reason than the sheer quantity of amazing, exclusive titles you can't play anywhere else.It's more than a little amazing to see a game as good as Spider-Man release just a few months after the incredible God Of War reboot. That game has already become a critical and financial success, wowing critics and gamers alike with its new surprisingly fresh take on Kratos's story and gameplay.Now we have Spider-Man from Insomniac Games (Ratchet & Clank, Sunset Overdrive) and get ready to be wowed all over again. In this review I'll talk about the gameplay, graphics and the quality of the story itself without spoiling anything important from the story. I'll have a more detailed look at the narrative elements after the game has launched.Let's start off by making the inevitable comparison.Arkham SpideySpider-Man's neighborhood.Marvel's Spider-Man and DC's Batman share much in common. They're both denizens of a fictional New York City (aka Gotham in Batman's universe.) They both wear masks and use high-tech gadgets to take down enemies. And (usually) they're both non-lethal superheroes, preferring to incapacitate their enemies rather than kill them.They even have two remarkably similar games. For Batman it's the Arkham trilogy which culminated in the big, open-world game Arkham Knight. Now Spider-Man has his very own open-world game, Spider-Man, and it shares plenty in common with the Arkham series while also surpassing it in many ways.I am Spider-Man.After all, Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker only share so much in common. The billionaire playboy and the friendly neighborhood superhero are both good guys, but they're not the same kind of good guy.There's no denying that Spider-Man plays similarly to Arkham. You zip around NYC with webs instead of a flying cape, but you're still navigating skyscrapers from on high rather than running around the ground. Fighting with webs and web-based gadgets is different, but still mechanically similar, to Batman's array of toys.The Good.Fly across the city like a spider-god.But whatever Arkham does, Spider-Man can do better. (Before the chorus of dissent, I'll admit this is likely a matter of opinion. I'm usually a Batman guy but I'm team Spider-Man now.)Web-swinging through the city (which entails swinging, dashing forward, doing cool tricks in the air, running up and along walls and zipping to perches) is glorious. There's nothing quite like it in modern video games. In many ways it's the high-definition sequel to 2004's Spider-Man 2 and shares many of the same systems.Movement is glorious That simply can't be overstated. Moving about the expansive, richly detailed open-world burgh of Manhattan is a joy. This is a world tied directly to the MCU films though in an alternate universe where Spidey himself is older and more experienced. He's put plenty of bad guys behind bars. He's had a relationship with Mary Jane that's already on the rocks. He's worked for, and departed from The Daily Bugle. And he can fly through the city like a god. You'll spot the Avengers building and the Wakanda embassy along the way.I love just staring out across this game's gorgeous world.Seriously, the traversal system in Spider-Man is a rush and it gets better as you level up. It's some of the most fun I've had just moving through a game in ages. You can do tricks in the air, run up or across the sides of skyscrapers, zip across rooftops and once you master it, which shouldn't take long, you won't always want to use fast travel (aka the subway.) Moving is half the fun here, and the city is scattered with various types of challenges that become more and more diverse as you advance.There are stealth challenges, combat challenges, movement-based challenges, research challenges and much, much more. This is an open world filled with stuff to do and all of it helps you unlock an array of gadgets, Spider-Man suits and their associated special powers, as well as level up and fill out your skill tree. A good deal of that skill tree is devoted to traversal. Much of the rest of it is geared toward Spidey's other talent: Kicking butt.Combat is a blastThe skill tree.Once again, the comparison to the Arkham games is apparent. This is almost a sub-genre now, with the Shadow of Mordor titles also making an appearance. I'm not including Assassin's Creed because those games employ a very different, much more simplified combat system. Even Assassin's Creed Origins employs a much simpler form of combat than what we have here.That isn't to say that (on normal difficulty) Spider-Man's combat is ever too hard. I still have to play it on the harder difficulty setting (or the Ultra that's being patched in at release) but at normal difficulty combat is fun. You can pull of combos, tinker around with your array of web and tech-based gadgets, and wreak havoc on your unwitting foes. As you unlock your skill tree and gadgets, combat becomes far more varied and interesting. That's good, because enemies get tougher as the game progresses as well.Most non-story combat encounters such as taking out an enemy base or stopping a crime will come packaged with challenges. So you're tasked with webbing five enemies to walls, or electrocuting three enemies at once, or doing ten swing kicks and so on and so forth. You get more Tokens for this. Pretty much every challenge in the game rewards Tokens of one stripe or another, whether they're Challenge Tokens, Base Tokens, Crime Tokens or Research Tokens, etc. These are spent to upgrade and unlock gadgets and suits.Unlockable suits.Doing well in stealth or combat or chasing drones about the city will reward you with higher numbers of Tokens, so there's always another level of challenge beyond just beating the bad guys to a pulp (though never, ever killing them.)In any case, combat is fun. There's a bunch of combos you can employ and they're all fairly simple to learn. Press square and you punch. Press and hold square and you punch an enemy into the air. Now you can punch them a few more times in the air or you can hold triangle to slam them to the ground. Or you could hold square to do a swing kick then follow that up with a series of punches. If you face off against an enemy with a riot shield, punch them once then dodge with circle and you'll slide between their legs so you can hit them from behind. If another enemy is across the street, tap triangle to web your way directly to them.As the game progresses you unlock skills that give you a bunch of new choices in combat, from webbing guns out of enemies hands, to landing ""perfect dodges"" that can be followed up with one-shot KO. There's a lot here but none of it is terribly complicated and when you find your rhythm it's great fun.I like this suit.Top this off with your Focus bar and special suit power. Both build as you score hits and dodges. You can spend Focus to heal or, when it's built up to the brim, unleash a one-hit finisher move. The suit power recharges separately and can be used by clicking both joysticks down. There's a ton of different suit powers that you unlock when you unlock suits, but you can mix and match them. My favorite is still the web blast where Spider-Man leaps into the air and webs every enemy in a pretty massive radius. It's a great way to clear out a room or put a stop to a particularly nasty wave of bogies.Truthfully, this isn't my favorite combat system of all time but it fits perfectly with this game. I'm more of a Dark Souls guy at the end of the day, but Spider-Man is less stressful and the way the combat works, the way you chain it all together and the way you're always moving, it starts to feel like a dance. I like that.The game is gorgeousSpider-Man is a beautiful game.There's not much to say about the game's graphics other than they're lovely. Animations, in particular, are incredibly good and tight, making movement and combat both visually pleasing and satisfying to play. The city is beautiful. There's a day and night cycle of sorts so you get to play in Manhattan in light and dark, sunshine and rain. The cutscenes are likewise outstanding and I'm just enormously impressed with how well the characters all look and how much that adds to the emotional impact of the game. Which brings us to . . . .The story is shockingly goodI don't mean to skimp on graphics but it's one of those things where you'll just have to see for yourself. There was a controversy about the game being downgraded but from my time with the game it looks terrific and I see no signs of Insomniac cutting back on the graphics.Spider-Man and MJ.Where the game shines even more brightly is its story. It's one of the best Spider-Man stories outside of the comics---period. I enjoyed it as much as the best of the Spider-Man films. It's not terribly surprising---maybe to newcomers to the Spider-Man mythos and the cast of villains surrounding Peter Parker---but the surprises don't carry the story regardless. There's a lot of emotional weight to the story, which culminates in a finale that's truly powerful. Great performances and solid writing really help also.That isn't to say that it's all weighty and emotional. There's plenty of good Spider-Man humor and levity to keep the game clipping along. It's a good mix. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm pretty critical of many video game stories. I'm very impatient with cutscenes a lot of the time but I never felt impatient during the game's main storyline.I did find myself impatient at other points in the game, however.The Bad.Lean on me, when you're down.So thus far, most of this review has been incredibly positive. But I didn't like everything about Spider-Man.Forced stealth missionsWhat I hated most, and what I truly did hate about this game, were the forced stealth missions. I'm not talking about using stealth in combat. That's loads of fun. Taking out enemies by distracting guards and then webbing their partners, or dashing between rooftops to silently eliminate snipers, is plenty fun.What is not fun---what I truly cannot imagine another living soul describing as fun in any way, shape or form---is the forced stealth missions where you play as MJ or Miles Morales. These missions are scattered throughout the main story and they are awful. They could have, and should have, simply been cut-scenes.Ugh I'm bored.Instead, we're forced to creep through various encampments or buildings, silently avoiding guards, and if we're caught we have to start over at the last checkpoint (blessedly not the beginning.) It's tedious and frustrating. Even when you get more tools to help you sneak past enemies by distracting them, there is just nothing about it that I enjoy. No redeeming qualities.If every single one of these forced stealth missions had been struck from the game before release, this would have been a much more positive review. As it stands, including them strikes me as rather boneheaded and out of touch with what gamers actually enjoy (i.e. fun.)Repetitive mini-gamesThere are a variety of mini-games in Spider-Man. Mostly these are simplistic puzzles that require you to ""rewire"" tech by adding pieces to a board and getting a line of energy to pass through the circuit with correct voltage. It's fine, I guess, a couple of times. After the tenth or twentieth time it's just boring and annoying.Another less frequent mini-game tasks you with lining up rectangles just so. It's as fun as it sounds.QTE-drenched boss fights.I will triangle and then R1 the heck out of you Electro.Quick-time events are scattered throughout Spider-Man and they're okay sometimes. I'm not someone who usually says that about QTEs which I generally find abhorrent in most games, but there are a few times where these make sense and work okay in this game. Say you stop a car of criminals and then have to jump in front of it to stop the car and have to press square really fast. That's fine.There's a couple big cinematic moments where you have to hit R2 and L2 at the same time, or guide the cursor into the circle and hit R1 just so, and none of that really bothers me (the last one reminds me of Shadow of Mordor.) Overall, these are pretty infrequent.Where I really dislike them, and where they're sadly far too common, is in some of the boss fights. Including side missions I think there are around seven or eight boss fights that I played. I didn't play every side mission. At least three or four of these fights are massively QTE based. Very staged and cinematic, for lack of a better word.Spider-Man can seriously do whatever a spider can except for bite people or wrap up insects and suck... [+] their blood.I don't like QTEs because they take me out of the normal rhythm of the game and they punish failure in an almost arbitrary fashion. (But don't worry, timing is not that important. If you know the button to press just mash it and you'll be fine.)As a matter of course, of principle really, I prefer boss fights that test what you've learned so far and demand that you employ it well. I haven't learned when to press triangle at just the right time when it flashes onscreen. I've learned how to string together combos and use my gadgets and dodge at just the right time. That's what I've learned. A boss should put that learning to the test and make us even better (says the Dark Souls player.)QTEs aren't always lame but they're always lame when they're how you take down a boss. As a cool God of War style finisher, fine. But I have my limits. Fortunately Spider-Man isn't the worst offender here, but I still have to lay out my protest.The Ugly.Okay this guy is pretty ugly.There's nothing ugly about Spider-Man, so we'll skip right ahead to whether or not you should pick this one up. No reviewer can totally answer that question, of course. We have our biases. We have our review codes. We have our preferences and we played the game in five days instead of five weeks or five months. But I do give Spider-Man a Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale.For one thing, I liked it enough to finish it and I only started to get a little tired of it toward the end (and only with all the side content that non-reviewers can enjoy without the need to get a review published on time.) The story kept me hooked right up until the bitter end and when the credits rolled I couldn't wait for the sequel, which (depending on sales) seems all but inevitable.You could wait for a sale, absolutely, but you won't regret this purchase if you enjoy Spider-Man, action games, and swinging through Manhattan like a damn god.TL;DR: Spider-Man is a fantastic action game with great movement and combat and a compelling story that's only dragged down from time to time with boring missions and QTE-based boss fights.Spider-Man (2018) Platform: PlayStation 4Developer: Insomniac GamesPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentRelease Date: September 7th, 2018Price: $59.99Score: 9.5/10A review code was provided for the purposes of this review.

Login NowSpider-Man fans just hit the jackpot.Throughout the studio's 24-year history, Insomniac Games has managed to earn a prestigious reputation by creating some of the most polished, charming, and visually impressive titles ever to land on home consoles. The developer's eye for what makes a game fun, to say nothing of its ability to weave action and humor together into family-friendly experiences, is likely the reason why it was chosen to develop a game based around Marvel's iconic web-slinger Spider-Man. This was a big score for Insomniac, and the resulting marriage between the developer and Marvel's classic IP has resulted not only in one of the most ambitious video games Insomniac has ever created, but arguably the best Spider-Man video game ever made.The basic pitch for Marvel's Spider-Man touches on all the usual high points of Insomniac-developed games: a third-person action-adventure stuffed with collectibles, unlockables, and an array of upgradeable gadgets and goodies. The biggest shift this time around, at least when compared to previous Insomniac releases, is the new title's open-world styling: unlike many of the games in Insomniac's library, Marvel's Spider-Man takes place within a single densely populated city.Shortly after dropping into the game's sprawling recreation of Manhattan, players will be introduced to the web-slinger's arsenal of traversal and combat abilities. In typical Insomniac fashion, the controls and mechanics are easy to grasp: holding R2 allows Spider-Man to swing between buildings, run up walls, and engage parkour mode to quickly run and jump over ground-based obstacles. The L2 button corresponds to specific aiming, either for precise deployment of gadgets or for zipping to specific points. The X button is used to jump, Circle dodges, and Square triggers standard attacks while Triangle is used for web-based attacks.Beyond traversal and combat abilities, Spider-Man also has access to several suits, suit mods, and gadgets that can sometimes drastically change the approach to any given mission. The default suit power allows Spider-Man to quickly gain Focus, which is used either to heal the hero or for instant-knockout hits, but later suit powers allow him to cover an area in webbing, increase his stealth capabilities, or even temporarily lower gravity in order to cover more ground or juggle foes with mid-air attacks. Even better, players can mix and match suits, suit powers, and suit mods to best work toward their preferred play style.As a result, the game allows for a remarkable degree of freedom when it comes to tackling different challenges. It's entirely possible to use a strict stealth approach in some missions, picking off combatants from a nearby perch or sneaking up behind them for a one-hit knockout. It's also possible to go in guns blazing, so to speak, by dropping a Web Bomb or two into a crowd of enemies before unleashing powerful area-of-effect attacks.Naturally, Marvel's Spider-Man offers way more to do than simply slinging around town or punching ne'er-do-wells in the face. The game is absolutely packed with miscellaneous objectives, side quests, challenges, and more. Even better, and in typical Insomniac fashion, many of the additional activities see Spider-Man relying more on his brains than his brawn. Research stations in particular give Spidey the chance to help clean up the city by tracking down or identifying toxic chemicals, to give one example, and players can seek out hidden Backpacks spread across Manhattan to discover little goodies that provide insight into the hero's life and history.These challenges also provide Spider-Man with Tokens, the likes of which are used to buy or upgrade various pieces of equipment. Early upgrades generally require Backpack Tokens or Crime Tokens, which are earned by stopping low-level criminal activities, while later upgrades require Challenge Tokens or Base Tokens, which require the player to complete more difficult objectives or clear out enemy camps swarming with bad guys.Players will be happy to note that Marvel's Spider-Man gets around the overwhelming sense of freedom inherent to many sandbox-style games by clearly marking nearby objectives on the in-game map. Once players are able to activate each district's tower, they'll be able to see all of the quests and challenges in that area — assuming they've progressed far enough into the story to unlock them, of course. In this way the player can focus on whatever activity sounds the most appealing to them without ever having to wonder what they should be doing next.The idea of using Tokens for upgrades also helps mantain a steady progression: sometimes after a mission, Spider-Man will remark that he needs to check back in on the city, and the next main quest marker won't appear until he's stopped a crime, completed a challenge, conquered a base, and so on. By following this pattern, players will not only get to know the city better, they'll also come out better equipped for the challenges yet to come.While Marvel's Spider-Man is overtly an action-based game with plenty of exploration and collectibles, it's also a game that is very much dominated by its story and setting. It wouldn't be right for me to spoil any of the story in this review, but I will say that the tale Insomniac has crafted weaves together some of the biggest characters and events in the Spider-Man canon.It's clear that the folks at Insomniac have stepped away from the more lighthearted tone used in series like Ratchet & Clank and gone for something distinctly more dramatic — this is a game that plays out like a blockbuster film, complete with triumphant highs and devastating lows. That's not to say that it's always serious — Spider-Man's usual wit is thankfully intact — but rather that the scope of the tale may come as a surprise to some players. At the start of the adventure, Spider-Man has been active for years, and players can get a sense of that history through dialog with other characters. It's not long before things start to get complicated, and the ensuing action pulls together not only the hero's usual allies and enemies, but also the city itself.Sometimes the effect is minor — for instance, stopping a carjacking might result in a quick post made to the game's social media feed, or a random citizen on the street might remark that they saw Spider-Man chasing a stolen car. On the flip side, events that occur around the game's second and third acts have distinct and often drastic effects on the city. Not only does the story help keep players engaged in the plot, it drives home the idea of the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man — a masked hero doing everything he can for the city he loves, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.Marvel's Spider-Man is at once a fantastic action game, a dramatic story-driven adventure, and a love letter to fans of Marvel's ever-endearing wall-crawler. It's also one of the strongest titles in Insomniac Games' catalog, and will no doubt be counted not only among the best games of 2018, but also among the best PlayStation 4 exclusives ever released.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code provided by the publisher. Marvel's Spider-Man will be available in retail and digital stores on September 7 for $59.99.

					Kevin Tucker posted a new article, Marvel's Spider-Man Review: Simply Spectacular 
					Was the review done on a regular PS$, Pro, or both? I'm worried that a regular ps4 might not be up for the task.				
					It handled God of War just fine. Sony can't afford to put out games that run poorly on regular PS4s.				
					Regular old PS4, one of the models that came just after the launch model. And, thinking back, I don't believe I ever saw the game lag or stutter even once. I'll keep you posted if I do see some slowdown, but I doubt there's any - Insomniac knows how to make a smooth-running game. 				
					Thanks good to know.				
					Good reviews all round so far, from what I've seen. I wasn't hyped for this at all but now I might have to check it out!				
http://chattypics.com/files/iPhoneUpload_v3503m0xhr.jpg 
					The real question is can he do a back flip?				
					Yes he can! You can do backflips - technically moonsaults - as part of a skill that allows for aerial tricks that fill the Focus bar and gain XP. Spidey also occasionally backflips during instant KO attacks.

					DQ 11 today, spiderman Friday and Tomb Raider next week.TOO MANY GAMES 				
					[deleted]				
					fuckin signed so hard.  mordor? haven't even played it yet.  fuck.  				
					I’m tempted to get it even though I’m getting tomb raider next week. I think I’ll wait, but it’s really hard. Swinging through NYC sounds really fun 				
					Aw man, no PC version? :( :(				
					[deleted]				
					[deleted]				
					Sure can! There are several much nicer suits too. 				
					[deleted]				
					You're going to find something you like. There's one in particular that's very, very cool, especially for comic book fans, but I don't want to spoil it here. 				
					Is it a batman suit? 				
					Forgive my word play, but the suit I mentioned is very comical. 				
					So it's Bluntman not batman? Got it. 				
					It's starting to grow on me. I HATED the white at first, but it's kind of neat. Still, I think I'm going to pick the Civil War costume when I unlock it.				
					Awesome! My body is ready, 3 days to go! Thanks for the review.				
					fantastic showing at PAX, too, they had like 30 screens just for spiderman. 				
					No way, that is awesome! Cool they where at PAX, damn 30 screens is pretty insane/impressive(must of been on Pro's), they mean business :) . I am mega pumped for it! Also very cool you where at PAX sounds like it was a dope year/show.				
					that game looks so goddamn fun. wish it weren't exclusive. sad trombone xbone. guess i'll just play arkham knight again				
					Being spiderman is pretty great.....But there are way to many generic collectibles. This would not be a problem if the game had a more dynamic world. But really nothing happens when you are moving from place to place. That said as a non spiderman fan this game is pretty great.				"
VG247,"Given that it's the biggest, hottest property in the movie world, I'm surprised it's taken this long for a high-end Marvel game that isn't a fighting game to reach us. We've had movie tie-ins ranging from stinker to solid over the years, but Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4 feels like the first big-budget, top-tier Marvel game to release in a long time - finally there's a superhero game to rival DC's huge success with Batman's Arkham-based gaming outings. That's the big take-away from hours with Marvel's Spider-Man, by the way: this is a game that's on par with the Batman Arkham trilogy in terms of super-hero gaming action - and it could be argued as the most compelling display of super-heroics since the original Arkham Asylum.Spider-Man doesn't have the sense of groundbreaking originality, but what it does have is astounding competency in almost every area it tackles. It's clear that developer Insomniac Games worked hard to consider the game's peers: so yes, the counter-heavy, rhythmic combat feels like Batman, but swinging through the city is clearly a mechanic dually descended from the excellent web swinging from 2004's Spider-Man 2 game and the flowing, rapid movement found in Insomniac's own Sunset Overdrive. 

The result is a package that feels great to play, and at its best gives you enough gadgets and options at any given moment that you truly feel like Spider-Man and Peter Parker - a heroic genius, stringing together skills in a way that looks and feels good. At its best Spider-Man gives you enough gadgets and options at any given moment that you can truly feel like Spider-Man and Peter Parker - a heroic genius, stringing together skills in a way that looks and feels good.Worth a moment of praise is the game's structure, which smartly tries to tackle one of the most difficult questions with a game like this: in an open world a hero needs criminals to fight, but too many and the world begins to feel broken and unauthentic. Spider-Man is thus narratively split into three distinct acts, and with each act the world state shifts and changes.Without getting into spoiler territory, it's reasonable to reveal that the first act depicts a New York relatively at peace. All the major criminals are in prison, and though there's a bit of intrigue Spider-Man is mostly dealing with day-to-day crime and quipping large. He's having fun. In the second act things get a little more real, while the third turns the city into a hostile, dangerous environment. One ally suggests it feels like the end of the world, and though the action is restricted to Manhattan it's to the credit of this design that as things begin to turn sour it really does feel that way.This structure also hooks up with your progression perfectly. Rather than Spider-Man's abilities growing as he takes on a static world, skills and gadgets unlocked and upgraded are obtained almost out of a sense of necessity to survive in an increasingly challenging environment. By the time you're maxed out towards the end of the game enemies have gone from fists and lead piping to jetpacks and experimental energy weapons that cleave your health bar like a knife through hot butter. It makes sense. These increasingly difficult encounters with normal enemies are actually generally more impressive than the mixed boss encounters - though those do improve dramatically towards the end of the game. 
 
The narrative missions are well executed, though my experience with Spider-Man's side activities was more mixed. It's fairly standard open-world fare, where mechanics built for story missions are redeployed throughout the world as additional distractions. Crimes crop up randomly across the map, for instance, and task you with saving people or defeating enemies. There are four flavors of enemy base, each of which requires you clear a particular area of waves of enemies to liberate it.These side missions are tied to your progression through the world states as mentioned above. As different factions of enemies emerge more bases appear to be taken down. More crimes crop up. An early, carefree mission has you chasing down lost pet pigeons - later, that same style of mission reappears - except you're now chasing down dangerous drones. There's a decent spread of original content here, though there's the standard-issue level of repetition you'd expect from an open-world adventure. Alongside these more basic side activities there are a few enjoyable side quests, including one that concludes with a fight against a fan-favourite antagonist. Another mission thread teases out an appearance from another much-loved character but ultimately cops out - rather shamefully, that character's full appearance is saved for DLC. That's a little rough.Still, you're well incentivized to tackle the side-missions since they unlock new suits and offer up the materials necessary to build those suits or upgrade your gadgets. The repetitive nature of some of the missions is a criticism, but a relatively minor one - especially since the basic actions of the game - the swinging and fighting - feel so good that you can happily do them for hours. 
 
The repetitive nature of some of the missions is a criticism, but a relatively minor one - especially since the basic actions of the game - the swinging and fighting - feel so good that you can happily do them for hours.My more pressing criticism of Spider-Man is actually related to the story missions, which semi-regularly pull you out of Peter Parker's spidey-shoes in order to drop you into the role of a couple of other non-superpowered characters. I'm actually broadly okay with this as an idea, but the problem comes in the execution: each of these sequences is an instant-fail stealth sequence. These missions aren't broken or anything, and aggressive checkpointing means you're never catapulted too far back - I just think they're frustrating and, well, a bit rubbish. The last couple are more fun as minor skills for these characters are introduced, but I'm still generally not a fan.These are small detractions from the main experience, but generally speaking Spider-Man is a fun, colourful and tightly-constructed game. The combat is thrilling, the story well-told and the open world a fun place to inhabit largely thanks to how fun it is to traverse with Spidey's abilities. The game gives the world plenty of breathing room to be one of the star members of the cast before in the late-game refocusing on Peter and his super-villain rivals, that shift in focus allowing for some great two-on-one boss encounters.Spider-Man is at its best when you're mid-flow. It's a game that can capture that awesome trance-like feeling where you're so in tune with the rhythm of swinging and hopping between buildings or dodging, countering and attacking enemies that everything else melts away. That's when it feels most special, and it's then that what Insomniac has achieved here is most plain. Much of its design is familiar, but it appears here in a refined, polished form that makes it an easy recommendation.
