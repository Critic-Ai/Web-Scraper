Link: Official siteAfter the disastrous Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, trepidation over these remakes is understandable. After all, the latter of the two games offered in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is one of the greatest games of all time. It starts so teasingly, with the right font, the right music and the right menu style. And then the final barrier between hoping and believing is literally smashed down as you careen through that first wall and into the iconic warehouse level. It looks great and it plays so well. THPS1 has been improved so much in terms of fluidity, visuals and its trick system, it’s more like an expansion pack for THPS3. Best of all, actual modernity is shunned entirely as you snap onto grind rails regardless of your approach angle and perform tricks with digital button combos instead of analogue stick waggling. The movement is rudimentary—some might say antiquated—but it still provides some of the finest risk vs reward play ever seen as you chain trick combos and grapple with balance meters at risk of losing everything with one mistake. Crucially, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 feels like the series did in its heyday, even if the games aren't exactly the same as the originals.The main change is the introduction of THPS2’s manual and THPS3’s revert flatland tricks into the package—the latter at the request of Tony Hawk himself. These make for a much more enjoyable and flowing game, with far higher scoring potential. Naturally, the goals have been elevated to fit, but this control uniformity does remove the little variety between the two games, so they don’t really feel that different any more. Now they both feel great. There’s an optional tutorial at the start of the game, and it’s worth playing even if you’re a Tony Hawk’s veteran, just so you’re aware of the systems used here that are borrowed from later games. Vicarious Visions has wisely stopped short of introducing the dismount and climbing features from Tony Hawk’s Underground. This feels pure and right.The game mostly plays out in timed, two-minute chunks. This structure means you can always enjoy a quick session, but, cleverly, the game keeps running even after the clock expires so long as you’re performing a trick or combo. If you’re good, you can theoretically keep skating for another minute or more after the buzzer. Even so, once you've done the treasure hunt style challenges like wall-ride 5 fire alarms or collect the letters S-K-A-T-E, you’ll find you rarely play the entire 2 minutes, due to instinctively reaching for the pause/restart sequence of button presses to try for a better run. If any criticism could be levelled at this aspect of the game, it would be that the slight delay of the transition screen should really have been removed, as the faster you can restart, the less break there is in the fun. It’s still fast, sure, but it should arguably be instantaneous.There are plenty of levels to explore and enjoy, but even if you’ve forgotten where all the collectible icons and secret tapes are, there really aren’t that many hours of career mode before veterans will start running out of things to do. A day, perhaps, maybe two. It's all expertly designed, and the constant drip of unlocks and checkmarks still makes for a very satisfying campaign while it lasts. (Speaking of which, unlocking the ‘mods’ like perfect rail balance basically breaks the finely-tuned skating, so best avoid those.)For those who want to squeeze every last drop from the package, there are loads of challenges to tick off. These come up on the right hand side whenever you go back to the main menu, and beating them unlocks new apparel, decks and videos to watch. It’s weird that ‘finding the secret tape’ doesn’t actually unlock any of the secret tapes, but hey ho. (No, stop that—don’t say ‘let’s go’—that was THPS3. Which also sadly means no Motorhead. But if this does well, perhaps we’ll get a remaster of THPS3 too. We can but hope.)Then there’s the multitude of gaps to jump, special tricks to learn and stats to upgrade. The game is simple enough that anyone can have fun on their first go (because even bailing spectacularly down the school steps is fun), yet has sufficient depth to keep you playing for weeks. There’s frequent joy in discovery as you open a hidden area, fun set pieces to watch and even occasionally some ‘judged’ sessions, where score can be affected by bailing, so it isn’t always just about the mega combos.Besides career, there’s the skate park builder mode complete with several levels designed by Vicarious Visions themselves, plus online leaderboards in a separate pillar of career mode. Sadly, some of these entries appear to have been hacked already, but it’s still obvious which times are real, so it still counts for something to do well.Then there’s online play with a round robin of event types, as you watch other boarders around you, thankfully with collisions switched off. Expect to be royally trounced by master players, but I didn’t experience any technical hiccups while I played it.Local multiplayer is exemplary too, with a smooth-running split screen mode and a wealth of game types including the riotous H-O-R-S-E, where you’re given a letter each time you lose to your buddy in a one-shot combo test. You can still change the word to whatever you like, so you either get called a horse, or much worse. It’s one of the best local multiplayer modes of all time, and it turns out ‘trick greed’ is a great leveller. Graphically, nothing here is phenomenal but it's a strong remaster of the old levels' basic geometry. Vehicles and skaters have far more detail, there's no obvious pop-in, and the lighting and texture work have many standout moments. My Nvidia RTX 2070 ran the game at 1080p on automatic max settings just fine for the most part, though did stutter a little on the longer, downhill-style levels, so some tweaking will likely be required if you want it to be perfectly smooth. Another technical hitch comes when the server connection drops, as the game freezes a few times in succession as it attempts to reconnect, which can completely destroy any combo you’ve got going on. Everything else is exactly as you’d hope. The soundtrack is censored (as usual) but it’s still great to hear Rage Against The Machine's Guerrilla Radio as you cannon around. Turn that ___ up.The fantastic score system, impeccable level design, improved visuals, exemplary online mode and local multiplayer means there’s very little to complain about here. Even veterans who blaze through it in a day will likely keep playing competitively. This is everything it needed to be, and feels surprisingly fresh. Lovely stuff. A perfect blend of authenticity mixed with modern quality of life enhancements. Joyous, slick, high-score gaming that looks nice too.

Metro GameCentral,"Not content with reviving Crash Bandicoot and Spyro The Dragon, Activision’s latest remake may be their best yet.Perhaps it’s due to the impending arrival of a new console cycle, but one striking trend in the games industry this year has been the way in which it has mined its back catalogue to remake iconic games of yesteryear. Following the likes of Square Enix with Final Fantasy 7, it’s now Activision’s turn to apply the wonders of modern technology to 1999’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and its 2000 sequel, two games that helped establish the original PlayStation as a game-changing console.Reworking revered classics can be a minefield if you take the wrong approach, but Activision and developer Vicarious Visions, with help from Beenox, have sensibly taken the absolute opposite direction to the one adopted by Square Enix with Final Fantasy 7. With Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, they have resisted the temptation to string anything out, instead stripping back the two games – bundled neatly together in one impressively coherent package – to their most basic and essential elements.The end result will trigger a surge of nostalgia for those old enough to have played the originals and should amaze a younger audience with its sheer addictiveness and the exhilarating, adrenalin-inducing nature of its gameplay. After an optional tutorial, which stresses key elements such as the role of reverts and manuals in stringing together the game’s signature combos, you can opt to fire up either of the two games from the main menu, or head online for some multiplayer action.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn’t untouched by the mores of modern gaming, as demonstrated by the presence of a skate shop where you can use currency earned in-game to buy stickers, wheels, grip tape and the like for your board. Thankfully, Activision has so far resisted the temptation to include any rapacious loot box-style mechanisms, and the skate shop’s cosmetic items mesh nicely with the Create-A-Skater feature (you can still jump in and play as Tony Hawk himself, along with the original roster of skaters and some modern additions). Create-A-Park, as originally seen in the second game, also returns, vastly simplified and improved.Once you’ve picked which game to play first, the overwhelming feeling is one of comforting familiarity. All the original levels have been lovingly, although not slavishly, recreated (some judicious tweaks improve several of them in many ways) with a level of detail and at resolutions of which the original developers could only have dreamed. As ever, you’re given two minutes per run at each level, during which you must satisfy as many objectives as possible – the number of which has been bumped up from the original games.Those objectives include High, Pro, and Sick scores; a combo objective; collecting the letters for S-K-A-T-E; finding the secret tape; and specific tricks to be performed in specific areas or gaps – plus various familiar environmental challenges, such as collecting hall passes and wall-riding alarm bells in the school level. As you meet those objectives, you unlock new levels, with the number of objectives you need to tick off having been adjusted to reflect the proliferation of those objectives.And that’s the entire structure of the game: simple, uncluttered, and effective. Thankfully, Vicarious Visions has made no attempt to shoehorn in storylines, as happened during the franchise’s long decline. You do level up though, and are given a constant drip-feed of extra challenges, which earn XP and dollars for the skate shop.But levelling up has little discernible effect, beyond multiplayer matching – it’s far more important to collect the stat points secreted in each level, improving your ability to ollie, hang in the air, the length of your jumps, and the stability of your manuals and grinds. Having the two games bundled in one package is great, since if you start off working your way through one game, improving your stats as you go, it helps you to progress more quickly through the other.As in the original games, the main levels are punctuated by competition levels, in which you get three runs to score as many points as possible, with your efforts rated by judges who award bronze, silver, and gold medals. Nailing those gold medals will obsess you just as much as ticking off those objectives that prove most elusive.Online, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 also pinpoints the essence of the game. The easiest way into the multiplayer is just to run a playlist of modes in which you’re given objectives such as being the first to hit a set combo score or overall score, or to achieve the highest combo or score in the allotted two minutes. The former can lead to some very short rounds, and the random selection of levels feeds back into the single-player game, as you get to know the best areas in which to set up high-scoring combos.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepBy concentrating on what made the first two Tony Hawk’s games so compelling and ignoring the extraneous elements that crept into the later games, Vicarious Visions, Beenox, and Activision have more than done justice to two classic games. Games which played a huge part in changing the perception of gaming as being the exclusive province of geeky teenagers; raising the possibility that, instead, it could be considered cool, edgy, and socially acceptable.With skateboarding set to make its debut as a sport at the COVID-delayed Tokyo Olympics, the timing and quality of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 couldn’t be more apposite. The original games turned Tony Hawk into one of the most recognisable sports stars on the planet and this remake is good enough to hopefully bring skateboarding even further into the modern sporting limelight.In Short: A stripped-down, glorious-looking remake that updates the original two games in just the right way to make them feel fresh and exciting again.Pros: Looks fabulous and the controls are super-responsive. Structure keeps things simple, with great new objectives and challenges. Solid multiplayer.Cons: Skate shop has some worrying nods to modern day microtransactions. Levelling up serves little real purpose.Score: 9/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PCPrice: £39.99Publisher: ActivisionDeveloper: Vicarious Visions, Beenox, and NeversoftRelease Date: 4th September 2020Age Rating: 12Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Here’s how it works.A fitting remake for two of the best extreme sports games of all-time, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 offers up more than mere nostaglia, but a potential glimpse at what the future of the series could look like.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The Tony Hawk's Pro Skater wilderness years are officially over. While fans will understandably remember the many (god, so many) times they've been burnt by the return of The Birdman in recent memory, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a well-pitched palette cleanser for the series. It's both a nostalgic love letter to some of the best skateboarding games ever made and an exhilarating reminder that Tony could still have plenty more to offer than just trips back to the past. Mainly, that's because this feels like Tony Hawks. From the second you burst through the rotting wood barricade in Warehouse, every dormant muscle memory seems to screech into life, with the weight, momentum, and speed all seemingly ripped out of the old games and perfectly transplanted into this one. That includes the optimistic physics where you can grind up slopes by constantly starting a new grind on them and managing to grind high-up rails even if you're horizontal to them. All with a chaser of Goldfinger and Dead Kennedys to go with it. And it's all the better for it, because when you're rediscovering old favourite lines and spots (for me, it was grinding in a never-ending loop down by the fountain in NY City), there's a nostalgic joy from playing versions of these levels that are actually fun to play in the year of our Hawk 2020. Of course, heading back to the originals now would show just what time has done to them, so Vicarious Visions has done a stellar job of making the subtle tweaks it introduces seem like they've always been there. There are the obvious technical ones - this has the added benefit of 60fps fremerates compared to the PS1 original, while the soundtrack is a flawless mix of past classics and modern earworms - and some important ones for the skating itself. The addition of moves from later in the series, such as Spine Transfers, Acid Drops, and Reverts stitch old levels together in ways that make combos easier and gives the skating a velvet-smooth feel to go with how it looks. While the mind's eye may always be the kindest, this achieves the most important part of any remake: making it play like how you remembered it, not how it actually was. The developer also pulls this trick off with the visual design. Without wanting to be too vain, good lord do the areas you skate in look good. While the geography and objectives of every level remains virtually unchanged, each has been given a comprehensive touch-up. Venice Beach is now coated in graffiti and Magic Hour lighting, which pops even more with HDR. School actually looks like a school now rather than an industrial skate park with a few fire alarms slapped on, and Downtown's busy streets are even more enticing when they're lit up by street lamps and glowing signs. Plus, in one lovely touch, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2's opening level, Hangar, now has posters for every Neversoft Tony Hawk's game, along with a banner of the Neversoft logo. I could go on, but I'd rather get back to playing. The result of the visual upgrade is that these levels don't look out of place in 2020, but still carry all the old memories you have of them. However, despite these areas all looking equally impressive, there's a noticeable difference in the complexity in what you can do in them between Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and Pro Skater 2. While the original levels all tend to be self-contained, the sequel's versions come with a noticeable increase in scope and imagination. Comparing School and School 2 - which introduced a properly secret gym for you to explore, alongside different wings to skate through - is like stacking the first draft against the published article. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - you can't really knock Vicarious Visions for sticking with history -  but the game's focus on replaying levels means that I find myself naturally gravitating to the sequel's maps.  Speaking of replaying levels, a simple online multiplayer mode gives you plenty of scope for playing with friends or other random skaters across the world. While I didn't get a chance to start a party to skate with IRL friends, Quick Play drops you into a map and cycles through classic multiplayer matches such as Trick Attack (highest score wins), Combo Mambo (highest combo wins), and Graffiti (most tagged items wins). While fun to dip in and out of, it does feel slight in a way the rest of the game doesn't.   In perhaps the game's biggest change, the game's overall structure has been completely rethought to put an emphasis on a whole slew of challenges alongside the traditional checklist of objectives. And by slew, I mean 700-odd challenges. They range from easy pickings such as completing the tutorial to more demanding feats such as getting a Sick Score in each level in a single combo. There's also specific skater challenges, Create-A-Park challenges, multiplayer challenges… and yeah, there's a lot. If you're a cosmetic obsessive, welcome to your Mount Everest. 

Initially, it's daunting to see so many 'Challenge Completed!' signs pop up while skating, especially as there's a healthy chance you'll have no idea what they're for. However, once you start getting past a few levels and getting a steady stream of cosmetics to deck your Create-A-Skater out in, they're not quite the wall of distractions they might initially appear to be. In fact, I've already 100%'d both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 with my skater, but going through the hundreds of challenges has given me reason to dive back in and try different things. While it's too early to call if I'll still be checking stuff off in a month or two, the structure is in place to give me reasons to head back.      Of course, Tony Hawk's was never really about collectibles. It's always been at its best when you're dancing on the edge of chaos, stringing together combos as balance meters wobble worryingly over your skater, all to the tune of infectious punk and somehow making it look as graceful as Tony Hawk has aged. Few mainstream games manage to nail this particular juxtaposition of frenzied calm, which is probably why it's hard not to completely fall in love with it again. From hurling myself off rooftops to A Tribe Called Quest to rooting through Venice Beach to find half-pipe gaps, the adrenaline buzz this generates doesn't come purely from nostalgia, but the fact that this physics-defying brand of skating at its purest still has plenty of life left in it. Vicarious Visions has built an engine that could actually push the series in a new direction, with the focus on skating rather than gimmicks that came from the annual release cycle that the series was stuck in. Here's hoping this is more of a warm up than a victory lap. Hello, I'm GamesRadar's News Editor.

Game Informer,"Forget the weird peripherals, bad sequels, and questionable ports that defined Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater in the series’ later years. Instead, remember the glory days of the late ‘90s and early ‘00s, because that’s where you’re going with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2. By returning to the first two games in the franchise and modernizing them with changes large and small, developer Vicarious Visions reminds us why we fell in love with this series in the first place.The overall structure remains completely intact: You select levels based on various locations around the globe, then hop on your skateboard to complete objectives like getting the high score before the time limit expires, collecting letters to spell out “skate,” and doing tricks over specific areas. Vicarious Visions keeps the best parts of the game largely intact, but various enhancements, including a larger arsenal of tricks, lifts these classics to new heights. Stringing together tricks feels amazing thanks to smoother controls, and the modern visuals look great in motion.While these games are fun independent of nostalgia, as a fan of the original games, I loved how this release gives continual nods to the classic versions. Featuring every single real-life skater from those first two games, an enhanced create-a-skater mode, and nearly every song from the classic soundtracks, this is a crowd-pleasing remaster bundle. Stepping back into the shoes of Tony Hawk and crushing a halfpipe as Goldfinger’s “Superman” comes over my speakers brought a smile to my face. However, this bundle also adds several current-day skaters and a huge selection of new songs. By masterfully blending old with new, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 lands on a sweet spot.All the levels from the original games are also available, complete with beautiful makeovers for the current technology. I was continually impressed by how gorgeous these new environments look. The stages feel faithful to the versions you played 20 years ago, while simultaneously featuring the look of new creations. Perhaps most surprising is how well the levels hold up today; skating through the streets of San Francisco and New York still feels great, and the timeless designs of Warehouse, Hangar, and the Chicago Skatepark have me returning time and again. The levels feature fun paths on which you can chain together massive combos, as well as enormous ramps to launch off, countless rails and edges to grind on, and plenty of objects to smash through. The only downside to these stages is that some of the objects you’re supposed to destroy, like the school’s bells or the “No Skating” signs in Minneapolis can be more difficult to spot since there’s a lot more going on with the visuals now.If you’re looking for new places to skate, you can design the park of your dreams. With a massive set of elements choose from, including smart objects you can curve at multiple articulation points, the intuitive creation tools make it easier than ever to transpose the park from your mind to the screen. Once you finish, you can upload your creation to share with other players. I loved exploring the community feature; my favorite created parks ended up being the zany ideas, like an automated rollercoaster for you to grind along, rather than the more traditional skateparks. Unfortunately, I sometimes got stuck inside of objects in created parks as the pieces don’t fit together as perfectly as they do in the developer-created levels.Outside of sharing your parks, you can also jump into online matches. In the frantic and fun online sessions, you compete in a randomized objective playlist of quick-hit matches where eight players vie for the top spot. These objectives are as simple as getting the best score within the time limit or landing the best single combo, or as off-the-wall as graffiti mode, where you try to tag as many of the objects as possible by performing tricks on them. I love how you’re essentially into the next match as soon as you finish the one before it, with players able to seamlessly join and drop out without everyone else needing to return to a lobby. While I enjoy the structure of the online play, the experience wears thin fast due to repetitive objectives and an inability to play some of the local multiplayer offerings like H-O-R-S-E- and Tag online. Despite earning cash to spend on cosmetics in the skate shop, I didn’t feel motivated to stick around for more than a few rounds at a time.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 makes the experience of playing through these games again feel fresh and current. With contemporary visuals, smooth gameplay, and the iconic soundtrack you remember, the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.

    Mat Paget
   on March 25, 2021 at 10:39AM PDTUpdate (March 25, 2020): Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a capable game on PS4 and Xbox One, running at variable resolutions while keeping that locked 60fps experience intact. It was hard for me to visualize what exactly developer Vicarious Visions could do aside from bumping up the resolution on the new generation of consoles, but after playing both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, it's clear the remake has some improvements that, while not drastic changes to the already incredible game, are undeniably impactful.THPS 1+2 on the new consoles offers two different display modes: Fidelity and Performance. Both modes feature improved shadows and lighting, which makes already beautiful stages like School and Venice Beach look even more impressive. Fidelity kicks the resolution on both consoles up to native 4K while retaining that buttery smooth 60fps; Performance, on the other hand, drops the resolution to 1080p but targets 120fps. On Xbox Series X, Performance mode feels even smoother and more responsive than the already pristine Fidelity mode. The speed of the high frame rate makes an already exciting game more exhilarating, comparable with the fantastic PC version. And thanks to the Xbox's support for FreeSync and HDMI 2.1's VRR, the variable frame rate is smoothed out, providing the best experience on consoles.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 Video ReviewBecause the PS5 doesn't support any adaptive sync technology, Performance mode's variable frame rate is much more apparent on the console, which means gameplay is plagued with frame rate inconsistency. For a game that requires responsive controls and a consistent frame rate, this is detrimental to the overall experience--I found myself dropping combos on the PS5 that I could easily finish on Xbox Series X. The PS5's lack of VRR support is frustrating, as it's the only thing standing in the way of Performance mode shining. Regardless, the Fidelity mode still provides excellent visuals and a solid frame rate. And both consoles show improved load times over their last-gen counterparts.The PS5's DualSense controller also provides some gameplay additions. THPS 1+2 utilizes the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to provide enhanced rumble. The subtle rumble of your skateboard as you manual across the concrete evokes the real-life feeling of your wheels gliding across the blacktop. And when performing a revert, you'll notice a slight resistance, with your triggers locking up completely if you bail. The haptic feedback is an immensely pleasurable feature, but the adaptive triggers were distracting and an impediment to my high score--turning them off made me feel more comfortable stringing together combos.It's no surprise that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is still a spectacular game. The near-perfect recreation of two of gaming's most beloved titles has been improved upon in some smart ways, utilizing the power of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X to push the image quality, resolution, and frame rate to new heights. And if the PS5 ever gets an update to add VRR support, the Performance mode will shine just as bright as it does on the Xbox Series X. - Mat Paget | The original review, first published on September 3, 2020, continues below. It's wild to think that long before there was a new Call of Duty game every year, Activision's big annual franchise was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. It's a series in which you only have to worry about tying off each ludicrously long combo before you bail and lose hundreds of thousands of points. With the sounds of bands like Goldfinger and Rage Against the Machine burned into your head, you scour each dense park in search of S-K-A-T-E and that elusive secret tape. And as soon as you finally find them, it's time to restart the two-minute timer and jump back in for one last go--which you already told yourself was three sessions prior. The stimulating trick system keeps you clawing for larger numbers, while the cleverly crafted levels lead you to new gaps, lines, and secrets to add to your combo's path. It's a special series that is infinitely playable, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 captures that nearly perfectly.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 revamps the levels and skaters of the first two games, though it borrows many aspects from later titles as well. While the trick system's foundation stuck through the entire series' history, various trick types were added with each new release. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 features many of the best ones, including reverts and spine transfers, and thankfully, it doesn't stray further than Underground's wallplants and grind/manual transitions. This makes 1 + 2's trick system feel complete, neglecting the less crucial mechanics--like Freak Out from Underground 2--and focusing on the best aspects of the series' tricks. One very nice touch, however, lets you switch between the revamped trick system and the first and second game's trick systems, offering a more authentic experience akin to the originals.No matter which trick system you go with, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 plays fantastically. While you still control it the exact same way you would the originals, it feels a lot less stiff. Tricks are as exciting to pull off as they've ever been, but the speed of the game moves faster and the skaters' animations are a lot more fluid. Transitioning from grab tricks and spins into a string of manuals and then finishing with a set of grind transitions feels incredible--it evokes the series' early days of nailing unrealistic and goofy combos, while also remaining engaging and exciting when you're checking off goals in 2020.Levels have received makeovers, and each one looks absolutely stunning. Whether you're skating on Venice Beach or bombing it through the dilapidated Mall, it's quite shocking to see these classic stages with much more detail--and with much less fog than on the original PlayStation. The sunset on Venice Beach hits with vibrant oranges and reds that give a whole new mood to the oceanside level, while the Mall is overgrown with plants and plywood-barricaded stores; it almost looks post-apocalyptic. I never saw the Mall as abandoned or even run-down, but this new take--along with many other new looks--afforded by an increase in details makes it feel like you're experiencing a brand-new level, even if the layout is the same.Some stages feature subtle new touches such as drones filming you in Downhill Jam or a stray cat running in the background of Warehouse. These small details breathe life into levels that felt lonely and lifeless in their original releases. It's really quite charming. However, loading into some of the parks can take a considerable amount of time--starting up Streets, San Francisco, for the first time made me think the game had crashed. Restarting your run (something you'll likely do a lot of) can also take up to five seconds in some instances. The original games were quite snappy, and you were able to restart your run quickly if you weren't happy with how your session was going. Five seconds isn't a big deal and didn't impede my enjoyment too much, but when the rest of the game nails the THPS experience, it's hard not to notice the smallest of divergences.Pro Skater 1 + 2 also sees the addition of collectible stat points. These were introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Prior to that game, you would collect cash hidden throughout each level and spend it on upgrading your skater. Original developer Neversoft did a great job hiding this cash throughout each level, encouraging you to explore every nook and perform tricks on every cranny. Pro Skater 1 + 2's stat points miss the mark since you don't have to explore an entire level to collect everything. Because the levels are so well designed, it's disappointing to see that covering the entire map isn't required to complete every goal.Many of the original games' goals are present, with a few added to beef up the meager THPS1 checklists. Among other things, these goals task you with collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, performing specific tricks at specific spots, and causing general mayhem--for example, destroying cop cars or draining public fountains. Once you complete a goal, it's completed for every skater. In the original games, each skater had their own career to play through, giving you the option to complete all of the goals with every playable skater. Once I finished my first playthrough with Rodney Mullen, I started up a playthrough with Leticia Bufoni only to find that all of the goals had already been completed. I can still play through every level to collect her stat points, but it can feel oddly empty without these objectives.That said, you're not left without stuff to do once you've finished your first playthrough. THPS 1 + 2 introduces a whole slate of challenges that have you completing specific feats with each skater on each park. These include performing different kinds of combos, doing specific things on specific levels, and various other tasks. While a challenge isn't your typical Tony Hawk goal, they do add a layer of objectives that are well worth taking on--and there are a lot of them. Some of these challenges are pretty tough, too, which makes it particularly rewarding when you start ticking them off. THPS's core mechanics are engaging enough to be the sole reason you play, but these challenges give you compelling new goals to chase as you extend combos and try to best your top scores.Completing challenges also rewards you with new decks, gear, and other items in addition to money and XP, which can unlock even more gear. The real professional skaters featured in the game have specific clothing and decks you can unlock, while all of the purchased and unlocked items can be equipped to your created skaters. There are no signs of real-money microtransactions; instead, you'll need to rely on completing challenges to accrue more in-game cash. This feels fair, and aside from some visual flair, there is no effect on your points, combos, or anything else. It's all about making your created skater look cool, which is easy to do with the wide selection of gear, from punk-oriented threads to the most stylish drip (plus a well-crafted character creator that offers a good variety of options).The soundtrack also boasts music fit for a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game. Many of the original tracks return for 1 + 2, but a lot of new music is also included. These all fit in with the rest of the tracks, and if it wasn't for their respective release dates, it's easy to imagine them on the original soundtracks. It's an eclectic mix of hip hop and punk, with impeccable inclusions like ""Can I Kick It?"" by A Tribe Called Quest, ""She's Famous Now"" by Reel Big Fish, and ""Shutdown"" by Skepta. The music also reacts to your gameplay, adding a subtle reverb when you fill your special meter and a slight muffle when you bail. It's a well-used soundtrack that reminds me of why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is remembered for its music as much as its mechanics.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 also comes with some multiplayer features, including Create-a-Park and various versus modes. Create-a-Park lets you do exactly as it says, and it's a pretty extensive and easy-to-use tool for creating your own levels. You have to unlock cosmetic parts for your custom parks through challenges, but you get all of the necessities by default, which is enough to create a playable and entertaining park. Sharing levels with other players is also possible, and there are already a number of custom parks that show off both quality and silliness. Because you can share your maps, it's a far more enjoyable mode than it ever was in its early days, and I'm really excited to see what a potential community creates.As for its multiplayer, THPS 1 + 2 offers both local and online versus modes. A lot of the game types take after the original games' multiplayer, with modes like Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Tag as well as new ones like Combo Mambo and Score Challenge. Horse, one of the all-time best modes, also returns, and while it's mostly a great time, some infrequent frame dropping can occur. It's a bit surprising, since you just take turns trying to outdo your friend's score and it doesn't feel particularly demanding. Even more surprising is the fact that the split-screen modes don't come with these performance issues. The online multiplayer, on the other hand, runs very well as it rotates through various modes in a lobby--it’s an exciting way to hang out with friends, skate, and compete for the highest score.Because it nails so much about that original Tony Hawk experience, it's really hard to be mad at Pro Skater 1 + 2 for any of its downsides. The load times aren't enough to keep you away from the plethora of satisfying combos, and the lack of level goals for every skater isn't enough to keep you from jumping back in with a new character. Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable, and that on its own is enough to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a success. However, smart additions and an engaging challenge system make it an experience that's more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk's past.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:An impossible game in 2020Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was a series doomed from the beginning. The idea itself was perfect: What if a game let you skate in all those amazing places around your city — and in some cases, around the world — that you’ve always dreamed of seeing while atop your board? What if your school, an airplane hangar, or the local mall were just yours, and you were free to try pretty much any trick you could think of? Each round was two minutes of bliss as you tried to nail a longer combo, increase your score, or master the perfect run of tricks. It was all for you, and the limitations of each run were just as important as the possibilities. The first Pro Skater was released in 1999, back when people still traded VHS tapes and kids got yelled at for skating in parking lots. If there were ever a game that introduced a mainstream audience to a niche lifestyle, this was it. Suddenly, the masses got an idea of why people skate, and saw a grinning, goofy face of the sport in Tony Hawk himself. It was a series that arguably brought skateboarding beyond skate parks, empty pools, and zines. Everyone seemed to be playing it, in trancelike two-minute sessions over and over again. We learned the rhythm of the ollie, the difference between vert and street skating, and the joy of the endless combo once reverts and manuals were introduced.

When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The magic of the Pro Skater games was their intuitive controls, which invited creativity and experimentation as players skated through the games’ environments. You’d react to your own performance, improvising to keep runs smooth and clean. The best part? You didn’t have to risk life and limb practicing to feel like a skater. Play it enough, and you started to see the real world as one huge course, begging to be skated.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 joins a proud tradition of Activision selling us the same game in the same series multiple times; it’s the third attempt at remixing and re-releasing some version of this content, after Tony Hawk 2X on the original Xbox in 2001 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD in 2012. But this is the first time anyone has been able to do it right in the past decade or so. The controls and feel of the first two Tony Hawk games have been left intact, with a beautiful visual upgrade and a selection of modern improvements and sly edits of the original content. I think I feel a slight difference in keeping vert runs going, and things can get a little goofy — pardon the pun — after you level up your skater to jump much higher and spin for much longer than any human conceivably could, but these are also areas where I’ve always struggled with the series. I’m curious to read more from the ultra-hardcore players, but as a moderately serious player, I’m satisfied with the solid, if sometimes unpredictable, re-creation of the original skating engine. Which is just what the series needs. Pro Skater was never just about learning how to land signature tricks; it was about how to make your path through each level flow like water, creating something that looked and felt both effortless and beautiful. There was nothing realistic about it, but it matched how I felt skateboarding should be, based on my pop culture understanding of it. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 keeps that feeling, while adding to the fantasy through the rebuilt character models and levels. The updated visual fidelity isn’t a distraction; it adds to the fantasy of actually skating in these places, which is an important distinction when it comes to what “realistic” graphics do for a game. War games, on one hand, can get more disturbing as they approach photorealism. With more detail, the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games deliver a better fantasy of skating through these places. The Hangar is filled with shiny surfaces and detailed aircraft, and there’s something a little sad in how the new version of the Mall level now looks abandoned, with its stores boarded up. You can revisit your past, I guess, but things will have changed. I don’t remember drones from my original runs through Downhill Jam, that’s for sure. Tony himself looks older, and maybe a little creakier, although his voice-over during the tutorials is infectious in its enthusiasm. Look at the cool stuff you can do, every emphasis seems to say, just look at it all! Learn a few tricks, and the world is yours!There are nods to modern sensibilities here, though. The roster of skaters is notably more diverse. A trick has been renamed to address an ableist term and bring attention to the trick’s creator, and there are a range of assists you can turn on if you don’t want to worry about running out of your special meter, or never want to bail. Every park is unlocked to be played in free skate from the beginning of the game, and there’s a new Speed Run mode that tests to see how quickly you can finish every goal in each level. The developer, Vicarious Visions, was wise enough to avoid being precious with the content, bringing more advanced moves like manuals to the first game, while also allowing you to turn those options off if you’d like — along with assists so that you’ll never wipe out or lose your balance on grinds — to keep the classical experience. The most competitive players will never touch those settings anyway, or maybe they’ll just never find them in the inelegant menu system — for real, the menus are a mess — but newer players or those who struggle with manual dexterity will be glad they’re there. It’s been a joy watching my children fall in love with this game by going through the tutorials, exploring each park in free skate, and learning tricks with the virtual training wheels on. It’s 2020, and Tony Hawk and his virtual counterparts are still out here, spreading the gospel of skateboarding. Which is worth spreading, especially in this form. I took to the first level of the first game in this collection as if no time at all had passed since I played it in high school. I slipped right into that same blissful state as I explored levels, reveled in secrets, and enjoyed existing in a world where the only “No Skating” signs existed to be destroyed in pursuit of your goals. The first two Tony Hawk games were created before the series had story modes or sections in which your character got off the board. Even now, the levels explode with an aggressive ferocity filtered through elegant, versatile design that rewards players who go straight for each objective, while also holding surprises for fans trying to think outside the box.  Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 are the sorts of games you just couldn’t make anymore. The concept doesn’t really support ongoing content, as Activision found out by watering down what made the game special with sequel after sequel, year after year. That’s why the franchise was always doomed; it wasn’t an idea that did well as different teams bolted on more and more gimmicks and oddities.But that only makes this remaster feel more miraculous — an act of driving through your old neighborhood to see what’s changed, back when a few skate parks and some inventive inside jokes were enough to support a full-priced release. No one would fund such a modest endeavor anymore; there’s no good way to add a season pass to Pro Skater, or fund continual development through selling skins. It always worked better as timed runs through limited environments, not as an open-world game with various missions to find and complete. The series, when done well, is almost the opposite of a living game, which is a pretty punk-rock thing to be in 2020. The soundtrack is still expertly selected, with enough of the classic songs included to bring older players back to their youth. The game’s controls and combo systems hew close enough to the originals that my old muscle memory kicked in immediately. I’ve still not unlocked every park, and I suspect there are more new secrets that I haven’t seen in the levels I have played, but the amount of content is almost beside the point. Once I’ve mastered the game, as I originally did in my youth, I’ll likely return to it again and again, trying to improve my strategies and losing myself in the mechanical beauty of the level design and controls. Online play — which we haven’t tried before the public launch — plus the ability to create and share your own skate parks, the create-a-skater mode, and even couch co-op will also help keep this game active in my library for a long time to come. I’m also looking forward to seeing the secret skaters that have been hidden in this release. After a few hours, I even got the same dull ache in the same parts of my hands, the parts that most other games don’t tax quite so severely as Tony Hawk’s games do. Everything I love about the original is still here; it’s just a little older, a little kinder, and a lot better looking.Just like Tony Hawk himself. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 will be released Sept. 4 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was played on Xbox One using a physical copy provided by Activision.

Kotaku,"Let’s just get this out of the way: Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is a masterpiece. In perfectly mimicking the iconic skateboarding series’ first two outings, this remaster gives me everything I could ever want out of a game. I am dumbfounded by there somehow being something so good and pure in the world.I first played Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, like many did, as a kid frustrated with the complexities of real skateboarding in the early 2000s. After hours of fighting with my terrible body to just do an ollie—please, why is this so hard—it felt nice to boot up a game where the foundational trick could be performed with a single button. I kickflipped over massive halfpipes. I slid along the blades of a helicopter. I marveled at the unlockable Rodney Mullen videos. I sang along to Rage Against the Machine’s “Guerrilla Radio,” music that would have never been allowed in my house otherwise.As you might imagine, I had high hopes for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—which we’ll call THPS1+2 from now on because that name is way too unwieldy. We haven’t had a good Tony Hawk game for a decade or more, depending on who you ask. Frankly, I haven’t been all that impressed with the series since Tony Hawk’s Underground took up a near-permanent residence in my GameCube in late 2003, and none have reached the impeccable heights of 2000 follow-up Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2.The idea of one of my favorite games of all time getting dolled up for a date with modern consoles was a dream come true. Thankfully, Vicarious Visions nailed it with THPS1+2. Since getting my hands on the excellent Warehouse demo last month, I’ve been in awe of the way the studio almost perfectly replicated the mechanics of the original games. While there’s a detailed tutorial to get newcomers and veterans up to speed, muscle memory took over almost immediately. I had no problem quickly busting out huge combos—well, huge for me—and completing objectives in the full game.THPS1+2 also features a host of smaller changes that makes it that much better. Mechanics from later games, like manuals, reverts, and spine transfers, have been added to the basics, opening up additional scoring opportunities in levels where they weren’t previously available. New challenges extend the amount of time you spend in each stage. Heck, you can even press in the right control stick to skip the current song if you’re just not feeling it. I also appreciated that the music is consistent, which means that restarting a run to get a trick or challenge down just right won’t result in a hitching, skipping soundtrack.""Turn that shit up.""Skateboarding simulatorReverence for everything that made the originals specials, upgraded visuals, new skaters.Tricky camera.Vicarious VisionsPlayStation 4, Xbox One (played), PCSeptember 4, 2020100% completed both campaigns.That said, THPS1+2 is mostly the same game—or games, I guess. The levels, while much prettier this time around, are so close to perfect that I couldn’t pick out any major changes. Secret areas are still unlocked in the same way, such as grinding the helicopter in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2’s Hangar level. I was even able to use decades-old guides when I couldn’t remember where the next letter in S-K-A-T-E or a secret video tape was hidden. It was like returning to a childhood home and being awash in nostalgia, general details eventually giving way to meticulous memories.There are very few gaming experiences like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater these days. Skateboarding games have only grown more and more complex. And while there’s certainly a place for projects like Skate and Session, which offer a more realistic take on the extreme sport, they’re never quite as satisfying as the series that started it all. Even with all its changes, THPS1+2 perfectly captures a moment in time. It’s a damaged Polaroid photo scanned, digitized, and lovingly retouched. It’s gravel picked out of a scraped knee. It’s a good night’s rest, untouched by nightmares and insomnia. It is, as it always was, exactly what I need right now. "

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 review for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Skating down the Warehouse’s first ramp, smashing through its glass doors, and then performing a picture-perfect Christ Air soundtracked by ‘Guerrilla Radio’ is a transportive experience. THPS 1+2 is a time capsule teleported in from the ’90s, taking me back to weekends spent ollying and grinding virtual rails with my friends. It sends me back to a time when baggy jeans came equipped with metal chains, and when people willingly listened to Goldfinger. It’s a blast from the past, but it doesn’t coast by on nostalgia alone — this is one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful remakes yet.THPS 1+2 combines the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and its sequel in a collection spanning all skate parks from the two games, faithfully recreating every collectible, ramp, and halfpipe featured in the originals. But rather than giving these old classics a mere fresh lick of paint a la Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD, developer Vicarious Visions has brought the series up to date, making it a more exhilarating experience than ever before.Playing THPS 1+2 is like replaying the old Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games but as you remember them with the benefit of rose-tinted glasses. Gone are the blocky polygonal skaters and foggy draw distances, replaced by colorful and well-lit arenas, 4K visuals, and a frame rate of up to 144 FPS on PC. Old parks like Warehouse and School have the same layout as they did back in the day, though they look distinctly better than their 1999 and 2000 counterparts, and more fluid gameplay makes them even more of a joy to zip around in 2020.There’s nothing more satisfying than chaining together special moves across the entirety of a park, watching your combo meter fill up as you fling your skater from halfpipe to rail, seeing through the Matrix as you start to notice how certain objects and surfaces in a park can be used to maximize your score. However, you don’t necessarily need to be good at THPS 1+2 to enjoy it — this is a game that is mindful of its more “casual” players, allowing them to enable a bunch of game mods such as perfect rail, manual, and lip balance to make things easier.Like its predecessors, THPS 1+2 also isn’t concerned about realism. A game where you can skate through Roswell and kickflip past a UFO unsurprisingly doesn’t care too much about emulating real-world physics, so while the tricks you can pull off are the same as the pros’, the tremendous speed and momentum you can gain allows you to pull off ludicrous moves and ridiculous combos.These combos can be increased by using your special moves, which can be activated once you’ve filled up your special meter. You start off with five special move slots and can unlock more as you progress, with each move being interchangeable. Some moves, like the daring 900, are more difficult to pull off and therefore grant you more points, while others are less tricky though will reward you fewer points in the process. These moves are pulled off using specific button presses or analog stick twirls similar to a fighting game, and the variety on offer here allows you to experiment with the best moves that suit your play style.Vicarious Visions know how to thrust an old series back into the public eye after developing the hugely successful Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. But unlike the Crash trilogy, which controversially altered the platforming of the original games, the changes made to THPS 1+2 are all for the better. Wall plants and wallrides can be performed across all parks, allowing you to rack up staggeringly high combos and embrace these classic stages in brand new ways, while more objectives have been added to the original Pro Skater‘s levels to add even more things to do.These objectives are completable in the single-player Skate Tours mode, running the gamut from collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, to making particularly difficult jumps, to performing location-specific objectives such as collecting school textbooks or ollying over parked cars. Completing these objectives opens up new parks in Skate Tours, though you can still access the parks in a separate mode that allows you to free skate or compete in single sessions with global online leaderboards.Extra challenges and an abundance of unlockable cosmetics also give a great incentive to keep playing, with these challenges letting you rack up cash that you can then spend on apparel, boards, and more using the in-game store. There are no microtransactions at the time of this review, so all items are unlocked by old-fashioned gameplay, and THPS 1+2 is all the better for it. The cosmetics look great, with many licensed brands allowing you to deck out your custom created skater in a variety of fashions, while there are also unlockable outfits for the pro skaters included in its lineup.As if it didn’t already have enough to sink your teeth into, THPS 1+2 also features online and local multiplayer. The former allows you to jump in a park with 7 other players and compete in a variety of casual or ranked challenges, while the latter lets you take on a friend in classic modes such as Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Horse. Unfortunately, there’s no option to play in private lobbies with friends, though Vicarious Visions has stated this will come to the game in a future update.Create-a-park also makes its return, allowing you to create custom parks and upload them for others to experience. The tools at your disposal are robust and intuitive, with you also able to buy additional scenery, ramps, and more with the in-game store. Vicarious Visions also has a bunch of its own created parks to play highlighting just what you can do with the mode, from creating rollercoasters to skate parks located inside giant pyramids.There’s so much to do in THPS 1+2, yet I could spend hours just perfecting my score on one small section on one of its parks. It’s the ultimate game for high score chasers, forcing you to unwittingly adopt a speedrunners’ mentality and see each wall, hill, and rail as another opportunity for a jaw-dropping combo.From its innumerable challenges to its tough objectives and extensive customization options, it’s designed from the ground up to leave you always wanting just one more go. But, as any veteran Pro Skater player will tell you, one more go will always result in you awake until 4 AM, still trying to get the perfect run on Downhill Jam.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is a triumphant return for the series and makes a strong claim for the best skateboarding game ever. It’s a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, and I hope this isn’t the last Pro Skater game we see from Vicarious Visions.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 was reviewed using a PC review code provided by the publisher.10Paul Tamburro is Editorial Manager at Evolve Media and an Editor-in-Chief of GameRevolution, ComingSoon, PlayStation LifeStyle, and SuperHeroHype.Share article"
Destructoid,"darkTony Hawk’s Pro Skater left its mark on history…I want to say…within minutes of its release in 1999.It didn’t matter if you skated or not, it was a cultural touchstone, a sign that skating had arrived. While it’s faltered through the years (Tony Hawk himself dates it around 2006, when Project 8 was released), it’s back now: for real this time.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Vicarious VisionsPublisher: ActivisionReleased: September 4, 2020MSRP: $39.99This isn’t the same mistake of a release that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD was in 2012.Split-screen is back, as well as the ability to create-a-skater or lead a selection of pros through a campaign mode that spans the first two games; without the need for DLC or post-launch updates. The other key to the kingdom: it was genius to reintroduce the wall plant, transfer, revert, and manual concepts all at once. As you can see in the trick videos so far a hell of a lot is possible, as the mechanical inner workings of 1 + 2 were not hamstrung out of the gate.That attention to detail is the crux of what Vicarious Visions was able to pull off. Keep it simple on the surface, but complex under the hood. Outside of a few instances every so often where it feels like my skater didn’t quite land how they should have (which could use some post-game patches to shore up), it’s very similar to the old games, but with a framework that allows a lot more combo potential.And what would a Tony Hawk game be without a killer soundtrack? The tracklist is available here to inspect, and suffice to say most of the classic songs from the first two games are intact. It’s all subjective at the end of the day, but I turned off a lot of the new ones out of preference. Thankfully, the entire jukebox feature is customizable, and the R3 button instantly switches tracks even mid-game. “Little upgrades” are a running theme with this version.As far as modes go, this re-release is dead simple — to the point where the lack of fanfare might leave you underwhelmed. The campaign consists of nine Tony Hawk 1 levels, eight standard Tony Hawk 2 stages (with a final Chopper Drop unlock and a secret level), and the ability to free skate or score-attack all of those stages in free play. You can also create-your-own park (or play with a few of Vicarious’ brews) and play offline (split-screen) or online multiplayer.That’s basically it. You’ll skate your way through each stage completing classic objectives — high score, collect the S-K-A-T-E letters, grab the secret tape, and other scavenger hunt-like stuff — and finishing enough of them unlocks the following stage. There aren’t any elaborate new cutscenes or a story, really: even if you create and customize your own skater. The overarching game does have challenges and plenty of [in-game] cosmetics to peruse and buy though, if you’re hell-bent on getting a true 100% completion rating. This “level-up” throughput also unlocks extra content and more custom trick slots.You can even use the same old school guides if you want for the most part (a few things have been added to the original campaign)! It’s all straight drop-in and go, arcade style. There’s a ton of classics here: Mall, School II, Venice Beach, all of which elicit fond memories as I forge new ones with the new visual style. It was a joy to replay all of them again, trying to remember where all of the well-hidden gap challenges were and seeing everything in another light. The first two games are a powerhouse in terms of playgrounds to mess around in and try to find the best combo lines, so it’s no surprise that they still withstand the test of time. Some stages are more touched-up than others, but as a whole everything looks cleaner and smoother than it did with the prior HD release.I do have to say though: this could have used some Tony Hawk 3 levels, even just for the sake of longevity. It didn’t occur to me until replaying the entire series a few years back that the third entry low key had some of the best stages in the franchise, packed with more goal variety. The team could have added a bit of that panache to some of the smaller-scale areas of Tony Hawk 1 + 2, for those of you out there who don’t want to chase high scores or online leaderboards. As a small concession, you do get a few cute cheat codes and visual toggles for 100%-ing each campaign.I’m harping on replay value a tad here because while split-screen is a boon, it’s not perfect. Available for up to two players (Free Skate, Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, Tag, Graffiti, H-O-R-S-E), the mode takes a framerate hit, even in gametypes where only one person is on the screen at a time. I’m glad it exists in any form, flawed or not; but don’t expect to be able to jump into it and have it run flawlessly.Blemishes aside, Activision is doing so much right this time beyond just putting Vicarious Visions in charge. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn’t going to blow people away, but it preserves the original experience with a few modern conveniences. It’s a win.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher, with a focus on local play.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Forbes,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake is fantastic in every way, and true to the original.There was a moment when I was skating around in the remaster of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 when my 13-year-old daughter came into the room and said “So you just get to skate around at a skate park and do tricks?”“Pretty much,” I said.“That’s amazing,” she said, looking genuinely in awe of this simple yet brilliant concept. She’s been learning how to skateboard and she’s gotten pretty good at it, but she’s not doing tricks yet. Well, here’s one way to do that without worrying about bailing. Or without me worrying about her breaking an ankle, at least.I have missed the old Tony Hawk games. Back in the day, these were some of my favorites. I was pretty good back then, too. Not great, but I could string a few tricks together and complete enough challenges to unlock the next map. My friends and I would trade off controllers and play for hours (if we weren’t playing Halo).There’s been a void in the skating genre since the first few Tony Hawk games. Nothing has really lived up to my expectations in the intervening years. And now, 20 years later, thanks to the talent and hard work over at Vicarious Visions, we have both the first two games completely remade from the ground up and they’re glorious.What’s not to love?You have a bunch of skaters to choose from or you can custom design your own. Completing challenges earns you in-game cash you can spend on apparel, board designs and so forth. The tutorial (courtesy of Tony Hawk) teaches you everything you need to know (or gives you a solid refresher, if you’re super rusty like me).The graphics are completely modernized and the game looks great, tapping into that nostalgia vein hard with a largely intact soundtrack filled with glorious 90s jams from bands like Goldfinger, Rage Against The Machine and Primus (plus 37 new additions).The game bundles both Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and you can tackle either/or to complete challenges in timed sessions, unlocking maps as you go, or just hop into free skate to practice tricks. Whether you’re into skateboarding or not, it’s a blast. You don’t need to have any interest in skating culture or any experience actually on a board to enjoy racking up points, pulling off wicked combos or unleashing sweet special moves, all while listening to fun music in gorgeously remade tracks from Phoenix, AZ to Marseilles, France.There are some old games out there that I’ve always hoped would make a comeback. Some have already, like Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap. Others remain on the shelf, like the old NES game Ice Hockey. For a long time I hoped that we’d get a remake of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 (and 3 and 4), rather than the super disappointing newer releases like Tony Hawk 5, and now we have it and it’s basically all that I hoped for.The levels themselves are essentially 1:1 remakes of the original tracks, but the level of detail and graphical fidelity is just insane. (Frankly, I felt like the original games looked amazing back in the day, but that’s how brains work I guess. Watch some side-by-side comparisons to see just how far we’ve come). Nostalgia is key in Vicarious Vision’s design. You feel like you’re right back on the old tracks you loved back in the day. They just look way, way better now.In terms of mechanics, having not played the originals in so many years, I can’t say with certainty how loyal the game is to the controls. We’re using newer gamepads now, but other than that it feels exactly as good as it did back in the day and probably better (I had to change the default inverted controls, however).The skating is as tight as ever. Pulling off tricks takes practice and skill, but you’re not hampered by clunky controls. It’s a smooth ride from start to finish. You will bail plenty, but you’ll be grinding out five-trick combos in no time if you stick with it.Which you should, whether or not you skate or played these back in the day. The nostalgia is strong with this one, but not a necessary component. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is just plain, good old-fashioned arcade fun. I think we could all use a healthy dose of that right now.Other cool stuff:Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 RemakePlatform: PS4 (reviewed), Xbox One, PC (Epic Game Store)Publisher: ActivisionDeveloper: Vicarious VisionsCost: $39.99 (standard), $49.99 (deluxe)Score: 9.5/10A review code was provided for the purposes of this review."

How good is the game? Our review. Skateboarding may not be as popular of a sport as it was in the late 1990s or early 2000s, but skating will always hold a special place in my heart. The same is true for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise, which really dominated the world for a period of time around the turn of the century. Like many good video games, it was released and iterated upon over and over again until what remained was not so great. In fact, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 received a 1/10 rating making it the lowest-rated game ever reviewed on Shacknews. Times have changed, developers have folded, and a new era of the THPS franchise is upon us with a remake from Vicarious Visions. Tony's Hawks's Pro Skater 1+2 brings together the first two games in the series in an amazing package that is nothing short of outstanding. Find out more about why this game deserves to join your library in our review.Tony Hawk is one of the most popular skateboarders of all-time, and his video game franchise was the gold standard in skating games for many years. With Tony Hawk's 1+2, a whole new generation of players will get to witness the magic that was the early era of THPS games. Tony, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and even Bob Burnquist are all back in THPS 1+2 and they are joined by a new cast of modern skaters including Nyjah Huston and Riley Hawk.If you aren't feeling any of these skaters that come with the game, THPS 1+2 has a Create-a-Skater feature that allows players to create a playable character that will work in both online multiplayer and single player game modes. I created my good old avatar Earl Divx, who has most recently been seen in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and on the sidelines coaching in NCAA Football 13. It's a little thing, but being able to recreate my old skater from the 90s really cranked up the nostalgia. He may be a bit more gray than last time he was on a board, but he was back to doing handstand manuals after a few days of grinding for Stat Points. THPS 1+2 brings players back to the classic levels of the franchise's first two games, but with a twist. Players have a new moveset that incorporates a lot of the innovations of THPS 2 and 3. Now players are able to chain together combos off of vert ramps with reverts and manuals in ways that were never possible in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The gameplay mechanics are damn near perfect, but I did notice that some of the THPS 1 levels don't really take advantage of the modern moveset as easily. This is likely because the levels were designed before the gameplay mechanics were created. It may be a tiny gripe, but it is worth pointing out. To be honest, there weren't that many good levels in the first THPS, and that is still true in 2020 even with a new moveset and coat of paint.While many of the first THPS levels weren't that exciting for me to return to, THPS 2 is a completely different story. My playthrough of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 really perked up once I made my way into the THPS 2 levels. There are some certifiable bangers of levels in this package, from Venice, Skatestreet, and even the Bullring. THPS 2 levels are just better and that is still the case in 2020. The levels also hold up very well with the new moveset as they were designed with manual tricks in mind, unlike the game's first installment. Players who want the original experience of each game are able to change the moveset to THPS 1 or 2 in the settings, allowing for even more challenging playthroughs of the game. This game is already teeming with replay value, and little features like this really go a long way to make THPS 1+2 even more fun to play over and over again.The soundtracks for the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 were outstanding, and Vicarious Visions has done a great job of putting everyone back together with some new tracks too. Players who want a traditional soundtrack experience will have to go in and remove tracks one by one until you reach playlist nirvana. In a total surprise, Anthrax and Public Enemy's Bring the Noise song is featured in the THPS 1+2 soundtrack even after the developers said the track would be omitted. This was a pleasant surprise, but there are some things about the game's audio design that made my celebration very short-lived.When a player bails, falls down and the trick or combo fails, the game plays a video tape rewinding sound effect and the skater gets all pixelated as they get back on the board. This plays over the music, and is pretty jarring when it happens. It seems like the developers really went ham with making the sound effects in the game extra video-gamey. When a player successfully chains together enough tricks in a combo to get their Special Meter completely full, the game adds a sort of echoy reverb effect to the music. I think this was done to make the Special Tricks feel more epic, but it sort of sucks the energy out of the run because you literally can't hear the music as well.I would also argue that the changes made to the bail mechanic have made THPS 1+2 a less punishing game than the original titles, as bailing doesn't always end with your skater on the ground with bumps and bruises. Many times a failed trick is barely penalized as skaters just jump back on their boards. This is a bit unrealistic and it removes some of those hilarious ragdoll accidents that would happen back in the day. Many of the design decisions were probably made in the interest of making the game more accessible to players, but it bothered me as a grizzled, old veteran of the franchise.Vicarious Visions has a masterpiece on their hands with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. They handled the remake of theses games with the right amount of reverance while still leaving their own signature on the work. THPS 1+2 combines awesome gameplay mechanics, impressive graphics, and an outstanding soundtrack in a complete package of skateboarding greatness. Some modes like the online multiplayer function could use more work, but the game makes up for any minor shortcomings with the overwhelming amount of things that are done just right. From nods to past versions of the game, to the pixel-for-pixel remakes of each iconic level, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is one of the best games to be released in all of 2020. Congratulations to Vicarious Visions! I can only hope that the studio will be allowed to release a THPS 3+4 on the way to creating a brand new THPS 6 experience with the great framework that they have built here. Welcome back to The 9 Club, Tony.

					Asif Khan posted a new article, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 review: Welcome back to The 9 Club, bro 
					Yeah I need to buy this. Great write-up!				
					I've put about 10 hours into it so far and I'm loving it. Fantastic update of a classic. 				
					This game scratches a serious nostalgia itch. I ended up turning off the music and using a Spotify playlist,https://open.spotify.com/playlist/205IusVHEgJE8LREEr0woC 
					Game is seriously great if you’re a fan of the original.  I’ve always sucked at THPS games, but loved them anyway, and this package does a great job of refreshing the look of the game while keeping the gameplay intact.  				
					Yeah I love that it retcons mechanics into the game that weren't even in 1 & 2 like reverts.  I probably played THPS3 more than any of the other ones and playing this was like riding that bike again, although I am kind of disappointed that there aren't any THPS3 levels in the game... like I would have preferred the game being THPS 2+3 rather than 1+2 but I'm guessing based off the success of this game they'll release a 3+4 eventually or something.				
					Yeah I'm hoping there's a 3+4 too. It'd make for a good time.   I really gotta learn how not to suck at this game though. I know what I'm supposed to do, but I'm a klutz.  :( 				
					Would you want a separate 3+4 release or dlc add-ons / expansions for this one?The mechanics are already in there and the pricing is already such that $20 for a pack with each game would be reasonable. I think it would be great if they continue to fill this one out with as much THPS as they can, but a wholly separate release would probably sell more.Maybe they could do both, and with 3+4 offer the THPS 1+2 content as optional add-ons for those that skipped it. Win-win. Where are my royalties, Activision? 
					Woot. Was waiting for this review from the Asif man. It’s probably the best remake of all time imo. I picked it up, dusted off 18 years of rust and it was like riding a bike. It truly feels like the originals but with less floaty hang time. I finished everything now I’m just working on challenges and getting platinum in each level.  "
